	00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,110
so the first speaker today is heading

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,470
Jacobs about postgresql and Python after

00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:28,730
him Angus Walton are you around perfect

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:31,580
you're the second one heading Reggie

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,129
stark should i take this micro that

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,410
micro should be open okay so hello my

00:00:34,129 --> 00:00:38,420
name is sinning and just like to do a

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,699
brief advertisement for postgres because

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:44,059
i like cute little blue elephants as you

00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:45,920
can see and yeah it's a match made in

00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:48,440
heaven for squares in five so we all

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,070
know how to vary databases right so we

00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,100
use psycho PG or SQL alchemy or other

00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:57,980
tools but of course first quest also

00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,510
speaks fightin so this is awesome and if

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:01,789
you don't know stored procedures yet you

00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,100
should check it out because it's awesome

00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:06,289
to write stuff on the post square server

00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:10,160
with pipe this is just a simple example

00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:12,979
here so we can have any patent code as

00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,350
our body of the sequel function we can

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,930
import any patent module so here's a

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:21,619
random module and we just specify the

00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,080
peel pie tin language here and yeah we

00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:28,850
can cause this function just like a

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,070
normal a sequel function so peel Titan

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,860
is just another language so we can also

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,250
write JavaScript on posterous or peel

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,590
pgsql or some other languages but of

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,950
course who wants to write JavaScript if

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,470
you have piden and yeah the sequel

00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,270
script just contains patent code you can

00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,950
use any pipe modules so you can use a

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,950
full platen power on the postcode server

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:55,340
side so it's just some real world

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,530
examples so all our database servers of

00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,500
course have a really cool API which is

00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:03,290
sequel so why not exploit it to get for

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,119
example monitoring data or metrics so

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,700
for example all our database servers at

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,489
zalando have some utility functions

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,739
deployed which use piden for example to

00:02:10,489 --> 00:02:15,799
get server connections so just listing

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:18,200
server connections and as you will use

00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:21,140
sequel for any queries or monitoring any

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,760
way you can just call this function how

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,010
does it look like we just define a

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,840
function get server connections and then

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,000
use some heightened code of course it's

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,520
much longer but just

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,550
showing you we can do anything here just

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:36,400
reading the proc file system and

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,500
returning the result and that's why feel

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,150
Peyton also has this you in its name

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,000
because it's untrusted so we can do

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,070
anything as a password user this

00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,840
requires superuser privileges to roll

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,030
out this function but anybody can call

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,140
this function so you can do nasty stuff

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:56,740
but also very useful stuff you another

00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:00,220
example we have so postgres has a very

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:02,500
cool data type Jason so you don't

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,470
actually need MongoDB or something like

00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,540
that you can just store everything

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,670
relational and if you really need like

00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:12,010
schema-less which is never really

00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,690
schema-less you can do it in this Jason

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,300
column and if you really want to

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:19,800
validate something and have a little bit

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,480
more strictness for example in our case

00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,420
we have a trigger and validate this

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,330
adjacent field to comply with our own

00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:31,950
type system which is pretty elaborate

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,660
and yeah leaving out everything here but

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,489
using all patents expressiveness to

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:41,799
validate and using lists and dicks and

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:45,190
whatever yeah and in the end tightness

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,540
cool passwords is cool so you might get

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,540
an elephant in the cell on the package

00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,810
to everybody standing there if you're

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,519
not finding free seats the next room

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,080
over there we're streaming everything

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,549
that's happening in here to there if you

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:11,180
can find a seat there that might be a

00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:12,920
bit more comfortable yeah are you

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:19,820
around I've seen you just a few seconds

00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:23,660
ago they're your you're next so uh the

00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:37,810
next talk is Angus Walton called face

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:37,810
buek okay wait so how do I mirror this

00:04:46,190 --> 00:05:18,440
so just go for ya be fine good you're

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:23,330
ready one sec yeah right all right let's

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:26,090
go yep so hi I'm Angus I'm from Ireland

00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:31,820
and living in Stuttgart work as a back

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:34,490
end web developer and like Thomas Thomas

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,330
vault man yesterday who also lives in

00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,910
Stuttgart just a quick mention I also

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,620
made a little D&D NS replacement if you

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,530
want to check that out it's nice and

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,280
easy requires no setup you can just sign

00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,690
up and curl to update your IP and yeah a

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,080
couple of thousand people seem to find

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:56,990
it useful already so you might as well

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,910
so what was I talking about Facebook so

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,600
we all know what Facebook is yeah I

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,700
don't have to explain that a little

00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,320
while ago there was a little kind of

00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,130
consternation in the Python community

00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:14,360
when they dropped support for their

00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:17,300
Python client for the graph API and so I

00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,430
started looking into it and I found that

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,550
the graph API itself is actually rather

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:25,790
nice and you don't really need a client

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:27,860
so to speak to to use it so i was just

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:31,250
using essentially requests and playing

00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,880
around with it but i decided to play a

00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,980
little further and make a tiny little

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:40,040
client we'll see how it works in a

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,080
second so it's only a couple of well 150

00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,270
lines of code and it's designed to be

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,400
friendly to the developer and help them

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:49,520
kind of navigate and interact with the

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,180
Facebook Graph while also trying to keep

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:59,150
HTTP requests to minimum so let's see

00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:00,260
how this goes you import a client

00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:03,320
this is going to be interesting because

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:05,930
I'm actually live programming and also

00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:08,380
accessing a remote service so this is

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:14,510
definitely going to go around but anyway

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:16,940
so let's say you get a note on the

00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:22,280
Facebook Graph so that's going to be me

00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:24,680
so you see here me name is Angus Walton

00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,600
and so on now at the moment it just

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,370
looks like a normal Jason response so

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,230
it's like a dictionary but if you

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,530
actually check the type it's actually a

00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:34,250
facebook node what that means is that

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:37,790
Facebook has gone through and

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:41,690
recursively turned all of the other

00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:43,610
nodes into Facebook nodes so we can see

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,700
that if we look at for example my

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,800
hometown which is Dublin I can you see

00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,410
it's a normal normal dictionary there

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,690
it's a subclass of dictionary but I can

00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:55,910
check the check-ins to Dublin and it

00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:58,370
makes another get request and

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,650
automatically updates and now we have an

00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,380
awful lot more information about my

00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:07,970
hometown so that's storage and cashed a

00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:11,840
you can also yeah so I mean profiles are

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:14,660
nodes pages are nodes you know even

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:18,170
posts and comments are nodes so I can

00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,950
essentially post a comment to well

00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,950
status update

00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:33,090
and I need to specify the privacy I can

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:34,470
show you that later that's simply a

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,440
little dictionary just saying I just

00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:42,180
want to show it to myself and I'll also

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,690
assign that to status so I post a little

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:49,950
status update and if we check my

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:53,370
facebook profile out there we go there

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:58,290
it is and so we can also do stuff like

00:08:53,370 --> 00:09:01,620
then you see I posted it to me yeah so

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:06,630
if I do something like this I can go

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:13,140
post to the status and say something

00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:19,560
like so the typical facebook comments

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,790
basically and yeah that should be it so

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,880
now i have a comment and it's also

00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:25,860
stored in the comment and it's already

00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,050
updated you can also do cool stuff like

00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:32,840
you can simply like the comment it's a

00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,690
good comment

00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:38,270
and you can see I've liked it yeah you

00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:39,980
can be and and so on so I mean it's

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,560
essentially it's just a really nice way

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,290
of kind of exploring the graph and also

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,320
interacting with it and there's some

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:52,430
other stuff let's see what else can I do

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,970
yeah exactly um one last thing if I try

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:59,420
to like my hometown because that's also

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,020
a facebook node it'll air out because

00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,450
the apps that have created in facebook

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:10,520
to use the API which is called Mac Mark

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:12,310
Zuckerberg my hero is not allowed those

00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,990
permissions so we have a nice little

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,990
exception error here so check it out

00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:42,100
hdmi the next one after will be

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:45,050
tomor chatham ooh was that all right and

00:10:42,100 --> 00:11:03,320
 is going to talk about yamel

00:10:45,050 --> 00:11:05,300
reader this is the DVI hdmi yeah and by

00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,910
the way if you run linux and are fed up

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:10,130
with messing with the resolutions i

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,530
wrote a tool called auto mirror that

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:19,220
does your like every push start gets on

00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:21,080
your time okay yeah Mel reader it's

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,860
about modularized configuration made

00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:28,910
easy I'm working at a moving Scout 24

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,490
here in Berlin well one common problem

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,050
we face is we install a software and it

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,110
brings a configuration file that looks

00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:39,080
like that you'd see something conf and

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,260
some information nice if it's in yellow

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,990
often not but I don't care the problem

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,870
is if I want to change that basically

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,610
the only way to do that is patching it

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:52,760
and in our world patching is kind of

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:56,360
ugly and not nice and it's difficult to

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,770
check and verify and so on and I said my

00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,390
previous stuff we don't need puppet

00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,030
because it solves the problem we don't

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,330
have and the reason we don't have it is

00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:08,720
what I'm showing you here so how do we

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,090
solve this problem well we change the

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,670
software or we ask it to be changed or

00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,620
we write a patch or rapper whatever it

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,800
changes the configuration to be

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,690
modularized modularized means instead of

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,730
a single configuration file we have a

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,850
directory with a lot of configuration

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:28,910
files in it and the first one usually

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,770
something like default llamo 00 default

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:33,620
to have it sorted early in the alphabet

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:36,170
looks like the previous one which has

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,570
the default configuration and that comes

00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:41,050
obviously from some apps

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:44,290
software package now we just add an

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,900
other configuration file that comes in

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,630
later and contains only the things we

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:52,030
want to have changed comes from our

00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,070
package and as you can see now patching

00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,170
necessary because we have a different

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,410
file which can be owned by a different

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:02,110
RPM package the way how this works is

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,240
really simple we wrote a little thing

00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:07,180
called yellow reader which is a Python

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,910
library which will take a directory or a

00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,840
collection of llamo files and merge them

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:15,250
into a single yamel file or and

00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,200
the way how it does the merging is

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:23,890
probably exactly the same how your

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:26,170
mother would expect it to happen how do

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:29,380
you use it very simple instead of

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:32,620
writing the usual import llamo and safe

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,840
load open whatever you just import llamo

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,470
load from the llamo read up library and

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:41,380
you do llamo load on the llamo plug-in

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:43,060
directory that's all that's the only

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,740
change you need to do to your configure

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:48,460
it to your software word reads the

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,620
configuration there are several ways how

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,690
to use it you can still give it a single

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,520
file and you save all the open stuff

00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,040
because that's really not interesting

00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,420
you can give it a directory you can give

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,760
it a wild card whatever starcom star mo

00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:07,050
or you can just give it a list of files

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,370
you can also give it an initial set of

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,790
configuration like a kind of built in

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:15,190
configuration and I would advise you all

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:19,080
to start modularizing your configuration

00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:22,090
because it makes your life much simpler

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,300
if you want to look at other things we

00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:27,670
do check out these addresses yet is our

00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,680
open source deployment and orchestration

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:31,120
solution it includes a configuration

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,390
management that works through rpm

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,950
packages and a lot of other open source

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:40,390
stuff can be found on our github account

00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:43,810
here's the obvious pitch yes we're

00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:45,880
hiring and if you are interested in

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,310
automation or like to make the world

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,950
surrounding you more

00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:51,390
then please approach us talk to us we

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,500
have a lot of interesting things to do

00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:54,500
thank you very much

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:13,190
joseph heinen are you around excellent

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:16,310
you would be next and this torque is too

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:18,410
much um is that it yet is that correct

00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:22,220
all right thanks is that the picture or

00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:24,820
is that could be simulation or something

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,820
its place

00:15:47,710 --> 00:16:42,600
I have a mac unfortunately yeah

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,650
alright let's go hi and Tommy I'm here

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,440
to talk to you about seeking compressed

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:59,980
files for fun and profit so my work

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,210
we've got a lot of log files and so many

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,510
that I couldn't get an accurate number

00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:08,460
and we need to compress them and just

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:11,740
sometimes look inside so say is gzip and

00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,330
it compresses but it comprises it all in

00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,730
one go so say I need to look at

00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:20,830
something that happened at 11pm and I've

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,210
got the the entire day in one file I'd

00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,430
have to go through the whole file which

00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:27,850
takes a whole minute and i'm very

00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,130
impatient so the solution is egg said

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:33,010
you can't Alex said to split the file

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,170
into different blocks and then if you

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,820
want to read a small part of the file

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:38,860
you can just skip to roughly the right

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,710
area and find the information you're

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:49,180
looking for sorry about the disco style

00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:51,070
presentation that is also it also

00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,950
comprises a bit better although it's a

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,450
bit slow but the problem is there wasn't

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,430
any library that lay you actually use

00:17:55,450 --> 00:18:00,430
this functionality it was just part of

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,290
the file format and Python 3 has a

00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,800
library for eggs add files which is

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:09,090
called lzma so I modified it to add the

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,970
functionality and i called it lzma ffi

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:15,010
so this is how you get it and once

00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,500
you've installed it it's just like using

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,320
a normal Python file you can call read

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,840
and seek and you can also write files

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,900
with it so in this example I'm skipping

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:28,210
to the end of the file and it only takes

00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:31,720
half a second and then can read part of

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:33,220
the file you can also open files for

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,080
writing and then if you call the flush

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:37,600
method you can put blocks wherever you

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,000
like so say have a logging demon and you

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,370
want to put it

00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,220
a new block every minute then you can do

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,950
that so that's the fun but what about

00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,280
the profit unfortunately according to

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:51,360
XKCD I haven't actually profited but now

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,510
that I've written the light where you

00:18:51,360 --> 00:19:00,390
can lose it and profit so there you go

00:18:54,510 --> 00:19:03,420
and here is some of the other libraries

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:07,260
that read this file format for Python

00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:10,200
and why I've also added is I use cff I

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,650
which means that PI PI's jit can

00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:19,140
optimize code that uses it so I'm going

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:21,390
to hopefully it can be part of the pipe

00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:28,200
I distribution when they're targeting

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:29,430
3.3 compatibility and here's the if you

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,920
think it's going to be useful you can

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,260
get it in pip and if you find any awful

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,980
bugs then you can talk to mount get hub

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,980
thanks

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:56,820
the next one after Joseph will be big

00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:15,270
Nev the charge I have a I have a

00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:28,380
terrible job right now back I'm not you

00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:30,510
ready all right ISIL Jason ok I'm going

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,080
to tell you something about a midi

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:38,250
player i have written in python and

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:40,380
maybe that's kind of cool stuff I did it

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,049
in my private time and it may not be

00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,360
related it's not related to my work so I

00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:49,080
don't know whether it's useful for you

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,549
or not but I just was interested if it

00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,169
would be possible to write such a

00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:57,780
software into a Python and result is a

00:20:55,169 --> 00:21:00,270
paisa script which is less than 1,400

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,640
lines of code and it's a capable of

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:06,240
reading standard MIDI files and send

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,520
them to midi devices and while it's

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,070
giving a lot of visual feedback about

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,940
the file information and what it's doing

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:16,830
what it's doing it has no module

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,500
dependencies so it's very easy to

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,169
install the only dependencies by opengl

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,039
which is used for the graphical user the

00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:28,950
display it's a whizzy why app maybe you

00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:30,960
never heard about this but it's it's

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,520
really you can really hear what what you

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:37,890
see it's a it's not so easy we'll see

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,470
you later when I demonstrated it has

00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:44,340
been tested on stage so forget about TDD

00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:46,799
I have been a hobby musician a lot of

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:49,710
years ago and I use this software on

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,140
ms-dos computer for over 10 years and

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,560
it's a ran very

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,750
stable it's very resource friendly so it

00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,490
cannot be used for example to heat your

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:03,090
office and Finland which we got

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:07,410
yesterday and NSA it has no innovative

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:09,330
features but it simply works because it

00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:12,120
responds better response in real time

00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:15,080
and in the order of milliseconds and

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,430
that's not a easy job for python script

00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:20,070
by the way it provides a very

00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:22,830
nice-looking mixer interface this

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:27,080
transport controls and a lot of other

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:31,260
options you can change during the play

00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:33,270
of the plane time of the MIDI file it

00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,790
also support keyboard shortcuts which is

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,920
redic of the usage when I was a hobby

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,290
musician because if you are guitarist

00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,510
you don't have a hand to use a mouse or

00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:45,720
something like this and it shows a lot

00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:48,810
of information runs on all popular

00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:51,000
systems and the trick is that it uses

00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:54,360
texture ability to guarantee the highest

00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,310
refresh rates and responsiveness so at

00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,490
this point I can show you a picture how

00:22:56,310 --> 00:23:10,280
it looks like but I think it's now time

00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:10,280
to show you the demo ok

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:23,370
hopefully you can see it here yes maybe

00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:25,980
you can't hook here enough he has just

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:29,690
loaded a MIDI file and as you can see

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:35,490
here is he is adjusting all the clops

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:41,460
heard you can change the volume as you

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:44,670
like you can switch off single channels

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,480
and to have a lot of control over what

00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:54,000
is sent to the MIDI device in this case

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:58,220
I send it to the internal dl essent

00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,410
normally you connect an external device

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:04,920
here you can see that you can use

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:09,900
keyboard shortcuts for example just to

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:12,180
hear the drums it's a little bit okay

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:18,300
you can't hear it because there's no

00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:25,740
audio connection you can change the

00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:32,670
speeds you can slow it down you can

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:35,130
change the the key you can change

00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:39,090
everything online and it all works in

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:41,760
Python so let's now you can hear the

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:44,280
drums only you can hear the best only

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,040
you can hear the guitars only and these

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,960
are all very single shortcuts which you

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,540
can use with only one hand so if you are

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,380
a guitar player or a keyboard player you

00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:58,680
can use it on stage and so this was just

00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:03,080
an attempt to see whether pious is

00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,080
capable of doing such things thank you

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:25,930
Martin Lewis Martin gross with you all

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:28,720
right next time okay can you introduce

00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:34,870
yourself that would be really nice yeah

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,850
okay so my name is magnificent yeah and

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:39,700
i will be talking this would be a short

00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:41,920
talk about Python free only code base

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,440
especially in the case of Django whether

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,070
the benefits were the perks of using

00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,550
Python freak as I said I'm being if you

00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:54,280
can find me on the Internet um mostly as

00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:57,360
each each other on my home side I work

00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:01,090
for golden line this is the biggest

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:03,640
business social network in Poland and we

00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,380
have lots of legacy code lots of fight

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,830
on legacy code let's not talk about it

00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:11,020
we are early adopters we are cool kids

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,630
and we build a new project we build new

00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:18,070
projects with Python 3.4 with Django

00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:20,080
wine 1.7 etc etc one small disclaimer

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:22,930
the things i'll be talking may be

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,240
obvious to some of you but it's still it

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:28,600
feels good to finally be able to use

00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,800
them after years of watching with envy

00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:35,290
from Python two trenches first of all we

00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:38,020
begin our source files with this comment

00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:40,510
in Python to the default encoding for

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:45,310
files was asking in Python 3 the default

00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:47,410
is utf-8 remove it the next thing you

00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,240
probably have your files sprinkled with

00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:50,590
those future import so division print

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:55,020
function of salt imports unicode

00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:55,020
literals this is all unnecessary removed

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:03,280
super i love super and super is very

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:06,040
useful in django very very much used in

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,960
django when you are overriding forms

00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,210
models class-based view supers

00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,970
everywhere but you have to type the name

00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,200
of the class you have to type self when

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:16,120
you rename the class you need to

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,060
remember to rename it also in super

00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,230
cause you don't need it and Python free

00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,860
it works with just the parenthesis

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,660
another

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,460
language feature in Python frequent free

00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:31,660
and upwards is yield for wrong which is

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:35,020
awesome there were better examples of

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:37,960
field from but I look for some most

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,950
Django wish one you could do if I

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:44,530
turtles by the school not to use them

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:47,500
another very awesome and discovery fault

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,360
handler it's a very small library which

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:53,080
usually you should use only these two

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,150
lines of code and if your process sec

00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:59,770
falls now you have a trace back and not

00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:02,860
just segmentation fault and a foul you

00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:05,530
don't need to to have mock in your

00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,830
requirements txt file just use the

00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:13,360
standard library replace pip install

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:15,130
don't ever call pip install mock you can

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,270
have a sink I oh it's the new big thing

00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:21,820
in Latin word but I actually haven't

00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:25,450
played with it yet but there's a nice

00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:28,090
demo by American goose teen who put

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,700
together a kind of research project with

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:36,970
Django with web workers or web sockets

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:40,330
and I think I oh and there's one final

00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:41,890
bonus feature with Python free it's

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,220
harder to accidentally use my sequel

00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,220
thank you

00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:57,520
I slack Bernard are you around excellent

00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:15,490
it will be next under that no I need a

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:21,070
big display port or pjs so yes we see

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:24,070
something if it's not crashing okay so

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,690
hi my name is marcin i'm going to

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:30,610
introduce myself if not everything is

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:32,230
going well it crashed fine but you can

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:34,150
see what i'm talking about so my name is

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,860
marcin some people mag perhaps know me

00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:37,330
from the case Computer Club and the guy

00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,220
at the info desk but when we're not

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:41,890
doing the info desk I am with the acap

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:43,990
team a cop in German it's called all

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,150
colors it's beautiful it's a project

00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:48,010
that the case computer communic has done

00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,650
in the past and we're doing it here

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,840
again on the European if you go

00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:55,270
downstairs you might have seen that big

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,960
wall you think that looks something like

00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:01,000
this in fact it's not just there to look

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:04,270
beautiful it's also for you here to play

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,310
and what here today is to just show you

00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:08,470
very very quick what this thing is about

00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:10,030
and how you can use it because it would

00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:12,370
really be a shame if it's just standing

00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:14,050
there nobody is using it so basically

00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:17,380
the technical details before we get into

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:19,720
Python it's a three what RGB LED with a

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,160
safe design PCB in fact one that you're

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,660
seeing here on the slides isn't the one

00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,030
that we are using the one that we're

00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,220
using is blue but except from that it's

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:30,220
basically the same and they're connected

00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:33,340
and they're speaking ipv6 but for your

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,740
convenience we made an ipv4 gateway for

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:37,990
you so you see there's a lot of

00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,080
technical stuff going inside but at the

00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:45,250
important stuff for you is that we have

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:46,810
a pipe in library that you can use going

00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,030
to do that a little bit smoother faster

00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:51,640
we have a library that is called a cup

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:55,840
SL which you can download from github

00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,700
our repository is muted c3 a cup street

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,310
life and there it's in the branch Europe

00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:02,080
ife basically what you do you check out

00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:05,169
the library and then you're

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,669
faced with a lot of files the first

00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:09,100
thing that you want to do if you want to

00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:10,960
develop your own animations is to start

00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,649
a simulation which will just give you

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:17,350
here like this a blank or black window

00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:20,710
then just to get into it your animations

00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:22,929
directory and play for example the one

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:28,659
on animation is called screw if you

00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:31,049
played back it sorry urn I just changed

00:31:28,659 --> 00:31:35,399
that so we can use it on a real wall I

00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:37,690
fail so you can see you have a little

00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:40,450
script that shows what your animation

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,159
actually looks like when you've done a

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,659
developing your own animations you can

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,399
also play them back on the wall

00:31:43,659 --> 00:31:48,669
downstairs it's really easy you just

00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:51,340
have to provide the script with some

00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:52,990
parameters that you can find in the in

00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,519
the github it's basically you provide

00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:57,399
the IP address and the part where you

00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,830
want to play back to so just let's get

00:31:57,399 --> 00:32:03,659
quickly inside the coach for example we

00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:06,130
are going to open the top lid spies fire

00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:07,840
you see we're providing like almost

00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:10,659
anything that you can use to get started

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,399
really really fast the central point is

00:32:10,659 --> 00:32:14,740
you import archive SL basically and then

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,010
you have here one command the acap SL

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,350
sent and a cup SL update we've sent its

00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:23,950
base you just provide a coordinate its x

00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:26,110
and y RGB value here what we're doing

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:28,330
here is 0 is the phage time because the

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,190
lamps are actually quite intelligent

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,529
they can fade themselves to a specific

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:35,260
color if you just say ok just go there

00:32:32,529 --> 00:32:37,840
without any fading set it to 0 and the

00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:41,019
number of the wall set it to one or just

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,360
use the value here from a cup a cell

00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:46,240
number of words and you will be fine to

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,130
go so you just call that for everything

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,960
coordinate you want to change and send

00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:53,649
an update and once you have it updated

00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,690
it just this place on the wall so that's

00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:57,399
just a really quick introduction and I

00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:59,049
guess everyone from you can work with

00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:01,360
that coach if there are any questions

00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:02,799
you can come downstairs and see me or my

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,620
from some of my colleagues we are

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,210
downstairs here where you can trust

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:09,820
right work with the wall and make some

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:11,649
creative animations we also have like

00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:13,929
for example people who already developed

00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:15,950
with the wall they created some games

00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:18,380
like for example snake that could be

00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,820
late with your cell phone you can do

00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,409
almost whatever you want and if you

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,029
wrote some cool codes and it's a pull

00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:25,789
request and we can integrate it directly

00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:27,049
on the wall so other people can use it

00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:30,490
without having to run it on their own

00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:30,490
laptops thanks

00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:42,340
Alex Wilmer Alex Wilmer perfect

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,840
excellent that's awesome um Isaac

00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,850
Burnett is the next he's going to talk

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:52,290
about pie Christine night he wants to do

00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,290
more to do less

00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:17,909
okay we're good to go you good so this

00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:20,250
is a piece of software at first as

00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:22,080
presented at PyCon chillin a couple of

00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:23,790
months ago but unfortunately there was

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,260
no recording equipment so now I'm going

00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,669
to reduce it into a lightning talk

00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,690
format so having said this you can check

00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:32,550
the other slides and the original

00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,310
documentation if you go on my github

00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:38,790
repo and you can also grab me around

00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:40,770
here so i will talk about the tool and

00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:43,889
some real use cases where you can use it

00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:45,780
and because i don't know if i will be

00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:48,389
able to talk everything in five minutes

00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,790
i will start by the end the conclusions

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:52,770
which are the most important first of

00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:55,919
all with this tool what you can do is

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,750
you can start around your codebase grab

00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:59,160
your to those fix miss hacks and all

00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:01,770
these things you want to get rid of and

00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,050
it actually makes it easier for you for

00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,970
example creating a report sending

00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:08,849
automatic emails or some other

00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:10,950
information with you why would you like

00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:13,260
to use it first of all it's convenient

00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,300
you don't have to change anyway how

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:17,400
you're calling it works with a legacy

00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,710
code it not only worked with Python it

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,300
works virtually with anything you would

00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:26,430
code secondly you don't need any weird

00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,270
setup you just clone the github repo or

00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:33,450
get it from pip and the only dependency

00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:34,770
is Python so or Python 3 if you are here

00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,130
you probably already have Python in your

00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:39,720
computer's modularity it's really easy

00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:41,670
to extend there are lots of modules

00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,130
available but you can just implement

00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:46,380
your own and finally it's i would say

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,940
quite fast here i tested this jungle

00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,000
because it's a very big and reputable

00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,200
project most of us know and it took less

00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,589
than three a half seconds to the

00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:58,950
analysis going through 250,000 python

00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:00,990
lines and i found more than 60 to those

00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,730
in the code base what surprised me it's

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:05,160
because this is a very reputable and

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,800
very used code base there were more than

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,220
20 of them that they were five years old

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,450
but you don't have to believe me i

00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,339
connect to them on straight here you

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,869
just run it with a configuration file

00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:19,329
and yeah here you get a simple report

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:24,069
this is the default report on the

00:36:19,329 --> 00:36:26,950
console so there are more fancy HTML and

00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,930
McNown videos here do you see that the

00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:31,089
results are aggregated by the token type

00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,400
to do there was a fix me for and here I

00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:34,980
egra gated them by the author name but

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,690
you can aggregate them by date or by

00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,359
filename oil or any other parameter you

00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:41,920
want and here you can see these are some

00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:45,599
of the tokens that were gathered and

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,430
this is the order that it's folk here so

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:50,710
let's go and talk about the tool the

00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,029
tool basically it's a pipeline pipeline

00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,799
means that it's some function that

00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:57,069
generates some output and this is taken

00:36:53,799 --> 00:36:59,319
by the next function and i divided them

00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:00,700
in several different steps you don't

00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:02,859
need to use them all you can add more

00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,470
them so first of all you need to gather

00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:07,299
files this means that you will detect

00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:09,190
and decide which files you are going to

00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:11,440
investigate for example this could be as

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:14,200
easy as selecting a fail file extensions

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,119
and a repo secondly you want to inspect

00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,819
files in our case you would like to see

00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:20,980
all to the comments then you can extract

00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:23,049
more metadata for example the day time

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,239
that it was produced and maybe you want

00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:27,309
to filter some of it for example if one

00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:29,079
of my developers is on vacation I maybe

00:37:27,309 --> 00:37:31,809
didn't want to bug him with box and

00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,329
emails selling a you have some broken

00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:35,710
code base to say here are the trigger

00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:37,660
actions you could send these to a

00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,069
dashboard or for example if it's

00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,539
something very serious you could raise

00:37:39,069 --> 00:37:42,220
an exception and break the continuous

00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:44,410
integration so somebody immediately

00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:49,029
fixes it then you can aggregate the

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:52,170
result so it's easier to to to deal with

00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:55,390
them create a report create a file on

00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:57,279
yeah this implementation detail because

00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:59,319
most most of the things are lazy

00:37:57,279 --> 00:38:02,529
evaluation you have to process the

00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:03,940
results in the end this is how the whole

00:38:02,529 --> 00:38:06,249
the configuration file looks so you have

00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:09,640
all the functions and the number which

00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:11,769
is the priority and will in which they

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,239
will be executed I use this format

00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,769
instead of simple list because you can

00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:17,079
merge different dictionaries and still

00:38:14,769 --> 00:38:18,940
get the result you want and here there

00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:20,950
are some of the examples of the

00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:22,839
information and parameters you could fit

00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,549
either need to feed them all there are

00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:27,670
lots of diet are default and they are

00:38:24,549 --> 00:38:29,440
not included here so three use cases one

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:30,520
of them could be take control you want

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,130
to take control of fix me

00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:37,810
so basically you would find a fixed miss

00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:39,100
and yeah you want to you do for example

00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:41,530
want to filter out the ones that are

00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:44,650
very reason if something is broken and

00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,570
in production maybe it's good to make a

00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,460
good quick hack and just put it there

00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:49,930
but if it's there for a long time you

00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:54,570
don't want your codebase to depend on it

00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:58,090
so this would be how the function to

00:38:54,570 --> 00:39:00,670
remove these these cases you don't want

00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:04,300
and yet here you have a couple of more

00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:06,760
use cases this is only the down the code

00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:08,440
you need you need any more code and I'm

00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,750
going through it very fast but you can

00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,820
search them and get up SI Bernard dash

00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:16,740
by Chris tonight this is called HTML

00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,740
reports will look here if you click

00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:39,130
radek Yankovic are you around radek

00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:49,960
excellent you will be next Alex Wilmer

00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:53,620
is now yep it's interesting should that

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:57,100
scare me no just get a laugh all right

00:39:53,620 --> 00:40:00,160
sorry okay hi my name is Alex Wilma i'm

00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,550
here to talk here to talk about an app

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:09,760
called chirp which is a way of saying

00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:12,430
sending and sharing data using sound the

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,630
way it works is you've to random people

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,770
that have met have met in the park and

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:19,870
one of these taking a photo and you'd

00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:21,520
like to share it with the other your

00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:23,800
vote you don't have emails addresses you

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,410
don't have any common secrets but if

00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,300
you're both running this app which by

00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:32,520
the way is not my app it's just

00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:39,520
something to use as a base then you can

00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:41,860
play at ur and if the other device is

00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,990
listening that will decode that show up

00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:46,420
into a URL and then it can download

00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:51,970
whatever it is you want to share you can

00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:56,260
share URLs photos bits of text all sorts

00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:59,920
of things now the problem with this app

00:40:56,260 --> 00:41:03,910
is if you've got an iPhone or an Android

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,630
you're you're sorted anything else is a

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,880
bit of a problem at the moment it is a

00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:14,890
it is a proprietary application it is

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,480
partially documented but not totally so

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,330
what I've been able to do is reverse

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:25,590
engineer a bit of it so that you can

00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:30,730
chirp with Python the way you do this is

00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:35,380
to make an HTTP request to the church I

00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:36,570
o servers it's a fairly simple thing you

00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,850
send it

00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:43,050
lump of JSON and you get a lump of JSON

00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:46,500
back the long code that you see at the

00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:48,780
bottom is the complete is a textual

00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,200
representation of the complete sure and

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,450
the short code is the actual data that's

00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:57,750
the payload and that's what makes the

00:41:54,450 --> 00:42:03,870
URL that the person sharing can download

00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:08,340
with once you've actually got this long

00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:12,210
code if you want to play it then there

00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:15,950
is a the very experimental chirp chirp

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:19,500
module that you can download from github

00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:22,980
basically initialize pygame and then

00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:26,010
send a chirp and any device that works

00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:31,920
with pygame and can run Python can now

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:34,830
chip for any of the amateur radio buffs

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:41,250
or audio engineers in the audience the

00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:44,070
waiter works is there are 32 notes that

00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:48,540
can be played each of those in kota 5

00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:54,030
bits you play 10 notes and you've got 50

00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:57,210
bits of resolution the part that is not

00:42:54,030 --> 00:43:01,350
implemented yet is Reed Solomon encoding

00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:06,420
which is the how the error correction

00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:09,210
works and if anybody is good with finite

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,580
field arithmetic or reed-solomon

00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:16,530
encoding please talk to me because I

00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:18,810
would love your input if you want to

00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:21,330
read more about the technicalities there

00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:25,260
is Chuck I 0 is the homepage for the

00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:28,860
application /e eck is the documentation

00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:32,040
that they provide if you would like to

00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:37,920
download the python code then it is at

00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:40,730
github Moriarty / chip pie if you'd like

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:46,620
to contact me I am Moriarty on Twitter

00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:50,180
and finally if you would like to just

00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:50,180
chirp from your browser

00:43:50,330 --> 00:44:03,370
then there was me one second to dumped

00:43:56,300 --> 00:44:07,400
it um that one can I drag you oh dear ah

00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:09,590
there we go so if you would like to

00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:13,310
check from your browser I there is a

00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:21,500
bookmarklet that you can drag into there

00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:25,370
and if you go to any website you can

00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:29,950
then chirp that website from your

00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:29,950
browser thank you very much

00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:41,080
one final word of warning if you do

00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:42,700
download the chirp app don't leave it

00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:46,470
running in the background it will be

00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,470
randomly even if your phone is on silent

00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:55,230
thank you Simon cross excellent you're

00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:55,230
the one after

00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:30,050
alright hello everyone worried about me

00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:33,680
my name is radicand kovitch and I i work

00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:36,520
for a python company from poland test

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,800
takes next and there's basically

00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:44,230
everything you should know about me and

00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:48,950
today i would like to present you a way

00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:51,500
how we are trying to avoid with our

00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:57,260
colleagues to fall into routine with

00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:59,530
everyday tasks and so on so we're we're

00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,600
organizing our internal company

00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:05,660
hackathon events where we can do stuff

00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:07,850
that we that is really fun for us and we

00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:11,950
can use technologies that we are not

00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:16,100
likely to use in our everyday work and

00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:20,570
so we already made a short simple

00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:23,030
javascript game mobile app that can can

00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:26,470
count the number of steps you take basic

00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:28,700
on the measurements from mobile

00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:32,150
accelerometer and but today i would like

00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:36,740
to tell you more about the recent recent

00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:40,340
event when we were playing poker well

00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:43,280
actually we were playing our algorithm

00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:46,190
algorithms we're playing poker we

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,740
prepared a dealer application and and

00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:51,770
prior application and the dealer

00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:58,130
application is asking the prior

00:46:51,770 --> 00:47:04,120
applications and the decision is made by

00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:06,980
the algorithm each player can can code a

00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:11,630
few words about the dealer application

00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:14,630
is just a pyrometer plication you can

00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:20,320
find the source basically even a bill

00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:22,820
out on the github it runs with python 33

00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,180
and the one thing that was quite

00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:31,310
difficult was a poker hand evaluation

00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:32,080
algorithm and I I found one on github

00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:37,510
done

00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:41,950
I mr. alien alien gee he was he was

00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:45,780
actually hehe based on another algorithm

00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:49,420
that that you can find internet that was

00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,770
originally written in C but i really

00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,620
recommend to take a look at it it is

00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:57,670
quite a brilliant idea of how to how to

00:47:53,620 --> 00:48:01,330
evaluate it poker hand deploy your

00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:05,160
application is just a small server

00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:07,600
written in pure python with the whiskey

00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:11,130
with key server from standard library

00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:14,770
you also can can get the source from

00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:19,200
from github that's how how the game

00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:25,030
looks like i can present you a live demo

00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:28,900
yeah so here's the here's the table the

00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:33,360
the first the first game by pressing

00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:37,120
space key I can ask each another prior

00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:40,120
mmm prior with number three has a strong

00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:46,390
card so he will be playing the tough I

00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:52,780
think let's see oh he's got a four aces

00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:57,400
at can't so he's actually a winner yeah

00:48:52,780 --> 00:49:05,440
so the guy with nothing has passed

00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:08,020
folded okay and basically that's it that

00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,770
that are we having fun playing playing

00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:14,400
and challenging our algorithms and by

00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:17,350
the way there is another another event

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:20,700
organized by one of our of my colleague

00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:24,610
from the company he's he's preparing

00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:26,770
European battle which is a game called

00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:30,760
rot when you when your algorithm can

00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:34,480
also take take part in two in this

00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:39,250
competition check out the European

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:44,250
battle calm or go to the standoff stakes

00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:44,250
next below thank you

00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:58,620
it's the best time cuffed this year XO

00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:30,100
that's good just have a look yeah hi I'm

00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:33,040
Simon and I'm here to try and convince

00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:35,260
you to come to pike on South Africa I'm

00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,250
a little bit nervous and pike on Finland

00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:42,070
set a high standard but anyway here goes

00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:51,820
so why should you come well things we

00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:54,910
invented but 12 which is Linux even your

00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,860
grandfather can use I'm not sure if

00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:59,440
everyone knows but Amazon ec2 was also

00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:05,050
started in Cape Town and that's

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:06,790
somewhere to ssh to because we had

00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:08,650
already written one cloud service we

00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:11,260
decided to do another one so we also

00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:16,840
wrote one for Oracle and that is

00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:19,420
absolutely nothing to do with IRC so not

00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:20,650
only are we good at clouds but we also

00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:25,600
have the Milky Way in the right place

00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:27,250
where you can see it and we're building

00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,620
the world's largest radio telescope and

00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,960
which currently looks like that there

00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,860
are a lot more dishes to be built and

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,860
what's more we're doing it in Python

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,009
actually even some of the

00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,410
high-throughput data processing is done

00:51:43,009 --> 00:51:49,160
in Python we develop some cool stuff to

00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:51,170
read data straight from using dma

00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,589
straight into numpy rays and check from

00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:57,829
the network card so that's cool we also

00:51:54,589 --> 00:52:00,950
do some less big things we ported matt

00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:02,210
butler to python 3 at least we kind of

00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:06,079
broke the back of it and do a bunch of

00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,640
the work during the Sprint we also some

00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,599
people's articles it did map up html5

00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:14,299
canvas we recently did a Sprint's you

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:19,099
write x games eff I so that your games

00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:21,710
can be fast we take part in pi week it's

00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:24,680
a bit of a habit um perhaps we take part

00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:28,700
more often and then these are some of

00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:32,210
our games is strictly healthy but it is

00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:34,430
a lot of fun and many of these games now

00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:38,420
run under pygame see if if I so just a

00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:41,059
little plug if you're right have a pie

00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:46,910
gang tried under pygame see if if I fix

00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:50,029
the things that you find so attend we're

00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,920
friendly speak we spill especially

00:52:50,029 --> 00:52:53,150
looking for a few big-name speakers if

00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,869
anyone's interested in coming out our

00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:59,240
way and making out some say hello but

00:52:56,869 --> 00:53:01,670
even if you're not a big name speaker we

00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:05,900
really just like to hear from people far

00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:07,789
away sponsor and there's still a few

00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:09,349
sponsorships that's open and it's really

00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:17,109
cheap because our currency is not that

00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:17,109
strong this is where you find us

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:26,980
it just goes straight south if you run

00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:32,170
out of countenance you've probably gone

00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:34,450
too far these are the details the

00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:37,000
website said eight at python.org it's a

00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:40,030
second and third of October it's this

00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,520
year and you can follow us on twitter at

00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,630
PyCon xalay and lastly just a quick

00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:48,720
thank you to all of the people who've

00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,720
already sponsored us oh thank

00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:54,640
go team I young are you round robin with

00:54:58,599 --> 00:55:04,099
all right I do have to ask question

00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:06,980
anyway the numbers that i got from who

00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:08,690
wants to participate in prince was kind

00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:13,190
of confusing between yesterday and today

00:55:08,690 --> 00:55:15,980
so once more harm can everybody who is

00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:25,820
planning to attend prince or the barcamp

00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:27,290
stand up for one second oh yeah you guys

00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:33,050
down there can you make noise or

00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:35,839
something I was something as one guy all

00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:38,320
right okay um that looks good to me

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:38,320
thank you

00:55:42,119 --> 00:55:48,460
just to inform you um you can still come

00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,140
if you make up your mind later it's just

00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:52,930
we need to kind of schedule how much

00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:54,970
food will have if there are

00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:56,920
substantially more people than we have

00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:58,150
initially planned for food you just need

00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:01,089
to wait a little bit longer we're gonna

00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:03,880
be refurbished the Buffy but it might

00:56:01,089 --> 00:56:05,560
feel a little edgy so just just come if

00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:07,839
you want to don't feel excluded just by

00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:14,319
not having stand up here are you getting

00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:15,910
ready yeah we can skip one sure I'll

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,410
even are you around tomorrow I would

00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:19,270
suggest you try again tomorrow I can put

00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:23,740
you on a list for that after that all

00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:26,589
right okay um anyway just if that has to

00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:29,050
skip again hit our car parts um are you

00:56:26,589 --> 00:56:38,349
there always my presentation excellent

00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:42,849
start walking oh that's the conclusion

00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:45,339
go to you ready yeah alright sorry Sam

00:56:42,849 --> 00:56:47,890
good shayan i work at friar t in london

00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:51,180
and a couple of months back i wanted to

00:56:47,890 --> 00:56:54,460
upgrade my laptop to the later step into

00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:59,109
so the way you do it is you run do

00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:03,440
release upgrade but i got an error not

00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:06,069
that one damn it

00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,069
me

00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:21,170
I guess that's deep this one I mean it's

00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:38,460
I can I can just talk to it fine yes say

00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:40,470
estrace the idea is you can you can run

00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:44,700
your program with a stress and it will

00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:47,339
it will show all the system codes that

00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:49,140
it is executing so you can see every

00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:51,240
file at your program is opening or

00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:54,390
closing or the older network activity

00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:57,119
all the things you're reading from files

00:57:54,390 --> 00:58:01,520
or writing to files so it's very

00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:04,890
convenient but it has one issue which is

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:08,160
it produces a lot of output so you've

00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:11,609
got a lot of file being up and usually

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,359
or read or a network activity and if you

00:58:11,609 --> 00:58:17,940
want to find what went wrong a new

00:58:14,359 --> 00:58:20,130
program the there is a process voice so

00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:22,589
you start at the end of the output and

00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:25,200
then you go backwards until you find

00:58:22,589 --> 00:58:28,440
your error and once you've got your ever

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:30,030
then you can actually lick very

00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,680
carefully that's what's going on so you

00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:37,470
can find what the actual issue is and

00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,520
when you find easy you it's a bit

00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:40,250
annoying because it will it will

00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,170
actually show you something very

00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:46,079
explicit it will say to which file it is

00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:47,550
opening and if it's something like a not

00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,579
a normal fire if it's a file that

00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:52,470
shouldn't be opened you will understand

00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:57,780
that that was the issue and therefore

00:58:52,470 --> 00:59:01,380
you can just fix that issue and and get

00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:03,869
back to work basically so yeah so as

00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:06,720
trace you should use it because it's

00:59:03,869 --> 00:59:11,180
very key to understanding well goes

00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,180
wrong in your programs thank

00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:44,450
also noticing after Peter atomic patch

00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:46,720
kofsky are you around excellent you will

00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,720
be next

01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:28,270
yeah two days ago Federico has had a

01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:31,960
tutorial about blender and there was a

01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:35,410
huge interest in this program and say

01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:40,090
also remains some questions one

01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:42,820
questions I will answer in short it is

01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:48,850
difficult to use blender in the first

01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:54,640
place like VI or emacs how many users

01:00:48,850 --> 01:01:01,000
use VI rise your hand okay and Xander as

01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:03,340
a party he makes users okay you know you

01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,980
remember this difficulties the same

01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:13,360
happens with blender and i will give you

01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:16,810
a short inside that I like so off often

01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:21,120
the windows are splitted by accident and

01:01:16,810 --> 01:01:26,440
this happens when you come with mouse

01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:29,050
over this tree angle and there is no

01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:34,810
closing button like none other windows

01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:40,770
and it's if you know it's really easy go

01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:46,390
to the same point the triangle and drag

01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:54,390
the pointer to this window that you want

01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:58,000
to close and you get rid of this windows

01:01:54,390 --> 01:02:03,490
this it's not possible if you try to

01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:07,480
close this window on the right side they

01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:18,099
have to be the same have to have the

01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:20,859
same size and another feature is

01:02:18,099 --> 01:02:26,979
to switch from this Windows you can have

01:02:20,859 --> 01:02:32,410
many windows in this program to the full

01:02:26,979 --> 01:02:38,470
window with control error and you can go

01:02:32,410 --> 01:02:42,579
back to the window overview you have to

01:02:38,470 --> 01:02:47,549
control this the mouse pointer where it

01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:52,049
is placed to get to the right window

01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:57,160
using a blender in pi mu Friday a

01:02:52,049 --> 01:03:01,539
project to teach children to learn Tyson

01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:12,809
and i will show you some examples in the

01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:19,930
end this is some example for generating

01:03:12,809 --> 01:03:25,239
molecules joven has assisted me this is

01:03:19,930 --> 01:03:35,309
knowledge as a Amos twist and you can

01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:35,309
run a script was very small its sister

01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:48,990
this I'll pee or run script and in the

01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:53,940
dry debut you can watch your your

01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:58,960
objects I have prepared here five

01:03:53,940 --> 01:04:03,730
objects let's do this is a water

01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:10,330
molecule let's try a DNR or a part of

01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:20,130
the DNR nama talked to in my list run

01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:20,130
again this takes some seconds

01:04:24,910 --> 01:04:32,640
and there is a DNR and you can watch

01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:37,110
your objects and this is an example for

01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:40,930
teachers for chemistry and we like to

01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:46,260
create more such examples and you can

01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:51,690
join us at the sprint on Friday name

01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:51,690
tuesday-saturday okay that's all thanks

01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:05,450
all right so it looks like Sebastian

01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:08,890
assorted out of a screen atomic your

01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:08,890
that's you right all right

01:05:48,290 --> 01:05:53,250
okay start my name is Sebastian Griffin

01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:55,110
I'm presenting get lint a tool for

01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:58,040
improving the source code one step at a

01:05:55,110 --> 01:06:02,310
time and let's start with a quick demo

01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:04,380
so let's say you have a an existing code

01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:06,960
base and you want to start enforcing a

01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:12,750
strict arrow like a new coding standard

01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:14,520
and so by like modifying and fixing all

01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:17,220
the pre existing code it's like

01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:20,610
impossible and it doesn't make much

01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:22,410
sense so instead I present this to to to

01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:25,980
make these changes incrementally so

01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:29,400
let's say I have like this a small

01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:31,590
commit I modify the decimal module in

01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:36,000
the standard library and I also i did a

01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:39,120
new icon so typically developers would

01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:42,180
run Pepe tour pilot whatever standard

01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:50,550
you defined so let's see what pile in

01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:53,370
says about this module there are like

01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:56,640
eight hundred of like these messages and

01:06:53,370 --> 01:07:00,030
like the situation doesn't improve when

01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:02,190
you when you rant / paid you have like

01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:06,120
hundred and eighty messages so if you

01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:08,430
modify a line and all like possible a

01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:09,840
problems these tools are going to find

01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:13,220
our probably going to beat shadow bar

01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:17,730
the pre-existing error so let's see how

01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:20,340
my change looks like so I only modify

01:07:17,730 --> 01:07:23,670
one line with a pretty pretty obvious

01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:25,440
like a spacing error and finding the

01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:30,330
other were in that amount of code it's

01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:35,490
virtually impossible so let's see what

01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:38,340
the tool says so here like we really can

01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:40,710
see really easily like first the output

01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:43,380
of piling and second the output of pep

01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:47,220
ate both complaining about the extra the

01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:49,440
lacking space and also we have a gear

01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,860
poop for like the pinky these two tools

01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,320
are saying that we can loss

01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:55,570
lost Leslie compress the this file like

01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:59,920
for like thirty percent with the second

01:07:55,570 --> 01:08:14,730
tool so let's fix this a these problems

01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:18,760
and GG ok so i optimize the PG and also

01:08:14,730 --> 01:08:26,080
fix the Python file so let's try to

01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:29,830
commit so it's running the pre-commit

01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:38,170
hook link in the the big file silent

01:08:29,830 --> 01:08:48,220
takes awhile so let's wait eventually

01:08:38,170 --> 01:08:51,220
it's gonna finish hopefully okay yeah

01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:52,810
that's okay and for the second icon is

01:08:51,220 --> 01:08:55,570
you complaining because the other tool

01:08:52,810 --> 01:09:00,190
still can like shrink the file by four

01:08:55,570 --> 01:09:02,140
percent and and you still can commit it

01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:09,550
if you like skip the pre-commit hook and

01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:11,860
let's go back to the n so this tool like

01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:14,290
run many winters report error only on

01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:16,630
the modified lines and modified files it

01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:18,370
catches the results so when pilings is

01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:19,630
really slow like you run it again and

01:09:18,370 --> 01:09:22,210
you're going to get the results right

01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:24,820
away reorder with the resource file a

01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:27,670
nano and also like normalized message of

01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:30,130
different tools like you know and in a

01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:32,200
uniform way it's quite extensible it

01:09:30,130 --> 01:09:34,390
comes with a pre hook and it's

01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:37,270
really easy to integrate with a review

01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:40,090
tooth and it comes with support for

01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:44,950
Python Java PHP Robbie a javascript HTML

01:09:40,090 --> 01:09:48,490
CSS SCSS jpg PNG rest Jason Jamel in E

01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:52,000
and if you want to use it go pip install

01:09:48,490 --> 01:09:55,840
get link or go to my heel cup and if you

01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,730
are using mercurial and you want to

01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:01,330
support it it should be released it's

01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:04,620
just module exposing some common access

01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:04,620
to the underlying data

01:10:14,850 --> 01:10:30,610
so next one is tonic right yeah and then

01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:32,800
hola hola next one okay hi I'm here

01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:37,900
today to represent a small group of

01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:43,530
friends so who are we you might know us

01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:48,280
as a team behind Django con Europe 2013

01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:50,110
also known as Django circus it was a

01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:53,770
conference held in a circus tent on a

01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:58,420
horse race truck it had different feel

01:10:53,770 --> 01:11:02,080
we had hammocks deck chairs and very

01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:05,350
relaxed atmosphere it felt almost like a

01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:09,280
music festival and we liked it we liked

01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:12,520
it really really very much then

01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,980
sometimes later makrand happened it was

01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:17,170
an awesome event with robots quadcopters

01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:22,510
and everyday objects connected to the

01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:24,850
internet people had fun so did we part

01:11:22,510 --> 01:11:27,760
of our team organized Django girls and

01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:31,210
you will hear about this later this

01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:34,270
event also had was full of good feelings

01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:40,510
and relaxed atmosphere although it was

01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:43,600
very busy recently we had an idea a very

01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:46,620
nice idea it bloomed in era in our minds

01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:49,210
kind of concurrently let's have

01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:52,960
conference that's even more about people

01:11:49,210 --> 01:11:56,680
even more about you let's go to a place

01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:59,670
where people really stand out let's

01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:02,410
remove big city cars noises

01:11:59,670 --> 01:12:05,440
advertisements let's go to remote place

01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:09,730
natural and beautiful place and I know

01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:12,010
such a place I grew up there here's the

01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:13,989
deal it will be smaller much more

01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:15,570
intimate event focused on getting to

01:12:13,989 --> 01:12:19,270
know each other and sharing knowledge

01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:21,670
will have campfire story stories hiking

01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:24,400
and kayaking will have relaxed

01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:25,900
atmosphere much more focus on hallway or

01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,570
campfire track

01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:33,190
all of this will happen in summer of

01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:35,620
2015 in beer strada Poland and some say

01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:38,020
this is the most beautiful part of

01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:43,630
Europe although I might be I might be

01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:45,820
biased so think about it as a weekend

01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:49,150
gate get away in the mountains with your

01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:51,550
favorite Python people if that sounds

01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:54,940
interesting go to this website and

01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:59,290
subscribe to our newsletter or follow us

01:12:54,940 --> 01:13:01,120
on Twitter so Python passed a summer

01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:03,420
camp for Python people I hope to see

01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,420
there

01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:30,920
after all enola there will be a much a

01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:33,260
great car that's you get ready yeah hi

01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:36,170
there you probably don't see us but yeah

01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:39,440
we are too short but we are ola in Tola

01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:41,840
and we found we are funders of jungle

01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:44,290
girls we did our first workshop on

01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:47,770
Monday and we want to share our

01:13:44,290 --> 01:13:50,900
experiences and what we have learned

01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:52,760
okay so what's jungle girls to put it

01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,440
very simply it's a one day workshop for

01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:56,540
women who want to learn about technology

01:13:54,440 --> 01:13:59,120
start programming in python and django

01:13:56,540 --> 01:14:01,040
and maybe even become professional

01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,380
programmers we want to see more woman

01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:06,170
here at arrow python so I've decided to

01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:12,080
dedicate lots of our free time to have

01:14:06,170 --> 01:14:16,940
this cause okay so some statistics we

01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:21,200
had more than 300 applications from 33

01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:23,840
countries so we see that there is a big

01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:26,690
demand of this kind of events and we're

01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:29,570
really really depressed to reject a lot

01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:35,420
of them we basically planned for 19

01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:37,490
women but we grew to 45 overnight yeah

01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:40,490
and it was really awesome people were so

01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:43,490
motivated they spent 11 hours on Monday

01:14:40,490 --> 01:14:46,010
a very intense programming most of them

01:14:43,490 --> 01:14:47,960
right the first line of Python at nine

01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:49,400
a.m. in the morning and by the end of

01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:51,830
the day they deployed their application

01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:53,270
to Heroku we're really really proud and

01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:55,280
actually quite surprised that they

01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:56,870
managed to do that because we expected

01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:00,740
that the tutorial can be a little too

01:14:56,870 --> 01:15:05,240
much for just one day so yeah yeah okay

01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:08,210
so tutorial we started with looking at

01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:10,670
the internet and for existing tutorial

01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:12,740
but we couldn't find the perfect fit for

01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:17,050
us so of course we decided well let's

01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:21,969
write our own tutorial so we did and

01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:25,690
it is on tutorial.org ours dot org it's

01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:29,020
open source is on gate so you can we

01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:30,880
accept full requested pull requests and

01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:33,969
of course we are still polishing that

01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:37,540
and try to fix the bugs we discovered on

01:15:33,969 --> 01:15:40,270
Monday and yeah so we have a lot of

01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:44,349
stuff covered their their installation

01:15:40,270 --> 01:15:47,530
of python django postgres we use virtual

01:15:44,349 --> 01:15:51,099
and we go through python django models

01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:56,199
that main viewer or URLs or templates

01:15:51,099 --> 01:15:58,290
forms HTML CSS select a lot of stuff we

01:15:56,199 --> 01:16:04,469
have quite cool setup so we start with

01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:08,409
yeah python 3.4 django 1.6 and postgres

01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:10,420
we had some troubles we thought that the

01:16:08,409 --> 01:16:16,540
most problematic will be windows but

01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:19,809
you're going to is a course so we are

01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:21,790
super free to say that on monday 35 new

01:16:19,809 --> 01:16:24,059
female programmers joined our Python

01:16:21,790 --> 01:16:24,059
community

01:16:32,030 --> 01:16:37,520
of course all this would be possible

01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:40,010
without the help from these awesome

01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,900
people there are 15 of our coaches who

01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:43,450
spend their free time before during and

01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:45,830
after the workshop to make it all happen

01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:47,600
we also very grateful to the old

01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:49,100
sponsors thanks to them you're able to

01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,500
fans travel for some of our attendees

01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:53,300
and the team behind arup items was very

01:16:51,500 --> 01:16:56,900
generous and very helpful with

01:16:53,300 --> 01:17:01,220
organizing everything so perfectly yeah

01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:03,500
ok so here we are today in two weeks

01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:07,070
there is next jungle girls chapter in

01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:09,740
pike on Australia thanks to amazing

01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:13,880
Alana Williams and then there will be

01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:17,540
jungle girls Argentina but we don't want

01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:19,520
to stop here and when we were choosing

01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:23,030
attendees for the water workshops we

01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:26,140
wanted to find people who are not only

01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:30,920
one who want not only educate themselves

01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:32,900
but who are also motivated leaders women

01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:36,350
who will go back to their hometowns and

01:17:32,900 --> 01:17:38,630
do something good for the community so

01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:41,330
that's why we hope that next year we

01:17:38,630 --> 01:17:43,670
will have many many many more jungle

01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:46,010
girls happening on a regular basis all

01:17:43,670 --> 01:17:49,190
over the world and of course you can

01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:51,770
help us make happen so become a couch

01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:53,810
organizers volunteer sponsor proofreader

01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:56,780
or support or even like help us spread

01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:58,670
the word and spark the change visit our

01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:02,470
website or email so just drop us a line

01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,470
and let's talk thank

01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:20,290
we're running out of time for the

01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:21,640
remainder of the lightning talks I'm

01:18:20,290 --> 01:18:24,220
going to add one more and I'm going to

01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:28,420
pull one up because it's about your

01:18:24,220 --> 01:18:31,780
Python and even though I told them I

01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:34,240
would not i will give them the last slot

01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:36,670
Mike Miller and Fabio are you wrong Mike

01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:40,600
I see you Fabio excellent can come

01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:42,190
forward yesterday we managed to get

01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,670
through everything I think even before

01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:48,130
time today we have a few that we

01:18:45,670 --> 01:18:50,110
couldn't get to everybody who wants to

01:18:48,130 --> 01:18:52,630
get the chance to slip into the first

01:18:50,110 --> 01:18:54,340
spots tomorrow before we open up come to

01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:58,540
me and then I can transfer you to the

01:18:54,340 --> 01:19:01,480
next list alright so machi thanks so

01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:04,900
it's like a Polish combo in the end but

01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:07,720
I can't hope to top Ola Ola and I wanted

01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:11,560
to shortly show you in compadre which is

01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:14,020
something I'm working on and just just a

01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,150
disclaimer I it's still very

01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:18,550
embarrassing states that the app is in

01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:20,290
but obviously that's a great reason to

01:19:18,550 --> 01:19:24,730
show it to a huge audience of critical

01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:28,300
developers so I'm still trying to finish

01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:31,930
my PhD I did it at UCL in London and it

01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:33,700
was in computer vision and after

01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:36,460
developing some image processing

01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:40,690
algorithms tend to be perceptually nice

01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:43,180
and I had this problem and to to imagine

01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:45,300
it just imagine for a second unlike me

01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:49,630
your serious research are trying to

01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:52,390
contribute to the good of humanity by

01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:56,710
creating real important state of the art

01:19:52,390 --> 01:20:01,060
photo filter to make cat selfies more

01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:03,730
attractive so you have this new amazing

01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:05,290
algorithm but how do you figure out what

01:20:03,730 --> 01:20:07,570
it's actually good or not you can't

01:20:05,290 --> 01:20:09,940
actually quantify it easily because it's

01:20:07,570 --> 01:20:12,250
all about perception so what you have to

01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:16,840
do is run a user study and if you're

01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:19,900
like ordinary CS researcher you gently

01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:21,280
encourage your CS undergrads to be your

01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:23,440
test subjects

01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:26,409
you take 15 of them ask them what they

01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:28,929
think and then you publish or maybe you

01:20:26,409 --> 01:20:30,820
write a Java applets or if you really

01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:33,849
avant-garde pH before application

01:20:30,820 --> 01:20:37,539
running on your Windows XP laptop on

01:20:33,849 --> 01:20:39,219
your desk and make it online but I

01:20:37,539 --> 01:20:42,280
really want to make it easy to do the

01:20:39,219 --> 01:20:44,079
right thing and the right thing in the

01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:46,030
ideal world would be to for the

01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:46,929
researcher to first of all figure out

01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:49,150
what they want to find out which is

01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:51,429
obviously the difficult part but then

01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:53,739
once they have this just to upload the

01:20:51,429 --> 01:20:57,730
data run their studies get the reports

01:20:53,739 --> 01:21:00,760
and be able to publish and some party

01:20:57,730 --> 01:21:02,530
there it's a it's a jungle up it's

01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,139
integrated Mechanical Turk you can

01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:08,409
already asked people what they think and

01:21:04,139 --> 01:21:13,690
two papers are submitted using the

01:21:08,409 --> 01:21:15,039
system a but on the dais so a while ago

01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:16,780
i thought okay i figured out image

01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:18,849
processing and some base and starts and

01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:21,730
i even figure out how to write CSS so

01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:24,369
how hard can it be to make a usable

01:21:21,730 --> 01:21:27,099
application and then this happens

01:21:24,369 --> 01:21:30,489
there's like 300 full fields on a page

01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:32,050
and thousands of options and i can use

01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:36,849
it but I think I'm probably the only one

01:21:32,050 --> 01:21:39,760
and so yeah I just wanted to show this

01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:41,710
to you hopefully you tell me afterwards

01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:44,619
what you think about it if you are a

01:21:41,710 --> 01:21:46,170
person that rocks as user experience or

01:21:44,619 --> 01:21:50,530
know somebody who would like to help out

01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:51,880
please let me know and and yeah this

01:21:50,530 --> 01:21:56,110
isn't even the worst part you should see

01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:57,309
the documentation but yeah I'm really

01:21:56,110 --> 01:22:00,190
curious what you think about it so

01:21:57,309 --> 01:22:03,239
either please grab me afterwards or just

01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:03,239
write me no thank you

01:22:13,739 --> 01:22:24,239
last letting talk when I'm pretty much

01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:27,729
exactly on 530 on 700 hours only 7 p.m.

01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:29,289
the dinner will start as far as i know

01:22:27,729 --> 01:22:31,840
the organizers would like to have a

01:22:29,289 --> 01:22:33,820
little bit of room in the building to be

01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:38,139
a prepare everything and i think they

01:22:33,820 --> 01:22:42,099
want you out of here can anybody

01:22:38,139 --> 01:22:48,729
contradict me or confirm me okay that

01:22:42,099 --> 01:22:50,709
means that I'm confirmed by absence yeah

01:22:48,729 --> 01:22:53,440
Christian says himself don't and I know

01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:59,309
that guy for 30 years so if he wants us

01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:59,309
out then we better go out that's wrong

01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:07,619
try to just distinguisher show you

01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,619
something

01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:26,150
uh Norton big family boss okay all right

01:23:23,659 --> 01:23:29,690
okay you ready try to go to be managed

01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:31,820
so Thea student Europe has in 2014

01:23:29,690 --> 01:23:34,789
people and how they keep asking me about

01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:37,820
Europe eyes in 2015 and this is very

01:23:34,789 --> 01:23:39,969
short lightning talk is about and we

01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:42,320
have to go back in a bit of history and

01:23:39,969 --> 01:23:44,659
just when it's very condensed version

01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:46,820
what happened in the past so far that

01:23:44,659 --> 01:23:48,860
might be necessary to understand what

01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:52,940
they're talking about here so last year

01:23:48,860 --> 01:23:55,159
at Florence our proposal the German

01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:56,449
group building group applied for your

01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:59,150
pies in two thousand fourteen and

01:23:56,449 --> 01:24:03,170
fifteen and was accepted last year at

01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:04,969
Florence that's so far and then a few

01:24:03,170 --> 01:24:07,789
things happens in between we will talk

01:24:04,969 --> 01:24:11,809
about quickly though in december two

01:24:07,789 --> 01:24:14,809
thousand thirteen the aps took this your

01:24:11,809 --> 01:24:16,639
person 2015 thing away from from the

01:24:14,809 --> 01:24:19,880
Berlin people for some reasons we will

01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:23,210
explain soon and then they announced in

01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:26,840
January your present fabulous here Nucor

01:24:23,210 --> 01:24:28,789
for Europe is in 15 and also the per

01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:31,579
billion people they are invited to apply

01:24:28,789 --> 01:24:36,530
for the conference and the reasons will

01:24:31,579 --> 01:24:39,949
be explained soon and just the main

01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:41,659
reason actually you don't have much time

01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:44,210
to go in a lot of details here that will

01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:46,400
be a session tomorrow between four and

01:24:44,210 --> 01:24:49,400
five-thirty there will be three talks

01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:52,070
and discussions about this topic at the

01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:54,019
room b 09 who is interested please come

01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:56,300
there and the main reason actually is a

01:24:54,019 --> 01:24:58,489
different approach in how to organize

01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:02,449
circumference though that's a kind of

01:24:58,489 --> 01:25:03,800
the main picture about it and as I said

01:25:02,449 --> 01:25:06,769
the lightning talk is not the right

01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:10,340
place to take go into more detail that's

01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:13,480
why the sessions for tomorrow and now I

01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:16,219
would like him to over 22 favio he's a

01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:18,920
chairman of the European society he will

01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:23,980
say something more about this call I

01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:26,780
just mentioned so hi everybody

01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:30,110
yes we are running a call for

01:25:26,780 --> 01:25:32,240
participation for 2015 as all right Mike

01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:40,520
already said we highly encourage the

01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:42,770
Burlington to apply and help us we they

01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:47,210
organized this conference and its really

01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:49,310
it's running really well many details

01:25:47,210 --> 01:25:52,820
will be given tomorrow things just

01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:55,850
didn't work as as expected from an

01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:58,910
organization point of view and this this

01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:00,770
is from a new Python society point of

01:25:58,910 --> 01:26:04,540
view this is what this was a huge life

01:26:00,770 --> 01:26:09,250
lesson for us this new organization

01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:12,380
board is quite young and this made us

01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:16,310
really understand that the conference is

01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:19,370
getting very big and it's really hard to

01:26:16,310 --> 01:26:21,440
actually maintain the same kind of

01:26:19,370 --> 01:26:24,530
conference the same kind of services and

01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:27,380
and everything and in in a status that

01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:30,520
the community itself can keep moving the

01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:34,870
conference so I've seen many social

01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:37,640
events being organized around by local

01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:40,670
organizers and there's there's much

01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:44,360
effort to actually improve the community

01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:48,080
and if you are interested in getting

01:26:44,360 --> 01:26:50,900
part of that our vision is that the

01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:55,280
conference should change the conference

01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:59,240
as a whole environment and the community

01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:01,910
should be more active to keep the

01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:04,880
conference running and we really need

01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:07,210
your help we need your help to build a

01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:10,010
different blood we would like to

01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:15,170
introduce a new concept of open

01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:18,320
workgroups so the PS we would like to

01:27:15,170 --> 01:27:23,420
change the concept of DPS as an

01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:25,310
organization with just one board we

01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:29,990
would like that to be as flat as

01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:32,420
possible and to have all everybody from

01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:35,270
the community working inside open teams

01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:36,600
that one will not change every two years

01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:39,120
and for that

01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:41,580
