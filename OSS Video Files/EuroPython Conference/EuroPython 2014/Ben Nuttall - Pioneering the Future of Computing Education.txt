	Ben Nuttall - Pioneering the Future of Computing Education
[EuroPython 2014]
[24 July 2014]

How the Raspberry Pi Foundation are leading the way in the computing in schools revolution by providing affordable open and connectable hardware to people of all levels of experience.
Now we have an education team, we're pushing forward with creating resources and training teachers to help deliver modern computing education around the world.
All our learning resources are Creative Commons licensed and available on GitHub. We write materials that match the UK computing curriculum.

-----

I'm Ben, from Raspberry Pi. I do development and outreach for the Foundation and I work with the rest of the education team to help make learning through computer science, coding and hardware hacking more accessible to all.

In this talk I explain the Raspberry Pi story: its mission - the reason the Pi exists; what happened before release - getting the board in to production; what happened in the first two years - the community birth and growth; and what's coming next - education focus, new hardware and improved software.

Python is the main language used (and advocated by us) in education with Raspberry Pi.

We're creating learning resources to match up with the new UK computing curriculum, where we teach young people programming and computer science concepts with Python on Pi, and help teachers deliver quality material in the classroom to work towards the objectives the curriculum sets out to achieve.

With Raspberry Pi we open up possibilities for connecting to the real world in an accessible way using the powerful, high level and human read/write -able language of Python.

We work closely with the community: hobbyists organising Raspberry Jam events; educators teaching with Raspberry Pi; the software communities and their contributions - and we welcome any interested parties to get involved with helping us provide for the wider community.

	00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,860
okay welcome back to the next talk

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,170
pioneering the future of computing

00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:33,420
education and please welcome from the

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:34,950
raspberry pi foundation then not all hi

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,360
everyone thanks for coming to the talk I

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,050
hope you are enjoying your Python as

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,489
much as I am as great to be here so I'm

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,579
from the raspberry pi foundation when I

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,250
bend not all I am Abid developer and I

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:49,170
work in on the education team as well so

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,960
I am responsible for the website the

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,260
reply website I do other development

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,640
work on writing educational material and

00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,570
Anna do outreach and talks and things

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,580
like that so what is raspberry price

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,880
I've got one here so it's a single board

00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,150
computer that runs linux from an SD card

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,950
it has USB ports and hdmi the idea is

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,890
you just plug it into your TV plug in a

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,350
mouse and keyboard and program and you

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,859
can use it as a normal desktop computer

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,479
to a certain extent so why was reply so

00:01:19,859 --> 00:01:25,170
why did they why did they come up with

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,890
this device the thing is this is a BBC

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,639
microcomputer and the idea of this was

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,840
that you would plug it into your TV and

00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:35,729
you would get programming environment

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,389
straight away that's exactly what the

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,460
Raspberry Pi was supposed to be so the

00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:43,259
thing is we used to have computers like

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,420
that that you could program now have

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,030
computers like this that you can just

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,819
you just it's just a magic box and it

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,389
just works you wave your hands around

00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:57,060
and things happen that's making you

00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:58,979
stupid as great as that that is the

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,079
technology we're not learning how to

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,350
make these things we're just learning

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,389
how to use them so the raspberry pi is a

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,729
foundation it's a charity UK charity as

00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:11,970
a board of trustees that manage its

00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,890
direction and there are two sides of it

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,750
like any like most charities they kind

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,130
of split into two at some point there's

00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,080
a trading company so that's the

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,370
engineers is rubble run by eben Upton

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,490
that's a that's a bunch of people who

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,050
bring in money they make money they give

00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,040
it to us and we spend it I'm on the

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:34,230
foundation side

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,989
the fun side so yeah we hire ex teachers

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:40,859
we hire developers who want to work on

00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:42,120
the educational material and as I say we

00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:47,099
spend the money that the engineer's

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:51,510
bring in so this is the foundation in it

00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,640
was set up in 2009 by a group of people

00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,310
at Cambridge University they were trying

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,469
to essentially make a modern-day BBC

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,230
micro something you just plug in and you

00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:02,819
would get it was going to be originally

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,879
just going to be a Python prompt at the

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,459
boot so you plug into your TV you have a

00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,169
Python prompt you have a keyboard you

00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,260
would just just be learning programming

00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,609
in a basic environment and as you can

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,230
see there's a few examples of the

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:20,340
prototypes there the one on the right

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:25,680
here that was a almost like a USB stick

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:28,169
select size device that was just USB one

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,609
side hdmi the other side and it was just

00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,200
going to be a programming environment

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,329
with Python the one in the middle of

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,299
ebony so holding was a sort of prototype

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,739
of a whole single board computer which

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,590
eventually became the one on the right

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:45,780
there which is the the original

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:49,680
raspberry pi model b and and in that

00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,000
time the the entire foundation's mission

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
was just to get the board into

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,489
production make it a reality and then

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,650
from 2012 to the beginning of 2012 when

00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:01,340
the raspberry pi went on sale and they

00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,810
had 10,000 raspberry PI's waiting to be

00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,319
waiting to be bought and they sold

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:10,199
100,000 on the first day so it was a

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,449
little bit more there's a lot more

00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,939
interest than was anticipated and that

00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:16,500
was just from having a wordpress blog

00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,419
saying yeah we're going to make this

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,060
cool thing it's going to do python and

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,500
i'll teach kids code and a lot of people

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,199
saying hey this is really cool they're

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,650
going to make a $35 computer i want one

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,330
of those and they all try to get one i

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,539
was there at that time trying to to

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:37,590
order as we pie on the on the 20-29 in

00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:40,919
February the leap day year in 2012 and

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,660
so we had Evan going around in this

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,750
first of year

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,950
ye are to going around giving talks

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:51,510
telling people about about what

00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,950
Raspberry Pi was about we have Liz who

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,970
was managing the blog and Twitter and

00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,980
doing a great job of promoting

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:59,700
everything we were we were trying to do

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:03,900
at the time we we announced the new the

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,850
new model which was an anticipated new

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,360
development the model a so that was the

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,190
cheaper less powerful version of the

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,650
original Raspberry Pi so it just is just

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:16,410
the same with only one USB and without

00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:19,290
air for that we had Clive bill join the

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,600
team his the guy only on the end here he

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:22,980
sort of formed the first sort of

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,470
iteration of the the founder

00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,330
foundations-educational team he went

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,180
around giving talks about how you can

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:35,190
use rose reply in school we had some

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:37,110
funding from google who wanted to push

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:40,020
these devices into schools around the UK

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,430
and where we have a whole load of those

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,070
that were we've been giving out to

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:47,460
schools we also brought out a the first

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:49,140
official product to add on product for

00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,850
their eyes replied the camera module and

00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,410
then there was a second iteration of

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,580
that which with the infrared filter

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,640
removed the camera the pi noir as that

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:04,950
was something people were asking for and

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:07,230
then also in i think it was late 2012 we

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:09,900
moved production of raspberry PI's from

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,340
China to the UK so we're really kind of

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,680
proud to be able to say all the

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,470
raspberry PI's you buy now are made it

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:23,430
in one factory one sony factory in wales

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:25,530
in the UK and and then after after the

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,060
raspberry pi became available and it was

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,040
out there in the wild this whole

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,919
community just came out of nowhere that

00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:34,080
is a real kind of amalgamation of

00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,669
everything from the existing hackers who

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,350
were already used to these kind of death

00:06:35,669 --> 00:06:39,660
boards but paying a lot more money for

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,520
them people like myself who were

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,750
programmers and attending user groups

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,140
and really interested in the tech

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,880
community that way and a whole host of

00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,640
people in between and there was all

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,380
these new kids parents teachers or

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,750
trying to get involved in what Raspberry

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,100
Pi was about all these books and

00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,260
magazines starts sprout

00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:01,380
loads of things on Kickstarter trying to

00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:02,730
further it loads of add-on boards people

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,170
were doing robotics and all sorts of

00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,720
things and there were all these other

00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,700
all these people out there just making

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,010
things with raspberry pi and our blog

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,720
was was just full of these amazing

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,430
projects there were there's a guy

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,480
sending them into space to take pictures

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,700
of the earth as you can see they're

00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,470
absolutely amazing i definitely

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,720
recommend you going check his stuff out

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,840
he's called dave acreman if you search

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,240
for high in the sky you'll find a lot of

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,650
cool stuff there's a load of this is

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,300
just an example a load of robotics

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,790
projects and all sorts of things people

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:36,210
people were doing with raspberry PI's

00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:38,160
early on so then in from 2014 onwards

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,140
this is the point where okay we've sold

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,480
an awful lot of these things we've got a

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,890
lot of money coming in we did they'd

00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,830
originally said they weren't we weren't

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:47,820
going to do some of teacher training and

00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,690
education material we're going to leave

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,920
that to the community but you know we

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,900
got to a point where we're in a position

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:57,540
where we can actually do do a lot of

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,280
that so what we done so far this year so

00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,960
we brought out this this is the

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,320
industrial version of the Raspberry Pi

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,650
as the industrial compute module it's

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,290
it's a Raspberry Pi in the form factor

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,840
of a ram chip so it's a sodium connects

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,210
connector it slots into a dev board like

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,160
this and you use this as a prototype as

00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:21,590
your of your industrial project product

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:25,020
and that's a really really cheap and

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,550
very accessible dev board that you can

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,900
get there that will fund you know the

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,430
money comes in to us and we that will

00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,969
you be used to fund the educational

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:34,530
mission of the of the charity we hit a

00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:36,330
major milestone recently and we

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:40,650
announced three million sales raspberry

00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:43,860
PI's which is really cool and just last

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:45,780
week we announced the model B plus the

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,430
first upgrade till the second upgrade

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:52,020
should I say to the original Raspberry

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:55,440
Pi it's got extra USB ports extra GPIO

00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:58,290
pins and now has 40 it's got improved

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,020
power and power consumption so we'll use

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,840
less power and it term it deals with

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,930
with with that a lot more sensibly we

00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,630
move the composite for the for an analog

00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,580
TV on to the headphone jack so it's just

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,660
just there on the one side and it now

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,220
takes a micro SD card and the best thing

00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:25,470
about this is that the price is the same

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:27,090
it's a still $35 so most notably about

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,060
yeah sort of specifically related to

00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,100
this talk is that we formed an education

00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,950
team this year so I joined at the end of

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,530
2013 Clive was already there this is

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,580
carrie Ann carrion Philbin it was the

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,260
author of one of the books that I

00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,290
mentioned that the community brought out

00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:44,760
she's an ex-teacher as is Clive now

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,920
we've got a couple of other guys who are

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,750
in this you know the same makes a brat

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,090
girl once one was a teacher and other

00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,000
was a developer like myself and we're

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,730
coming together now and doing a lot of

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,410
things so we've got Pike Adam e which is

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,120
our teacher training course that we now

00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,400
run we do about one every month or two

00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:06,300
at the moment so we invite teachers to

00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,160
apply and it's free CPD for teachers and

00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,070
it's now open to teachers around the

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,350
world they come in for two days training

00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,550
of getting used to all the different

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:15,810
things you can do with raspberry Pi in

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,180
the classroom and helping them overcome

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,220
any problems they've had classroom

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,440
logistics that kind of thing and get

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,600
them introduced to it and in a nice kind

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,490
of way that they all realize they're in

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,080
the same boat and that they they can get

00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,460
over these problems and I was hard to

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,640
take on the website so previously we

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:38,220
just had a simple blog just showing the

00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,870
information of what people were doing

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,030
the raspberry PI's around the world all

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,190
the projects that we can find curated

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:47,060
that all on our blog which was fantastic

00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,350
in content but what we really needed was

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,510
was all the stuff this this new website

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,090
brought so we now have educational

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,130
resources on the website we have help

00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,340
guides all all that call it kind of

00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,830
thing in a more accessible way so this

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:04,830
is our resources page we have them in

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,600
three categories teach learn and make so

00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,160
there's things for teachers to take and

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,290
actually just give give them give give

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,540
classes based on this teaching computing

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,690
concepts and that kind of thing and they

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:21,980
have all the other stuff teachers need

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:26,130
to deliver the UK curriculum

00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:27,480
they have kind of learning objectives

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,310
and all the all the kind of things that

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,980
you know relates to the curriculum that

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,190
the teachers need learn are things like

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,200
just you know do do this exercise you

00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,210
know kind of learn learn about this this

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,070
topic and then make is kind of building

00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,830
things or or or making some sort of

00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:47,100
interactive application they're all free

00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:50,400
to use and in free in the in the liberty

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,050
sense so they're all Creative Commons

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,190
license so you can do whatever you like

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,710
with those we don't want to put any

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:57,480
restrictions on teachers to say they

00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,280
can't print them I can't photocopy them

00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,170
I can't edit them or or whatever they

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,000
want so we just they're all out there

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,600
you know for anyone to use for any

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,770
purpose and we encourage them to sort of

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,770
edit them and make make their own

00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:14,670
resources out of our materials they're

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:16,920
all on github so we have collaborators

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:19,110
working on them around the world who

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,240
file issues if they if they have any

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:23,850
problems with them they they can edit

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,200
them they can fork them and we're

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,950
encouraging teachers to get to get

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,930
involved in sharing in this way as well

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,170
so some of our resources just just by a

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:35,780
few examples we've got a new one that's

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:40,530
that's being worked on the moment is

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:44,040
using a Morse code tapper and we've got

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:45,840
a we've got a Python interface to typing

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,640
messages and using that with Morse code

00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,190
and you learn how to build up that

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:53,010
program and through a few steps of build

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,410
building it up and which will be

00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,650
releasing soon we've got a an infrared

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,990
bird box using the camera you are so you

00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:03,870
can actually have a wetter feed a video

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,670
feed going from from a bird box to you

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,590
know that's got an infrared sensor so

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:09,270
whenever whenever a bird comes in it

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,680
starts recording and you can get some

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,190
lit we've got some we've seen some of

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,780
the uses of that around there around the

00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:19,100
internet people we've set this up and

00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:23,070
made their own made their own bird box

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,750
we've got there's actually a pure python

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,730
interface to the camera as well which is

00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:30,570
written by a friend of mine in

00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:32,880
Manchester which is which is really nice

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,080
to use and a great a great example of a

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,690
community contribution

00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:43,150
and we've got a few resources based

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:45,420
around that such as the push button stop

00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:47,380
motion one so where you can set up a

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,520
physical button that will trigger the

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,960
camera and and you can make a stop

00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,270
motion animation with something like

00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,830
Lego so there's there's a whole resource

00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,390
around building that up and

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,460
understanding how the code works and

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,070
actually building the you know the sort

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,310
of product for for making that that

00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,230
resource happen one of the we had a

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,480
poster competition at the end of last

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,010
year people kids sent in posters of

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,270
ideas that things they wanted to make

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,030
and we sent them one of the Google

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:19,360
Raspberry Pi kits in in return one of

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:21,340
the ideas was a hamster party cam they

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,160
wanted to this this young child wanted

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,360
to see what a hamster's did at night

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,520
she's saying they were they were

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,420
nocturnal said that they're probably you

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,570
know running around having a party so so

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,220
we made the resource based on her idea

00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:40,000
and showed you how you could set up a

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,470
camera to watch to watch the to be

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,910
triggered when that when the hamster

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:44,440
wheel went round or when the when the

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:47,290
when the hamster was walking around the

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,330
cage there's things like kress eggheads

00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:52,090
which is a time lapse of crest growing

00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:53,830
out of egg and then there's some actual

00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,060
sort of computer science stuff so

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,400
there's things like a networking

00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,100
resource we recently put together which

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,540
is a whole series of lessons based

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,040
around learning networking with a

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:06,460
raspberry pi which is a lot closer to

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,770
what a lot of you imagine that we you

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,840
know we should be doing and there's a

00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:13,650
program I'll on Raspberry Pi called

00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,160
sonic PI which is really interesting

00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:20,020
project it's it's actually writing music

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,090
in code so you can see there's an

00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,670
example here is it's actually based on

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:27,040
Ruby which is a nice step between a

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:28,480
visual programming like a varmint like

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,420
scratch where you just drag and drop the

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,740
blocks and building up to something

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,670
where you can do you have a lot more

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,830
power like Python because of Ruby's

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,620
syntax there's not as many brackets and

00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:44,070
it's not as

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,480
it's not as reliant upon you having the

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,280
indentation set up in the right way

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,310
things like that and this is a really

00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:54,840
nice way and it also allows you to and

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:58,070
to rather than a visual representation

00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:00,030
of your of your code it's an audible

00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,460
representation which is which is really

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,880
interactive and can be really good to

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:09,270
teach computer science proj a concept so

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,870
how can you help so if you're if you've

00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:14,550
gone in a code club or a or some sort of

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,230
something like an open tech school

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,690
something like that you can use our

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,390
materials I'd love to see them being

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:22,620
used if you have any contributions if

00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,670
you've written your own material so if

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,460
you for one of ours and and added to it

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:30,810
we'd love to have it come back to us

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,300
it'd be great to see some contributions

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,610
from from the community as well if

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,250
you've got a package in in debian or a

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,660
tip something like that just just check

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,460
it out and see if it so if it runs on

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,020
the Raspberry Pi if it would be if

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:45,000
there's something you could do to

00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:52,410
improve it that would be that would be

00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:54,540
great there's also a network of events

00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:55,830
around mostly around the UK and there's

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,690
a few around the world as well called

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:02,340
raspberry jam there's actually just one

00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:05,850
recently been set up in berlin by a

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,800
friend of mine so if you if you could

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:09,300
attend a raspberry jam just a you know

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,520
if you've got a project sure you know

00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,410
she'll show it off at the jam few if you

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,670
can have a help lend a hand sort of the

00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,920
teaching aspects because a lot of

00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,260
children parents go along and then they

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,750
need a bit of guidance and any kind of

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:25,680
help along that one of those jams would

00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:27,840
be really really useful and if you if

00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,780
you've done something with a pie you

00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:32,580
know an email me tell me about it and

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,260
come on talk to somebody or email the

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,520
foundation it be the greater it's always

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,560
great to hear what people are doing the

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,670
raspberry PI's i often find people are

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,130
quite quiet about these things and

00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:42,660
they'll be chatting somebody for ages

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:45,480
telling them all about what we're doing

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,880
and then they just say oh yeah I am yeah

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,800
I've got a Raspberry Pi I yeah I built a

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,270
killer robot with it it's sunny yeah

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,570
it's all right it's not about it sir or

00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:57,440
something like you know I

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:59,539
I set one up that you know helps feed

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,549
children in Africa and like what this is

00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:02,779
amazing yeah you know you need to you

00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,990
tell me about this we can put out our

00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:08,720
blog but another thing you can do to

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,039
help is just a buy raspberry pi and and

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,370
the compute module that will be um

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:15,220
they'll be really really helpful because

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,809
if you buy raspberry pi your funding our

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,250
educational mission which is which is a

00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:22,039
worldwide mission it's just not just

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:24,649
based in the UK you from the development

00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:27,320
of new hardware so a lot of hackers back

00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:28,879
in the in the original days before this

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,379
came out we're really excited about it

00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:32,059
and they you know they wanted a piece of

00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:34,490
the action they wanted to get hold of of

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:35,779
a Raspberry Pi and the more the more

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,820
that we can work on that the more

00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:40,309
engineers we have working on new

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:44,120
products the you know the the more

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:47,269
everyone else will benefit from that you

00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,100
know there's there's always work being

00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:52,250
done on on the current Raspberry Pi and

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,159
future products that you know there can

00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:58,669
be further by by our and our expansion

00:18:55,159 --> 00:19:00,529
and I'm sure you'd all love to see the

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:04,070
next generation of rubber as we pie and

00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:06,340
and we can you know we can we can make

00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:09,649
big big leaps forward in that respect

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,840
and you're also funding free and open

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:14,029
source software by by by buying

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,070
Raspberry Pi we we have a lot of

00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:20,000
contributions towards open source and

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:23,179
then so we we funded the port of pi PI

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,029
to 2 arm which if you saw the talk

00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:28,669
yesterday on pi PI that was that was

00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:30,320
mentioned there we funded XBMC to kind

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:34,240
of improve improve that on on our

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,320
hardware things like live AV pigs burn

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,600
Wayland and western were working really

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,179
hard on on that those kind of desktop

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,009
environments for that will work better

00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:45,009
on our hardware important getting those

00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:47,450
pauses and getting a we've got our own

00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:50,179
version of that work being worked on at

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,909
the moment called Maynard which is which

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:55,549
is looking really cool we've we've

00:19:52,909 --> 00:19:58,309
developed a lot in front of a lot of

00:19:55,549 --> 00:19:59,929
development of squeak the small talk vm

00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:02,600
which scratch runs in and actually

00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:05,680
scratch itself mit have moved on from

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:08,750
the original version of scratch

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,060
and have moved it to a flash environment

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,600
so where we stuck on the the old version

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,460
but we're actually funding development

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,130
on that itself and incorporating a lot

00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,840
of a lot of cool features that you can

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:25,190
do with raspberry Pi in that such as

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,380
gpio interaction and with funded WebKit

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,570
and epiphany is a new browser that we're

00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:32,990
we're working on which will be released

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:35,810
soon we also been kind of lobbying

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,910
broadcom the guys we who make the chip

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,020
that we use to open source their

00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,460
graphics drivers because that's

00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:43,760
something that a lot of people really

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,710
want to see we've had a few a few wins

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,620
with those over the over the last two or

00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:51,080
three years and earlier this year we we

00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:54,380
put out a ten-thousand-dollar bounty to

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,830
the first person to port some drivers

00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:00,050
that they that they open sourced to work

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,220
on the Raspberry Pi and that was one and

00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:05,720
that was that was quite a big big

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:07,730
announcement for us and just done before

00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,880
I finish I'm going to be doing a US tour

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,730
next year so if you're that I'd quite a

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,530
basement this map as a sort of vague

00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,910
anticipation of my route this is going

00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:18,830
to be from the beginning of August for

00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,890
the next for the further about two or

00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:24,260
three weeks I'm trying to stop at any

00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:26,750
any hack spaces or any communities or

00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:28,310
groups if anyone is in the US or knows

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,900
anyone in the US who who might be

00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:31,640
interested in hearing me speak or or

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,830
coming to visit them or anything like

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,930
that check out the Raspberry Pi website

00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:38,210
there's a there's a call for requests or

00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,820
come and come speak to me or or get in

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,440
touch as I say if you've got anything

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:45,260
you want to talk to me about I'm going

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,180
to be here afterwards but also by all

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,540
means send me an email take check out

00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,590
our our work on github and if you've got

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,960
any projects you want to tell me about

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:55,490
please do email me so feel free to take

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,690
a picture of that all I've got some

00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,170
cards at the front here if you want to

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:03,460
if you want to grab one as well so thank

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:03,460
you I will take

00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:17,759
okay cool um tears very nice project any

00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:22,709
questions Oh a lot we all have don't

00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:24,569
have too much time but hi I'm so you

00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:28,859
mentioned that you have ongoing

00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:31,889
development what's going to happen next

00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:34,199
with Roz peopie so I know that there was

00:22:31,889 --> 00:22:36,719
a BBC master and then they are keys and

00:22:34,199 --> 00:22:39,599
so on and so forth so what's what's the

00:22:36,719 --> 00:22:42,149
next thing in the pipeline the next cool

00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,349
piece of hardware and I realized that

00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:47,519
you're probably going to say I can't

00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:49,019
tell you i can tell you well we we only

00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,239
just brought out a new model so i

00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:54,179
wouldn't expect anything immediately but

00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:55,589
it's more of a long term a long term

00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:58,529
thing talking about I never did

00:22:55,589 --> 00:23:01,169
reference raspberry pi 2 in the blog

00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:03,049
post announcing the B+ but he you know

00:23:01,169 --> 00:23:05,849
we're not talking anything imminent

00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:08,729
they'll think there will be future

00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:12,029
revision but and the B+ is the is the

00:23:08,729 --> 00:23:14,669
final the final revision of the original

00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:16,739
Raspberry Pi so we won't be on you know

00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:18,089
the current set of hardware past this

00:23:16,739 --> 00:23:20,159
but this will be a very long term

00:23:18,089 --> 00:23:22,349
supported device because it's as I said

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,829
there are three million of the the

00:23:22,349 --> 00:23:28,139
current raspberry PI's out there and

00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:33,929
we've no interest on you know leaving

00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:38,869
anyone behind and what about

00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:41,879
compatibility we do 11 laptop my child

00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:45,119
one laptop per child so what do you mean

00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:47,389
by compatibility what what can be done

00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,799
in common with the whipped up okay

00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:52,829
project okay you mean in terms of the

00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:57,359
project so that was a really cool

00:23:52,829 --> 00:23:58,859
project which you know a lot of the the

00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,729
aims of that project were very similar

00:23:58,859 --> 00:24:04,499
to our own the Rose replies a lot more

00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:06,299
extensible in terms of what you what you

00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:07,859
can do with it with the with the

00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:11,699
physical hardware and the physical

00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:12,839
computing elements I'm not sure really

00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:15,749
what there is to be said about

00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:18,149
compatibility in terms of I don't know

00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:20,130
if there's a still a sort of team

00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:21,420
working on that project but

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:23,460
I don't know if you've got anything

00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:26,940
specific to say we could we I'd love to

00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:31,770
talk to you about it okay one more

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:34,290
question what sort of software comes

00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:36,990
bundled with the Raspberry Pi ok so our

00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,910
major our main supported distribution is

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:44,490
called raspbian which is a community

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:46,050
port of the farm debian and that's the

00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:48,360
one that we we generally support we do

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:50,280
have a piece of software which runs off

00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:52,830
the SD card and gives you a selection of

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,490
different operating systems but i'll

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,260
just talk about raspbian so it's it's a

00:24:56,490 --> 00:25:01,200
full-fledged linux distribution so you

00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,600
do get a full desktop environment a lot

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,160
of things are installed by default and a

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,380
lot what anything that's available in

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:10,350
debian and the debian archives on arm is

00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,950
supported generally but yeah by default

00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:17,160
you get a lot of plenty of programming

00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:19,320
languages you get Python Java Ruby

00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,430
things like that and a lot of packages

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:27,780
are available for through Python as well

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:29,670
scratch is bundled sonic PI that the

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:33,980
GPIO libraries for instance things like

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:36,270
that the camera the camera interface

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,820
basically anything you can get in debian

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:44,300
as well as it is available ok thank you

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,300
very much again

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,910
