	Constanze Kurz - One year of Snowden, what's next?
[EuroPython 2014]
[21 July 2014]

Since June 2013, disclosed by Edward Snowden, we learn more and more facts about American and British spiesâ€™ deep appetite for information, economic spying and the methods they use to collect data. They systematically tapped international communications on a scale that only few people could imagine. But what are the consequences for societies when they now know about the NSA metadata repository capable of taking in billions of "events" daily to collected and analyze? Is there a way to defend against an agency with a monstrous secret budget?

	00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:26,770
so welcome also from me we're going to

00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:28,660
listen to Constance Accords and for

00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,079
those of you who don't know Constanza

00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:35,140
she's a speaker for the cars

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,020
communication club they they are very

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:41,470
instrumental in Germany for many many

00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,440
things regarding data privacy and she

00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:46,480
has been expert witness to the

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,300
constitutional court that finally

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,149
stopped data retention first in Germany

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:54,149
and then later on in Europe so that's

00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,760
but she's also involved in many other

00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,950
legal struggles and she's going to talk

00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,320
about a bit about this and just one

00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,690
statement I'd like to give him regarding

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:17,320
that many of you probably know Lawrence

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,270
Lessig who said codons law right maybe

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,450
you heard of that what he meant by that

00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:26,080
is actually that programming determines

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:30,190
many things in our societies and I think

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,580
we've come to realize that loss and what

00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:35,830
governments do also influences very much

00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:37,990
what we can do with programming and how

00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,570
programming is actually used by the

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,270
government by secret services and that's

00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,940
kind of one of the topics that evolved

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,790
especially in the last year and again

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:53,970
Constanza has launched some actions I

00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:56,530
think so far in all of the court

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,229
struggled she's she's been involved at

00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,759
she had a one hundred percent success

00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,759
rate right

00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:12,890
so that was and I hope she continues

00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:15,540
with that and in other news she's also

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:18,380
she's also a co-writer of very

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:21,420
interesting books about the increasing

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,120
automation that we have in our societies

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,520
the german title is a bites fry which

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,890
means something like out of work like

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,510
automated away something like this and

00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:32,040
what we can expect in the next 10 years

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,000
but this is not the topic of a talk now

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:38,730
but also something she is doing and so

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,570
i'm very happy to have her and give the

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,570
keynote took on Spencer

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:58,250
yeah Thank You haga was very warm words

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,810
and you of course for the applause since

00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:04,570
I didn't even started thank you very

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:09,080
much uh yeah it's one year of Snowden

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:11,390
what's next and I guess I'm happy to be

00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,920
back in that building as you maybe know

00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,000
I've been here for quite some years

00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,890
because the hacker community had him the

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,870
really largest european congress here

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,470
for quite some years and so i'm happy to

00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:26,690
be back and speaking in front of another

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,270
tech community about the Snowden

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,710
revelations it's going to be a mixture

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:35,960
of course technical topics but also

00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,760
questions of legalese and of course

00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:41,060
political questions because after that

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,670
year of renovations and elevations will

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,210
go on of course we have to ask some

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:51,650
questions and we should show as a wider

00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:55,130
tech community that we care and that we

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:57,920
don't accept the way it is and that we

00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:02,360
try to change it and I will maybe in the

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:06,800
end of the keynote I have some ideas

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,440
what to do about it since June last year

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,530
we learn more more about American and

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,930
British and other spies d Peppa tied for

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,480
data and information and of course about

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,880
economics buying and about the

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,270
technology they used to collect data as

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,490
well as they are hacking skills because

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,320
they also pay a lot of hackers as we

00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,430
know now and we know that the spies

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,470
systematically tap international

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:38,950
communication on an industrial scale

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:41,870
that's what we know and the NSA and the

00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:44,840
GCHQ and the partner services and

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,310
contractors metadata repository is

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:53,540
capable of storing storing billions of

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:56,120
transactions and events daily so the

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:59,870
question is if their way to defend

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,720
against an agency like the NSA with a

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:05,890
monstrous budget

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,320
and we're 8,500 NSA contractors have

00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,010
access to the data thinking about

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:15,360
economics buying as we know now from the

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:18,220
Guardian and other papers r elevations

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,920
after more than one year of Snowden

00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,920
documents we have to conclude the

00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,520
Democratic oversight system failed at

00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:31,780
each level of oversight so then let's

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,810
see how to fix it actually and first we

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,630
need to analyze what's really going on

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:39,310
if we want to fix it of course and I

00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,960
want to talk a little bit about the

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:48,340
surveillance industry that happens to to

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:50,950
be nowadays there is a study of privacy

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,850
international a research study of

00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:57,220
surveillance companies that offer their

00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:59,860
products nowadays the study is a

00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,960
collection of what is being sold it's

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,850
also a categorization of the

00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:10,300
technologies and also an explanation of

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:14,410
what these technologies actually do can

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:19,479
do and cannot do and those companies as

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:22,360
you see here worldwide they are 338 they

00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,390
sell different kinds of technologies for

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:28,020
civilians like cell phone monitoring

00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:31,360
equipment interception equipment as in

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,210
hardware of course technologies for

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,100
internet monitoring spyware packages

00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:39,010
that allow users to take complete

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:45,190
control over the computers and mobile

00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:50,710
devices and they even buy sell spyware

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:53,169
packages for law enforcement mostly or

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,960
secret services that allow the user to

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:57,940
take access to all the data and even the

00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,979
camera microphone such as a status we

00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,010
have today it's really an industrial

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,500
complex and not only monitoring

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,930
filtering and censorship technologies

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,400
but also passive and offensive hacking

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:14,840
towards and privacy international we did

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,030
go to the marketplace

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:22,250
and to the fairs which are worldwide and

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,350
took a look at the marketing brochure

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,790
with those those companies earth we

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,660
should have that in mind if we think

00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,580
about the Snowden revelations because

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,919
there's a reason for that's buying

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,970
complex and the reason is simple simply

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,360
money and those companies usually do not

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,030
take human rights concerns into account

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,450
or think about the risk of misuse

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,190
meaning that their products are used to

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,530
target pro-democracy activists

00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:54,770
journalists or any political opposition

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:57,880
in regimes or as we know from the

00:07:54,770 --> 00:08:00,830
Snowden fights no in democracies because

00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:04,100
since those technologies in the last

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:07,220
decades were used in regimes only we now

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,130
know that they are used in democracies

00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,919
as well and the technical tools to

00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,289
defend against it should not only be

00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:19,789
used in regimes but also in democracies

00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:21,710
and in the rare case that they are

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:23,930
export restrictions because those

00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:27,560
companies mostly come from the Western

00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,300
sphere and if one of the companies can

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,099
get any approval to export the

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,560
surveillance product from one country

00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:36,529
then they simply do it from another

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,890
that's the way it works today so we have

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:42,020
on a political agenda the question to

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,339
ask about export regulations of those

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:51,260
technologies not only using it in our

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:54,770
democracies um as it is the same for the

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,990
secret services like NSA and gchq this

00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,480
surveillance industry effective

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,779
oversight or any form of accountability

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,000
to so we have a problem that comes

00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:08,620
together with those industrial

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,779
surveillance complex and secret services

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:15,320
but really the start of the Snowden year

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:18,560
at least on a worldwide scale was the

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,890
prism scandal the prism program what you

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,640
see here is a picture from orbit which

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:29,160
LaNasa took

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:35,230
and artificially you see the facebook

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:39,390
network plotted on on that photo and I

00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:42,790
guess since the prism program mostly I

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:46,150
used social network data and made some

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,160
videos and video chats and photos the

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,980
scandal really emerged because most

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,430
people felt that they have to care about

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,740
those prism program because everybody or

00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:00,730
at least most of the people in the

00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:05,560
western world are targeted by those mess

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:07,150
surveillance programs actually I want to

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,730
talk a little bit about the Pfizer

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:12,370
decision I come to that later but most

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:15,310
important for me is that that program

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:18,430
already started in 2007 so we have the

00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:22,590
situation that those secret services

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:25,180
have a social and communication graph

00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:26,740
from the whole Western world with the

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,730
history of some years what never

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:34,090
happened in history of mankind actually

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:39,100
they know the communication pattern of

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:41,880
everybody who uses that services and all

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,940
the companies who see there are

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,270
cooperating but they do not do this

00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:51,580
willingly at most but they are legally

00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,140
obliged to do so and that's why I want

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,840
to talk a little bit about the FISA the

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:58,660
Foreign foreign intelligence

00:10:54,840 --> 00:11:01,150
intelligence surveillance act because

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,770
that's kind of the problem which much of

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:08,400
course for those companies because this

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:15,040
Snowden year is also really a trust

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:17,500
crises in not only between the state and

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:23,050
the secret services but also in the

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:25,840
rearm officer companies um this

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:29,620
worldwide attention to the NSA program

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:34,090
in the beginning it was NSA and FBI and

00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,860
CIA and not not the British GCHQ Senate

00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,059
on june six last year's you maybe

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:40,449
remember

00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:41,829
glenn windward and even McCaskill for

00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:44,499
the Guardian and Barton Gellman and

00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:48,399
Laura Poitras for the Washington Post

00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:50,049
reported on US domestic collection of

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,509
foreign Internet related data and I

00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:56,709
quote from a Washington Post from this

00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:59,679
june six the National Security Agency

00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:03,369
and the FBI are tapping directly into

00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:06,839
the central service of nine US Internet

00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:09,479
companies extracting audio video chats

00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,609
photographs emails document and

00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:15,099
connection logs that enable analysts to

00:12:12,609 --> 00:12:20,109
track foreign targets so it was really

00:12:15,099 --> 00:12:23,819
that's why I quoted this from the lost

00:12:20,109 --> 00:12:27,519
perspective it was really intended to

00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:30,189
target US citizen they had not intended

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,409
to target you a citizen but as as in

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:36,669
European and everybody else who is not

00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:39,279
US citizen or on US soil and so the

00:12:36,669 --> 00:12:41,529
discussion on a political basis today in

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,469
the US Congress and the US senators just

00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:47,829
about that domestic spying it's not a

00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:51,099
question if that's that form of spying

00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:54,549
or mass surveillance will end for people

00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:59,229
outside your soil or non-us citizen we

00:12:54,549 --> 00:13:02,469
should keep that in mind prism is of

00:12:59,229 --> 00:13:05,199
course the system the internal computer

00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:06,609
system that collect this data and that

00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:08,739
is what two days later when should we

00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:12,579
ate at the US Director of National

00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:16,449
Intelligence released in a fake fact

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:19,029
sheet so what I would I speak about here

00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:20,919
is only what is where where's node

00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:23,049
Amenti from the US government's

00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,909
government site or from Director of

00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:27,669
National Intelligence there are some

00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:30,399
rare cases in that year of world ovation

00:13:27,669 --> 00:13:34,569
revelations that the u.s. government

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,759
said no here is the reporting not

00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:40,899
correct but mostly as I didn't even

00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:43,569
bother to to write a dementing I want to

00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:45,620
talk a little bit about the fees a

00:13:43,569 --> 00:13:47,690
decision because

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,960
in my opinion and the public sphere is

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:55,570
not quite clear to everybody that this

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:59,330
form of mass surveillance is legal in

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,920
most forms because of that pfizer

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:04,400
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,830
generally speaking under that pfizer any

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,110
form of electronic surveillance is

00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,330
permissible if there is a probable cause

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:15,050
to believe that the target is a foreign

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:16,820
agent or foreign power and the primary

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,050
purpose of the investigation is

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:23,480
collection of foreign intelligence

00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:25,970
information and in section 218 of pfizer

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,740
even that requirement that for

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:30,560
intelligence gathering be the primary

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:34,100
purpose of the investigation was

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:38,750
eliminated now it only requires that it

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:42,290
be a significant purpose and this act

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:45,350
you may be right about it in the

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:48,080
newspapers also established a special

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,870
secret court composed of hand selected

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:55,790
court judges to review the applications

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:58,040
for a chronic surveillance orders but in

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,970
the secret courts he is only the

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:04,900
government's evidence and the FISA Court

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,770
is not revealing any public informations

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,410
information concerning electronic

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:12,320
surveillance with the exception of an

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,529
annual report detailing only the number

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,180
the request made so the secret FISA

00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:23,300
Court is also a very silent court and

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:26,800
this silent court and secret court have

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:30,950
never refused a single request in its

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,810
21-year history until 2002 when the

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:36,680
bounties he was paid to it it became law

00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,839
so that is the kind of oversight we have

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,580
which completely fade not speaking about

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:45,589
the political oversight but the judges

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,810
well but allowing secret riots based on

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,180
secret evidence with secret outcomes and

00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:52,339
no public scrutiny to ensure any form of

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,670
famous would be a talk on its own so and

00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,880
I stopped talking about that that legal

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,770
site

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,320
now well speaking of the company's the

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:06,210
cooperating companies then if a company

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,490
like Google receives a valid fisa court

00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:12,090
order it has of course to deliver any

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:15,930
information requested of course so from

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:19,290
the beginning and it's even after a year

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:22,560
one of the largest scandals and all

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,860
those revelations and they imagine an

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,680
interesting discussion about metadata

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:31,920
you see on the picture an example this

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,040
is from a Greek scandal some years ago

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,560
where the whole government and the

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,900
president and ministers were tapped and

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,490
and this is a press conference actually

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,620
a picture from a press conference where

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,650
they plotted from one of those

00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:53,610
surveillance software products so that

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:54,960
you see what meta data would be would be

00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:58,950
seen at the screen of course if you have

00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:02,040
it on a computer you can interact of

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:05,490
course with that it's just the problem

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,680
is that meta data and most of that

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:16,199
survey and stuff is really it's abstract

00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:17,939
in a way I mean it's not really you you

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,620
cannot really feel the surveillance if

00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:21,660
you sit in a cafe and there's somebody

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:24,060
really staring staring at you the whole

00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,939
time then you would maybe say stop doing

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:29,400
that don't look at my screen don't don't

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:32,700
listen to my phone calls but if you have

00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,340
that made her dad a discussion it's not

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,030
the same as surveillance in a physical

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:40,980
world so what what's really at risk here

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,740
most people don't most people don't

00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,530
realize but the media that the

00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:50,180
discussion goes on until now and maybe

00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:53,880
people have a decision about that and

00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:55,260
from the US Supreme Court later that

00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,150
year or in the next year that is

00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:02,670
possible I come back to that metadata

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:04,440
later of course why they are interested

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:07,080
in that meta data so much is because

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,420
it's significantly easier to collect in

00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,820
store because of the volume of the data

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:15,360
and it's much easier to detect any

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:17,790
anomaly meaning anomalies and personal

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,370
communication behavior like is there a

00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:24,750
person starting to communicate with it

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:27,390
each other is it may be on it may be in

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:30,000
night time so you can have filters or

00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:34,500
triggers in any form to detect those

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,290
anomalies and ask maybe for a special

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,560
identifier like phone number or in my

00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,890
numbers and it's of course it's optimal

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,600
for any form of automatic filtering so

00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:49,050
that media that the discussion is not

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:54,000
over now of course in Europe meter that

00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:57,210
belongs to the data that is protected by

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,340
the right privacy it's maybe not the

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:03,530
same in the US but we will maybe see

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:06,420
from court decision this all next year

00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:09,540
after the first revelations about the

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,760
prison program and the starting meter

00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,940
data discussion general Keith Alexander

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,760
the then director of the NSA which is of

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:20,760
course a general because the head of the

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,940
NSA is always a military guy confirmed

00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,140
and to public hearing of US

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,560
Congressional Intelligence Review

00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:30,030
Committee's let the NSA collect post

00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:33,180
domestic and international telephone

00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:37,380
call metadata from all major US carriers

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:41,910
and maintains a database of all such

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:44,510
code for five years so we know no but

00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:48,720
actually that is for all the revelations

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:52,260
will that I speak about here we just

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,760
know nothing really changed there is an

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:59,340
initiative right now and the US Congress

00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:02,070
to change some of some of those programs

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:05,400
but actually it's just for domestic

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:07,230
spying it's not for European let's let's

00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,270
say not for us

00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:17,630
um the next the next step in that

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:21,450
scandal which is the third one from from

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,490
or I believe that that it's one of the

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,650
latter scandal is a tempura program what

00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,320
you see here our anti-sea cable a

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:32,809
commercial undersea cable which we have

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:37,440
today you see a little anomaly because

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:39,570
if you would have an undersea cable

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:45,090
today then you maybe wouldn't wouldn't

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:47,010
choose that route from UK to New York

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:49,559
over the ocean but that come from the

00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:54,470
telegraph lines more than hundred years

00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:58,410
ago and as the tether telegraph lines

00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,360
were invented actually they didn't know

00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:02,340
very much about the underground of the

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:08,870
ocean so they just took a direct route

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:12,900
and that is the reason that more than

00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,240
eighty-five percent maybe of all the

00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:18,960
connections between the European

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:21,240
continent and the Americas goes through

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,660
the British island and that's why with

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,179
the temporal program the GCHQ started to

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:30,410
be part of the scandal that is the

00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:36,210
british one of the british spy agencies

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:39,870
hmm GCHQ or wasn't actually exaggerating

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:41,580
when it invented the phrase mastering

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:43,919
the internet which is the name of one of

00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:47,580
the programs as to be found in the

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:52,980
Snowden documents within those tempura

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:55,559
program some 300 GCHQ plus 250 NSA

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,210
agents have the task to analyze the data

00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:01,320
that ghosts of those through the

00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:05,010
undersea cables and this is this is

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:08,309
stored app for up to three days for

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:11,429
content and up to 30 days for meta data

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:17,180
because the volume is of course not the

00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:19,760
type you see we we talked about at 20

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:22,930
petabyte that means million gigabytes in

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:27,020
that three days and those events it's

00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:30,350
really the stuff we do every day on our

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,960
mobile phones and over the Internet so

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:34,520
it's not an event like a technical term

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,220
but it's all communication and our

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,110
inmates and our photos and stuff and of

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,330
course it's the same as the prison

00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:44,870
program to cooperating companies which

00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:48,380
are not only the well-known companies

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:50,510
like Patricia Newcomb or verizon it's

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:53,080
also the backbone providers because of

00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:57,740
course part of the temp our program our

00:22:53,080 --> 00:23:02,800
hardware devices all the places where as

00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:06,380
an undersea cable land on British soil

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:10,690
as we know most of the bits we click is

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:14,840
BitTorrent youtube and youporn of course

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:16,700
and to reduce the sheer volume of the

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:21,320
data running through the undersea cables

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:24,320
em like peer-to-peer downloads and it's

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:29,600
discarded of course by filters and this

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:34,190
reduces the volume about by a by thirty

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:37,730
percent maybe and those filters not only

00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:41,390
were using the data volume but also a

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:44,330
triggered by words by email addresses of

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:48,170
phone numbers so the data stream is

00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:52,070
actually filtered categorized and stored

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:58,570
if it's of any interest all in all GCHQ

00:23:52,070 --> 00:24:01,820
and NSA which work as a yeah it's it's

00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:04,730
it's more like that's really close

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:08,420
working together at least and the top

00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:13,880
our program and they use around 40,000

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:16,640
of those triggers to filter and analyze

00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:21,350
the data that is law that flows over the

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,860
undersea cable so we know that for a

00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:27,260
year now and the question for all the

00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:29,159
european countries and not only europe

00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,379
but worldwide actually is

00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,090
we're going to do about it we talked

00:24:31,379 --> 00:24:35,960
about the tempura program here in Europe

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:39,029
a lot but there's also an exact

00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:42,840
duplicate of the program for the pack

00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:45,659
net which is a Asian Pacific undersea a

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:52,169
cable net so it's actually a worldwide

00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:54,869
undersea cable surveillance program for

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,649
my opinion at least in Germany the

00:24:54,869 --> 00:25:01,379
public debate it's not only Germany its

00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:06,809
worldwide I guess really changed when

00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:10,789
one prominent German person and her

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:18,019
mobile phone was tapped and to me it's

00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:20,669
until now I a scandal that only this one

00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:24,299
tapping out from mobile phone which is

00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:26,159
Chancellor Angela Merkel of course it's

00:25:24,299 --> 00:25:28,590
really a scandal in a political sphere

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,720
and not the mass surveillance and the

00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,749
offensive hacking techniques we learn

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,749
from

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:46,890
okay I see you agree and since I don't

00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:49,980
have the time to follow that chronology

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:53,010
of that year step by step because you

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:57,390
could really need five hours for that I

00:25:53,010 --> 00:26:00,390
just want to have a short break and tell

00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:03,660
you just in some words what happened

00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:06,330
afterwards until maybe am the end of the

00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,800
year because I guess you remember from

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:12,990
reading the newspaper what happened and

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:15,480
this year after jun 21 where GCHQ's

00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:17,580
tempura tapping fiber optic cables

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,230
became known which was from The Guardian

00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:25,460
in July we also had a attack lyst a

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:30,440
target list reported by The Guardian

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:35,700
about a cyber attacks that was a list of

00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:38,510
quite a lot of targets worldwide in July

00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,340
we also learned that the NSA is spying

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:43,980
explicitly in Asia in Hong Kong and they

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,070
are also hacking attempts and against

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,560
China and that the u.s. hacked pacnet

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,600
which is the Asian Pacific fiber optic

00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:56,520
and the network as I as I mentioned and

00:26:51,600 --> 00:27:01,050
not only from one year or two but from

00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:04,470
2009 on in July 31 we also learned about

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:09,990
xkeyscore which is essential to the NSA

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:13,710
uses to aggregate nearly everything from

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:16,500
the internet as the guardian road in

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,050
August it was just one month later and

00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,750
we all thought is summer maybe they were

00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:24,570
releasing slept and we learnt about even

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:29,460
more cyber attacks by the US and mostly

00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:32,880
NSA and that were 231 offensive

00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:37,470
operations even in one year and in

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,300
September first time there was really

00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:41,340
blood on the data because we learned

00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:43,440
from an article in The Washington Post

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:46,200
that the NSA has ties to the US drone

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:49,149
attack them and that metadata and

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,059
content data explicitly

00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:55,979
were dumped into the US drone program

00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:59,440
that meaning that means that that data

00:27:55,979 --> 00:28:05,769
triggered the CIA driven drone program

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:09,190
and well it was a reaper and Predator

00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:13,839
drone with the hell fire rocket were

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:16,389
sent to mobile phones to deliver the

00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:19,499
bombs so actually that was not really

00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:22,149
reported in your very much but in the US

00:28:19,499 --> 00:28:25,749
it was reported from the Washington Post

00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:28,929
as I said and I guess that is a

00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:32,320
discussion we should we should follow

00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:34,739
closely because I think in this year

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:39,399
2014 we will have more of those

00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:41,019
connections between CIA drone program

00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,690
and the media doesn't count data

00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,450
collection of the NSA because if you

00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:49,089
want to fire a hair fire rocket then you

00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:52,779
need the data to know which mobile phone

00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:57,519
to target in September we even had the

00:28:52,779 --> 00:29:03,039
first cyber war attack as defined by the

00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:07,149
natto NATO and that was as the GCHQ

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:11,109
targeted in spite on belgacom which the

00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:14,409
speaker reported actually become as one

00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:18,929
of the main telecom carriers in Belgium

00:29:14,409 --> 00:29:21,609
and the GCHQ passively sniffing hecht

00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:27,309
some of the maintainer of the network

00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:30,820
and faked LinkedIn pages to target those

00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:32,859
engineer and they had success and that

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:36,339
is really a cyberwar attack as defined

00:29:32,859 --> 00:29:38,440
by the NATO against another native

00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:40,119
country which was very good that was

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,859
really interesting because that kind of

00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:49,210
attack was the first time we heard about

00:29:41,859 --> 00:29:52,779
that um we even had a in October that

00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:55,299
wasn't October second em a location data

00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:58,269
scandal but it wasn't really reported

00:29:55,299 --> 00:30:00,820
worldwide because and the NSA collection

00:29:58,269 --> 00:30:01,600
a mass collection of use cell phone

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,270
location

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,490
it was only reported in English and not

00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:09,640
so much on the European country so we

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:11,559
see we have also of course not only the

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:15,070
communication and social graph from

00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:18,549
prison but also a geolocation program

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:24,880
which runs geo location profiles

00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:26,710
applause um maybe I stop here I mean you

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,600
can read it in the newspapers and I

00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:34,809
guess as I as I took a look of all the

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,049
papers i'm researching for that scandals

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:40,809
for about a year now and some of those

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:43,710
reports in the different newspapers not

00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:47,710
only american and european but also

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:51,250
brazilian and asian newspapers i simply

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:54,309
forget because all the small scandals in

00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:56,169
between really forgotten when you think

00:30:54,309 --> 00:31:00,669
about the really big scandals we have

00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:08,100
here and the lack of oversight for that

00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:11,409
mafia like Secret Service complex where

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,390
what we learned from that Chronicle

00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:17,919
ology and I took it on one slide because

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:19,630
I wanted to have in one place that does

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,650
have we learned over the months these

00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,600
are priorities Aten targets from those

00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:28,510
NSA programs as you clearly see these

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,700
are the top terrorists we have in the

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:35,559
word and the targets are the EU

00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:38,230
institutions and also the Parliament 80

00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:42,159
embassies worldwide heads of foreign

00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:44,409
governments and two from those heads we

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,820
know by name this is a Brazilian

00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:51,370
President Rousseff and and the German

00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,780
Chancellor maca we also have the top

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:59,530
terrorist at the g20 meetings which were

00:31:54,780 --> 00:32:02,200
tapped and they even in the g20 meetings

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:07,330
they even invented fake internet cafes

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:11,149
to to grab some passwords of the teams

00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:14,749
of the politicians meeting at the g20

00:32:11,149 --> 00:32:16,639
also the OPEC the World Bank large

00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:18,799
companies like the Brazilian pit row

00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:22,700
bustle we have a list of priorities here

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:23,989
but we have even more we also have from

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,950
the revelations the National

00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:31,279
Intelligence priority framework and this

00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:32,599
is a kind of matrix from that's just the

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,179
part you see here and you don't have to

00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:39,889
read it I copied it or see it in the

00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:44,089
next slide it's a matrix of targets as

00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:46,999
in contents what is really what kind of

00:32:44,089 --> 00:32:50,450
topics are those Secret Service

00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:53,929
interested and you would maybe oh wait

00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:58,190
for national security issues but I

00:32:53,929 --> 00:33:02,690
copied it for Germany from that

00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:05,239
framework and what you see here are the

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,089
targets in that framework that a psycho

00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:11,259
tech counter espionage emerging so TT

00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:14,690
technologies clearly a top terrorist

00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:17,599
problem international trade policy arms

00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:19,549
export arms control foreign policy

00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:24,529
objectives economic and financial

00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:27,710
stability so it's really what we lack

00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:30,259
from that year is that it's much more

00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,759
about economics buying then the

00:33:30,259 --> 00:33:34,179
political discussion and the discussion

00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:37,219
in the newspaper is about they always

00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:39,710
argue with the questions of national

00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:41,450
security but as we know from the

00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:45,469
revelations it's much more about

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:49,989
economics buying and actually the

00:33:45,469 --> 00:33:52,999
scandals are much more about power and

00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:59,269
access to information and then about

00:33:52,999 --> 00:34:02,330
national security mmm and if you see the

00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:05,629
ideology behind it and I thought that

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:09,289
from the Deputy Attorney General James

00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:12,109
Cole then you have that metaphor of the

00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:13,940
hay steak he said if you're looking for

00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:17,659
a needle in the haystack you have to get

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,850
the haystack first and what we learned

00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:23,120
from all those program

00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:25,370
and is that the piling even more hey and

00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:29,480
what we also learned and I come to that

00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:32,960
in a minute despite that that piling on

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:37,730
mohane doesn't really help to find the

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,820
needle um but before I come back to that

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:45,430
ideology I want to talk a little bit

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:48,710
about the dimension of what we actually

00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:51,710
fight against now and that as part of

00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:55,940
the revelations to its so-called like

00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:58,550
budget then injure most most German of

00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:01,940
at least yeah most charming countries

00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:07,310
you know about the budget those secret

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:09,830
services as a money or receive and when

00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:13,010
we have the nineteen German secret

00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:15,110
services so we know as a population what

00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,180
money we spent on that that was

00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:18,770
different in the United States so the

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,100
black patridge revelation was really

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:26,480
interesting to take a look at and US

00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:30,470
national intelligence budget and that is

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:36,650
of course you see it here over 50

00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:41,270
billion dollar a year and that is much

00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:43,120
more than even than even some of the

00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:46,820
politicians and the review committees

00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,430
new as I talk to William Binney who's

00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,770
been here in Berlin because we have a

00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:56,390
commission in the German Bundestag the

00:35:51,770 --> 00:36:00,170
NSA on decimals office and we talked

00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:02,540
about that budget on her um honor on a

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:07,010
podium here in Berlin and he said okay

00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:10,160
that 50 billion dollar per year is not

00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:12,350
sufficient and I looked at him like what

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,110
you mean not sufficient it's not that

00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:19,130
much or even more he said it's even more

00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:24,830
because some also Secret Service batches

00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:27,320
are in let's say in military stuff it's

00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:29,450
it's hiding somewhere he said in his act

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:33,060
of time in the NSA the budget was

00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:36,060
already eighty billion dollar per year

00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,720
said that some years ago so it's maybe

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:44,310
even more that meaning he corrected the

00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:46,710
budget above yeah but I was a I was

00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:49,410
really staring at him at that moment

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:52,920
because I thought 50 billion dollar was

00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:56,610
quite a lot if if you think about how

00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,950
many nurses he could pay from that uh

00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:03,000
how many Rockets your consent so two

00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:05,670
moon from that from that money and I'm

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,370
running a bit out of time but I'm I want

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,920
to talk a little bit about the tailored

00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:15,030
exits operation because the most of the

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,280
scandal in the public sphere talked

00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:20,820
about the mass surveillance media data

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,090
content data and you know the little and

00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:27,390
the larger scandals but for me as an

00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:30,570
hacker it's of course interesting what

00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:33,660
they do in in the tailored access

00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:37,080
operations and what kind of exploits

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:40,380
they really have and what are the

00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:43,980
methods actually that they are using em

00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:48,420
in the Snowden papers we know know that

00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:50,430
ta o quella Texas operations have has

00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:53,460
exploit against windows mac OS windows

00:37:50,430 --> 00:38:00,560
and iOS and some more which are named

00:37:53,460 --> 00:38:05,130
and that some of those exploits um a

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:09,990
really zero day exploits but most of

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:13,230
them are known so hmm they spend maybe

00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:15,810
quite a lot of money to to have access

00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:18,300
to those exploits and we also learned

00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:21,900
actually that the gray and black market

00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:24,690
for a computer vulnerabilities or mobile

00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:30,780
phone vulnerabilities and malware of all

00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:33,930
kinds let that gray market is paid from

00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,570
those Secret Service budgets so we

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,210
wouldn't even have the gray and black

00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:42,110
market on that large scale if they

00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:47,390
wouldn't spend that money on that they

00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:49,619
had different methods within the TA oh

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:52,800
operation the meaning of course

00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,240
backdoors that's what we expected it was

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:57,560
a manipulation of random number

00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,109
generators because that's a good way to

00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:04,500
weaken encryption and they had an intent

00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:08,880
of cooperation with NIST mistis standard

00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:14,010
institute who every where every 10 years

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,609
a new and krypton standards are somewhat

00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:21,780
invented I wouldn't they invented but

00:39:16,609 --> 00:39:25,500
missed was really releasing a press

00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:29,220
statement and some parts they said yes

00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,940
we did cooperate with secret services

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,800
they even tried for that part of the

00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:36,780
data collection they had which was

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,970
encrypted to get the master encryption

00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:43,380
keys with different methods and the

00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:46,920
programs they have for that called a

00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:51,960
bully run for the NSA and action for the

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:55,589
GCHQ they have really 255 million dollar

00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:59,130
a year and it's if you think about it in

00:39:55,589 --> 00:40:01,260
fact an auntie security program and it's

00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:04,980
undermines of course the trust we have

00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:07,800
and the IT system who use every day that

00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:12,349
was really interesting to learn about

00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:15,750
the offensive strategies from those

00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:17,730
secret services they really have a lot

00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:23,880
of hackers in that they that they pay

00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:28,010
and it really had to change to change it

00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,599
on the on the on the edge of ideological

00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:32,339
wait guess if you take a look at the

00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:35,400
British and the American hacker

00:40:32,339 --> 00:40:38,250
community is quite common to work for

00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,520
some years for NSA contractors or even

00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:46,830
for the NSA's of its may be very

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:50,520
different from the European heavens when

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:52,260
we heard all that and I missed a lot of

00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,140
Revelations because I don't have time to

00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,540
collect them all here but I want to talk

00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,850
a little bit about the success so what

00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,000
about

00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:04,000
national security and I copied this from

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,900
the so-called White House panel which US

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:13,990
President Barack Obama initiated is a

00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:19,120
commission and will be run by Secret

00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:21,460
Service veterans and even those Secret

00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:26,320
Service guy who clearly belong to the

00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:30,550
intelligence community wrote this in

00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:32,710
their report the metadata of the tele

00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:35,080
vacation brings only a modest

00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:38,770
contribution to the nation's security

00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:41,470
and there has been no instance in which

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:44,200
NSA could say with confidence that the

00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:46,390
outcome of a terror investigation would

00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,840
have been any different without the meta

00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:52,480
data so the stupid phrases we heard in

00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,120
the beginning of that scandal that all

00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,200
that mass surveillance explicitly meta

00:41:55,120 --> 00:42:02,740
data but also cantata would help against

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:06,210
terrorists attack is quite nonsense and

00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,790
proceed in the white health report and

00:42:06,210 --> 00:42:13,750
the intelligence community itself who is

00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:16,390
sitting in that Commission stated in its

00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:20,250
own report that was really interesting

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:23,140
and as you may be as you may be no it

00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:28,180
wasn't really reported at least not in

00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:29,890
German and you may be now and I'm coming

00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:33,970
to the optimistic part of the talk now

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:36,820
right yeah they also targeting at all we

00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:39,690
know from October where the presentation

00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:42,850
the NSA presentation tour stinks and

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:44,980
were published that tours really

00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:50,760
targeting tourism anonymizing network as

00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:53,980
you maybe know and this July the German

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:59,520
ID and the zoo tortured citing had a

00:42:53,980 --> 00:43:03,130
publication that explicitly target users

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:04,660
they told you this a targeted other

00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:07,120
possibility interesting because they

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:09,180
release some of the filter roots of the

00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,809
deep packet inspection which

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:15,300
saying the GCHQ used to have triggers

00:43:12,809 --> 00:43:16,800
for every toy user and not only toy user

00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:21,000
but also people who search for

00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,619
information about tour um that was

00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,230
really interesting because right now

00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:27,990
tour is the only affordable and reliable

00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:31,530
technology for people in for example

00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:33,480
China or Iran to communicate encrypted

00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:38,010
and anonymized with the rest of the

00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,930
world one of those tour service is

00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:44,130
operated by the chaos computer club here

00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:47,609
in Germany and so the data traffic to

00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:50,839
and from those so called tour directory

00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:54,059
service it's been taken into the

00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:58,829
repositories of the NSA and that was the

00:43:54,059 --> 00:44:04,309
reason that we fired again a criminal

00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:08,099
complaint against angular mecha

00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:10,470
ministers in Germany the head of the

00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:14,540
secret services in Germany and foreign

00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:18,299
secret services and mostly everybody who

00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:22,770
could be may be responsible for that

00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:25,650
because I guess at least we don't only

00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:27,869
need political help and we need

00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,000
technical tools to fight against those

00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:32,760
and it's a must surveillance and

00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,420
especially targeted surveillance like

00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:38,339
that one but we also should use the loss

00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,619
existing and that's why we fight a

00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:43,829
criminal complaint against those

00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:46,530
aggressive surveillance in Germany

00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:50,160
directly and we just hope that the

00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:53,430
Gannet I bonus invited the state federal

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:58,170
prosecutor I guess haha tanga now or

00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:01,920
maybe do this job and I ask the NSA and

00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:04,549
gchq some questions and

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,549
so

00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:16,299
I'm not quite sure if this will work out

00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:17,410
but we even lit and we even tried em and

00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:19,390
what I want to talk a little bit and

00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:22,230
that's the last thing I want to want to

00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:25,210
talk about learn about other ways to

00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:29,559
defend against those mass surveillance

00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:36,730
and I quote here former GCHQ memo from

00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:39,339
May 2012 where the GCHQ said our main

00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:42,180
concern is that references to agency

00:45:39,339 --> 00:45:45,339
practices meaning the scale of

00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:47,470
interception and deletion could lead to

00:45:45,339 --> 00:45:49,990
damaging public debate which might lead

00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:54,039
to legal challenges against the current

00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:56,410
regime and the scale of interception and

00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:58,839
retention required would be fairly

00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:00,549
likely to be challenged on article 8 the

00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,700
right of privacy grants and that is

00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:06,490
exactly what we did because the article

00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:11,140
aid as part of the European human rights

00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:13,650
convention and the UK different from the

00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:18,069
events of course ratified that

00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:21,190
convention in 1951 so it's bounded to

00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:24,130
that Convention and a big brother watch

00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:28,779
open rights group and the English pen

00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:31,930
and myself we had a joint application to

00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:37,650
the European Court of Human Rights and

00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:41,349
transport so we try to go the legal way

00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:43,450
though I think we should protect

00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:54,160
ourselves on a technical way and to

00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:56,309
begin with of course m-maybe in the end

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,470
of July we will know a little bit more

00:46:56,309 --> 00:47:01,779
from the court because we until now we

00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:04,890
have a so-called rule 41 which means

00:47:01,779 --> 00:47:08,950
that our cases are prioritized but

00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:12,430
actually the court although we have that

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:14,440
fast track and I stopped the process a

00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,869
little bit because of the British

00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,140
tribunal

00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:22,140
which is a also a secret court on UK

00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:24,119
soil where groups like privacy

00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,210
international and try to make a case to

00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:29,990
and so they waited for that outcome so

00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:33,359
we just know maybe in a few days and

00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:35,880
where the case goes we just right now

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,660
have a catalog of questions for the

00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,519
British government and also for the

00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:43,859
German government because I'm a German

00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:45,809
citizen but until now the German

00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:49,019
government decided to not really answer

00:47:45,809 --> 00:47:52,769
any other questions um but I guess it's

00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:56,339
um just a legal way and we should try

00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:58,670
that and I'm really very satisfied that

00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:01,470
a lot of people thousands of people

00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:04,710
spend money on that cases we had in just

00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:08,609
48 hours the 20,000 pounds we needed for

00:48:04,710 --> 00:48:11,339
that case together and very little which

00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:14,220
is five or six euro come from all over

00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:17,460
Germany and just 48 hours we we had that

00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:20,089
the sum we needed together was I'm very

00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,410
proud of that and I feel and that

00:48:20,089 --> 00:48:24,150
different from the opinion you you read

00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:28,829
in the newspaper people actually care

00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:32,130
and they are they want to support that's

00:48:28,829 --> 00:48:36,230
our fearless but the legal way is one

00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:39,749
thing and to put political pressure on

00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:42,450
those responsible for that but I think

00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:45,989
as a tech community first of all we

00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:50,009
should use encryption and not only use

00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:53,900
it but implemented that is what we

00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:56,249
should do in our normal working habits

00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:58,249
because we should we as a technical

00:48:56,249 --> 00:49:02,910
community should help the normal user

00:48:58,249 --> 00:49:05,640
because he will rely on us to have

00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:08,930
working encryption because the NSA must

00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,640
surveillance programs they doesn't scale

00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:14,489
it's just ten or fifteen percent of

00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,079
users really switch and krypton on they

00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:19,609
get blinded and that's what we actually

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,609
should do so

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:34,820
so that's actually what I demand from

00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:40,430
you use encryption but that only use it

00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:43,150
but implemented and be as transparent as

00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:46,250
possible when using encryption in

00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:50,780
technologies or software you built let

00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:53,210
us I guess to rebuild the trust that is

00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:57,830
lost that it's essential for that so be

00:49:53,210 --> 00:50:03,980
estrin parent as you can we should not

00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:08,500
only cut we should not only cut the

00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:12,680
budgets of the professional peeping toms

00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:14,660
but also raise the standards in general

00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,000
for the government to look at everyday

00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:19,100
communication data emitted at a content

00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,910
data purchase records medical records

00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:24,170
and so on because by its very nature

00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:28,400
mass surveillance is neither necessary

00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:31,970
nor proportioned because these

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,860
technology enable the violation of human

00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:36,770
rights it's a you annoyed issue

00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:40,370
particularly the rights of privacy and

00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:43,100
also the human rights of freedom of

00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:46,700
expression so eavesdropping on that

00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:51,610
massive scale is simply not acceptable

00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,610
in free societies or let's site it thank

00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:22,829
I'm not quite sure haga are we supposed

00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:26,310
to have a question and after I don't

00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:28,890
know and I don't want to be that

00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:33,390
negative I hope you have an optimistic

00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:34,950
feeling right now two microphones you

00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:36,690
can go over there or here and we have

00:51:34,950 --> 00:51:41,640
like let's say five minutes and then we

00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:44,579
is this thing on it is thank you for

00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:46,079
these amazing insights thank you I have

00:51:44,579 --> 00:51:50,400
two questions which are actually

00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,990
basically one what would happen if one

00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,150
of these companies at some point just

00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:59,609
says no and what would happen if all

00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:01,950
these companies their CEOs come together

00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:06,300
and they make the agreement and they say

00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:11,220
no can you tell me can you you have any

00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:13,170
insights into that well well that is not

00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:16,020
not such a trivia question it's really

00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:22,619
complex question actually the point is I

00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:26,400
have maybe two to remind you that the

00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:28,319
interception techniques are built into

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,450
all commercial telecommunication

00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,180
networks by law and they have standard

00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:36,270
so-called etsy standards so as a

00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:40,050
technique to intercept is from a legal

00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:43,140
perspective necessary to be a commercial

00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:47,640
telecom carrier in all Western countries

00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:51,210
meaning is that the possibility is

00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,579
already there and from a legal

00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:56,099
perspective and not only the US

00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:59,460
companies but in many European countries

00:52:56,099 --> 00:53:01,470
too they are simply obliged to hand over

00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:05,880
the region what they could to actually

00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:10,020
is to switch on encryption to not lock

00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:12,390
any content and in that way help the

00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,490
users a little bit what they actually do

00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:16,800
right now mostly in the US is of course

00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:21,800
right open letters because they they see

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:24,390
and let us that the trust crisis and

00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,829
it's a question of economy right now in

00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:27,750
the European and Asian markets because

00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:34,190
they see that most

00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:40,740
the cloud as a cloud companies um that

00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:45,390
well it read rops the partners not even

00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:47,790
not even they don't have a lot of new

00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:50,280
contracts but they also have a second

00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:52,560
contracts from agent and european

00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:55,980
partners demanding from the US companies

00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:58,200
that they have special privacy contracts

00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:00,870
to the normal cloud contract and stuff

00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:04,200
and so the pressure from the economic

00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:07,050
sphere to the US administration it's

00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:11,340
getting higher so maybe that that that

00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:14,250
trust crisis will be not not only not

00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:17,100
solved in a political rearm but in

00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:21,720
economically arm we have a lot of small

00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:23,490
companies who says who say okay we built

00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:26,420
our technology that way that we can't

00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:31,230
hand over data like in the Tor network

00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:33,930
or or are they examples but weezer the

00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:39,080
huge telecom carriers and Internet

00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:42,000
companies they don't have a choice well

00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:44,220
it's interesting because if you step out

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,390
for a moment and you look at what's

00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:52,850
happening it's basically it's the

00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:55,620
nation-state an institution with an army

00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:57,810
which is very powerful of course but

00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:59,850
it's interesting to think what would

00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:02,580
actually happening be happening on the

00:54:59,850 --> 00:55:06,210
enforcement side of things if a group of

00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:09,420
these companies just agree not to

00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:13,140
participate where they actually do point

00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:17,450
is that we as users we tend to use the

00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:23,300
large companies so maybe I urge you to

00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:23,300
think more decentralized thank you

00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:35,840
hi we're here at the Python conference

00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:43,920
edel and Rozonda creator of python has

00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:47,010
been working in a company that makes

00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,550
sure we all have our data secure our

00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:55,070
most important data secure for the last

00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:59,240
three years this company has just

00:55:55,070 --> 00:56:04,470
acquired a new member of the board of

00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:06,570
directors which is Condoleezza Rice one

00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:09,510
of the main supporters of massive

00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:12,690
surveillance which is working at the

00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:15,480
same company of the guy who created this

00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:21,600
beautiful language what are your

00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:23,220
thoughts about it yes what you referring

00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:28,410
to is actually the so-called revolving

00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:29,940
door right is that what you meant it's

00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:32,970
awkward revolving door that that you

00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:34,770
have is a lot of people who switch

00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:36,180
between companies contractors secret

00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:43,350
services and stuff that's that's what do

00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:46,170
you mean i'm in dropbox i don't really

00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:48,810
care well sorry dropbox is a company

00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:51,960
where you can keep yeah you can keep all

00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:54,660
your most important files in the cloud

00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:56,580
well guilmon resin is working the

00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:58,710
creator of python is working for that

00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:02,550
company for the last three years this

00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:04,590
company just added a new member to the

00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:07,530
boards of directors which is Condoleezza

00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:10,890
Rice one of the main supporters of

00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:12,540
masters violence one of the one of the

00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:16,920
people who explained that is necessary

00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:20,720
to have some and now I get you a of

00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:26,070
course I read in the news and maybe

00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:28,950
since at the hope top 10 in New York at

00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:32,390
what Snowden referred to that case so

00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:35,040
maybe most people are aware now when I

00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:38,070
don't have really any any any good

00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:41,220
comment on that I guess it's not the

00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:43,050
only case I feel

00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:45,540
I think it's just something we should

00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:51,530
all think about and maybe talk to give

00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:51,530
about it thank you okay

00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:56,170
