Description: 
	Markus Zapke-Gründemann - Writing multi-language documentation using Sphinx
[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

How to write multi-language documentation? What tools can you use? What mistakes should you avoid? This talk is based on the experiences I gathered while working on several multi-language documentation projects using Sphinx.

-----

Internationalized documentation is a fairly new topic. And there are different approaches to do this. I will talk about how Sphinx internationalization support works, which tools and services I use and how to organize the translation workflow in an Open Source project. Finally I will have a look at what the future of internationalization in Sphinx might bring.

okay again welcome to this ten o'clock

00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:22,840
session on this Wednesday was as Marcus

sup goog wyndham an active member of the

00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,300
jungle community in Germany and he will

00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:36,430
tell us something about multi-language

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:39,000
documentation in swings yeah yeah

00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:42,730
morning everyone hope everyone can gimme

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,489
yeah okay great um yeah so nice you all

00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:50,079
came to give the talk hope you can you

00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:53,260
tell you something new yeah yes Father

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,850
already introduced I'm our member of the

00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,620
german general community ah and yeah i'm

00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,070
doing software development since now

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:04,869
nearly 15 years started with pearl then

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,299
doing some PHP now mostly I'm doing

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:10,840
price and jungle staff and also involved

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:14,380
with the open data community in Germany

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,009
and I also do a lot of training with

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,920
people basically django training and i

00:01:18,009 --> 00:01:23,310
have a company called trench coat and

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,979
i'm a board member of the german jingle

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,899
association so um if you have anything

00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,090
about Jengo and Gemma you can also talk

00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:33,159
to me and you can find me on the

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:38,579
internet on a crime link day or at crime

00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:42,279
link on twitter yeah so some basics

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,849
first short introduction of swings so

00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:49,479
who m is already using swings here in

00:01:45,849 --> 00:01:52,029
the room ok so maybe half of the people

00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:53,799
of ok sir introduction is good yes so

00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:56,529
swings they say price and documentation

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,450
generator which means it is written in

00:01:56,529 --> 00:02:01,840
price and it's not only for Python you

00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:05,469
can use swings for any project you want

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,060
to so ah yeah any language you want to

00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:08,800
you can even document stuff which has

00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:12,040
nothing to do with programming at all if

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,750
you want to and the markup language is

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,520
called we structured text which is

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,980
something which was if i remember

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,290
correctly was invented by the pricing

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,260
community it is something comparable to

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:28,170
mark down which many people

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:30,390
no already and the interesting thing is

00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:32,280
that you have a lot of output formats so

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,110
you are you restructure text documents

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,000
and you can create a lot of output

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:39,870
formats as you can see here like HTML

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,930
and lot H and of course PDF epub take

00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:47,010
simple manual pages plain text so you

00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:49,379
also have the opportunity to display

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,260
your documentation properly on different

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:55,049
devices and swings can be found on

00:02:52,260 --> 00:03:00,090
strings leche dr. Rock also Z swings to

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:02,069
comment ation um yeah and of course as

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,739
the title of the talks says I'm talking

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:08,099
about internationalization so um it's

00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,170
often referred to as i18n so because it

00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,120
is 18 letters and first letters I

00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,670
Lassiter's and so this is often the

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,069
abbreviation for internationalization

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:22,859
especially if you look at module names

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:27,629
in programming and the idea about I 18

00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:29,790
Anna's that you can translate the

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:31,980
strings inside your software without

00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,639
having to change your software all the

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,290
time because I mean if you would have

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,260
your software and inside all the

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,489
different our texts and the different

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,739
languages and you always have to switch

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,349
there in between while writing your

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:49,230
regular code this would really be a mess

00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:51,980
and of course you're so you need a like

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,540
transparent system to exchange are the

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,220
messages on the language of the messages

00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,180
with people see that use your software

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,730
and the most of the best may best known

00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,690
tool for that is at Newgate text which

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:10,519
is open source software and this is also

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:15,329
used in swings too creepy young

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:18,870
translations so and simple gitex example

00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:22,199
looks like this it was will be missing

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:27,150
on the left side but yeah I hope that's

00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,960
not that critical yeah so and it's

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:32,270
simply that you create a translation

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,930
catalog object I

00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:39,810
at this example the catalog is called

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:46,280
example and it's in a directory called

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:49,740
locate and a fall back through is simply

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,960
for changing the way of exception you

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,800
get if it's not existing so it's not

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,600
important at the moment and so what is

00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,640
missing here on the left side of the

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,430
screen is that there is an underscore

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:05,730
there so underscore equals tiga text

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:09,750
this is usually done everywhere also

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:11,310
underscore is used as a alias for the

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,920
context function so that you have to

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,840
write less a code for the

00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,730
internationalisation then you can see

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,180
this print statement always look on the

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,240
bright side of life and and you can see

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:28,050
that the string that is inside the print

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,270
statement or function call is again

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,150
inside this function call which uses

00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:37,740
this underscore which is in areas of

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:40,200
tiga text and this way you and collect

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,700
this string for translation so your

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,620
source language would be English in this

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,440
case and you would have English as the

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,260
source of your translations and then you

00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,600
can carry it inside this local directory

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,700
different example catalogs for each

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,200
language we're translate this English

00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,120
thing to something else so this is how

00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,550
get X basically box you collect the

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,010
source strings and then at the end you

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:10,530
translate them to your like target

00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:12,120
language of course this will happen is

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,100
happening behind the scenes for the

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,169
swings doing for you so you don't have

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,300
to do anything like that if you want to

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,840
translate your recommendation just four

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,200
short explanation of technical

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,970
background um yeah but but why use get

00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,550
text for translator documentation why

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,590
not simply copying all my files to a new

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,160
director we like from en tu I don't know

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,600
de or GP and simply translating all the

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,330
text documents again bits of

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,400
documentation again and then have the

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:44,910
documentation and different language

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,990
yeah so first problem is and if the

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,120
documentation is update

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,880
it in the regular language so the

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,820
instrumentation is updated and you have

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,620
a hard time on finding which stuff has

00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,300
been changed because you can't easily

00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,430
diff between them because all your

00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,040
content is different because you content

00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,560
as a digital language especially if you

00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,130
if you have a language like Japanese

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,770
which has 30 different characters like

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:13,800
Latin languages second problem then is

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,420
if you leave something out because maybe

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,030
you don't have the manpower Beaumont to

00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,010
translate the time or you don't know

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:23,310
what is the proper translation for for

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,350
this thing then it's simply gone or you

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,790
have to copy and paste this paragraph to

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,930
your documentation in English and

00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,780
remember that you still have to

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,790
translate it and if you is get text get

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,460
X will be placed all strings that

00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,340
haven't been translated automatically

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:41,550
with the original string so if you don't

00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,920
translate a single spring or paragraph

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,200
and you build your translator

00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,130
documentation you will still see the

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,170
original string um another thing or

00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:54,300
advantage is that your markup is not

00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:58,110
applicated because if you think of a

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:00,120
document with any mark up like with such

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,490
a checks or marked on whatever HTML and

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,560
you copy this whole document and you

00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:06,180
translate it you copy all the mark up

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,980
with it and if the mark-up has also

00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,100
changed because the documentation

00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:13,350
evolves and know the way it is displayed

00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,610
is also changed with the next release of

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:16,680
the documentation you have to do this

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,500
well in your translation but you only

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,680
want to do translation and markup so you

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,320
again have another problem and another

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:28,220
problem of yeah not using tools like

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,800
your text is that you exclude people um

00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:34,050
because for this usually you have to use

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,670
foods like get or mercurial which have

00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,680
to go and they have to understand how

00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:40,980
all this works maybe to approval press

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,040
then somewhere to get your translation

00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:46,530
merged in and so forth and sometimes

00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:50,850
people do translations are not familiar

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:53,100
is enough to get involved in this

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:56,610
process and so if you can use

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,310
professional translation tools um is

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,650
much more easier for the translators to

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,360
something for your project and these

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,700
professional translation tools also

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,620
offer you opportunities you normally

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,960
don't have with regular text editors

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,650
like these tools can for example show

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,750
you oh um it seems like that but this

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,520
paragraph has been translated before and

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:20,370
here have a text which is ninety percent

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:23,430
the same the translation ninety percent

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,080
the same like or similar to the text

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:27,960
that has there been before so you can

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,270
simply then get these ninety percent

00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:32,610
similar translation from a translation

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:35,130
cash put it in an simply change if you

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,070
worse so also your translation of

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:42,720
already existing and evolving

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:44,400
documentation as faster okay yeah so how

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,279
does it all work with swings not what I

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:51,510
explained and this is an illustration

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:54,690
from the swings documentation and yeah

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:56,940
and this shows how document eight or

00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:00,089
international as I segmentation is built

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,770
and swings so you see on the far left

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:10,080
the OST files em which are M then built

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:13,020
into p 0 T 4 miles which are templates

00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,960
so P always the extension for the source

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,520
files of gay text and p 0 t is in a

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,970
template for that so it's the source

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,520
language and then you translate these PT

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,260
fights here to like bootless mentioned

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:32,330
but there are also other tools to apo

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:32,330
fire and the p.o file is then again and

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:38,660
transferred into oh we have compiled

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,870
into a mo file and the ml file is a

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:45,060
binary version of your p.o file which is

00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:48,150
fast on excess so you can can get all

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,910
these translations rings faster and in

00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:53,100
the end then the hours T points are

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,350
taken again together with EML files and

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,089
then the all the original springs are

00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,339
replaced by the translator strings and

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:05,400
you have your are translated

00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:08,940
documentation if you want to do this em

00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:12,310
you have to do a few things our first

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:14,680
thing as if you haven't done this in

00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,820
so usually you have a docs directory

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,500
inside the doctor with you you have a

00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,940
comp I violent swings where you

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,990
configure how swings works and first

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,029
thing you have to do you have to say

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,830
which is my source language like the

00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:30,490
main language of my documentation in

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:33,089
this case it's English and you have to

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:35,080
say okay where I do all my arm

00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,430
translations go like with the other

00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,050
catalogues with the different other

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:43,260
languages and in this case it's see

00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:47,470
directory locate and then there's also a

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,230
fairly new configuration value get X

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,150
compact and if you set this to true and

00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,300
your documentation has several

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:58,330
subfolders all documents in a subfolder

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,210
are collected into a single catalog if

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:04,089
it sets us two folds you get a catalog

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:05,860
for each file so because if you have a

00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:07,620
documentation which consists of 50

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,270
different 5s and five different folders

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,610
you may only want to have five catalogs

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:16,089
instead of 50 because of next

00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:22,230
translation easier so you have different

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:22,230
opportunities here so to do the

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:30,430
translation in a easier way they r is in

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:35,320
in extension or plugin for swings called

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:39,700
swings int out um and yeah you can

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,350
install this I Apep um so that is

00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:45,400
available in addition to swings itself

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:46,990
and this will then hi Pierre to deal

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:51,000
with all the translation fights because

00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:55,720
it is possible to use swings itself and

00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
some gitex tools to create the p.o files

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:04,240
and mo files and all the stuff but this

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,180
is a very nasty way and also complicated

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,500
way of doing this and swings int our

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:13,270
makes this all easier so um yeah of

00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:17,440
swings int L instance thought first

00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:20,260
thing you do is make a text which are we

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,600
are called the built-in swings command

00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,350
to create all these

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,509
p OT files so it extracts all the

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:32,880
strings from the RC parts and put them

00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:36,639
into these catalogs and then um you say

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,529
swings int L update- L which is the

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,790
language so the new language I want like

00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:47,259
German and where should or where I'm i

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,449
am located and where I'm a pio pio t

00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:51,940
files like this build located directory

00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:54,819
so they are make it x tourism in this

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,940
directory and so this strings intr

00:13:54,819 --> 00:14:00,819
update command will fetch all these p 0

00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:05,199
t files mega decks created and create

00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:08,019
new german catalogs for that of course

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:10,420
there will be empty because this command

00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,009
is only like copying them and preparing

00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,440
them though so you can insert the german

00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:15,850
translation strings so the next thing

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,630
you have to do is translate the

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,660
documentation i will talk in a moment of

00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:24,009
all the details for that and then you

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,319
after you translated everything you can

00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:28,360
say swings int are built and then it

00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:31,720
will create all these mo files that have

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:35,050
been shown the image before and then in

00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:38,110
the end you can against a say and make

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:40,509
HTML which creates for example the HTML

00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,029
our documentation you can also say make

00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:52,569
PDF large or something else may keep up

00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:54,880
and with the swings ops yeah options you

00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:56,920
can say that the language should be

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,959
something different so you override the

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,259
language in the conf I of fire to create

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,790
a German HTML instead of an English one

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:05,769
because English the default language and

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:09,339
now you want something different so this

00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:11,019
is the four commands you need to equate

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,839
the catalogs and then translate them and

00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:19,350
build a different documentation language

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,240
yeah so what you can use for translation

00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:26,339
12 of course and also others but what is

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:29,699
very helpful at least to me is transifex

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:32,110
so join transifex is a web service so

00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:35,620
it's not a software you download it's

00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:39,920
more like a website you use and

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,450
it's free fallin source projects but if

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,420
you use commercial projects you have to

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:48,160
pay them of course because yeah they

00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:50,360
also need to have some income and

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,400
transifex really works like a

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:54,350
professional translation tool like which

00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,150
features i said like show me similar

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,760
strings I had before and author all

00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:01,100
things and it's also very nice tool

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,980
because you can collaborate with many

00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,810
other people on the same translation and

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,440
people can work together to translate or

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:12,230
the stuff online pip has a 20 X as a

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,490
also a command-line tool transfixed line

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,930
you pip install it you say TX in it and

00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,020
to user name and password so we said you

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:25,670
can that the transfixed line can talk to

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:28,160
the platform and then you can use swings

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,680
int L together with transifex because

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:36,440
swings ideal has transfixed support and

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:39,740
as you can see are you first run this

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,710
update TX so takes is the abbreviation

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:49,850
for 20 fix update cheeks conflict with

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:51,290
cirrhosis which prepares transifex so

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,780
that it can be used together with your

00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,610
swings documentation normally you have

00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,070
to do a lot of steps you manually and

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:01,970
swings I dls doing everything for you

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:04,430
here and then you can say tieks push

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:08,959
minus s and this is a little bit similar

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:11,060
to like get o mercurial so you push your

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,790
staff to transifex and minus s mean

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,949
sources so i push my english catalogs to

00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,600
transifex so that other people then can

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:20,660
create translations and translated to

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,459
German Spanish Japanese whatever f

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:25,490
translations has been have been

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:28,250
translated on transifex I can pull them

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,960
again with TX pull and I can explicitly

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,550
say which languages are gone for example

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,770
here again I want to put the German

00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,230
translation some people create it on

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,170
transit fix and then then again say okay

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,830
like 4 swings int Albert swings make

00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:45,080
HTML for German and now i have my are

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:48,460
like german for translation and can see

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,460
everything in german

00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:54,809
yeah so this was like the yeah the

00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:57,419
workflow you usually use and during the

00:17:54,809 --> 00:18:00,029
years I'm already working with swings I

00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:02,039
Internet I discovered a few things that

00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:08,909
are helpful in the everyday work was

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:12,419
international I days documentation so if

00:18:08,909 --> 00:18:14,070
you use code inside your documentation

00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:19,019
here's a snippet of template code for

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:21,869
example um you should be um yeah you

00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:23,340
should careful and always use English

00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:26,399
inside these code examples because

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,570
otherwise if example use German here and

00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,970
something would be translated to

00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,739
japanese the Japanese people would have

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:32,970
a hard time understanding what the

00:18:31,739 --> 00:18:36,330
content of the template really is about

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,399
em they have been requests on these

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:42,119
wings mailing list to also translate

00:18:38,399 --> 00:18:44,460
code but this hasn't been decided on how

00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,070
to deal with that and if this is

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,340
possible because at the moment only like

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:51,960
v the the written text is extracted from

00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:56,070
the springs document and not the code of

00:18:51,960 --> 00:19:00,480
course another thing as there are

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:07,080
different ways to handle urs and rst you

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:09,389
can use the syntax above which puts you

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,940
are directly into the text and you can

00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:15,330
use the syntax below where an EDS is

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:17,700
used and if you use the alias version um

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:19,519
you are gets lost because it is not

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,200
longer part of the catalog and

00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,019
especially if this sentence is

00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,929
translated the name Tyson sources would

00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:29,609
be translated to PI Sinclair code or

00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:32,369
something similar in another language

00:19:29,609 --> 00:19:35,249
and so the name of the reference is lost

00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:38,879
and the UL can't be inserted so always

00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:41,340
put the UL inside your documentation so

00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:48,359
the translator czl and can translate

00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:53,960
this properly yeah other thing is you

00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,960
often want to refer to external URLs and

00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:00,140
often these you ads are referred to

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,049
referring to documentation which is

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:05,510
version like you see it's referring to

00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:09,049
Jenga documentation for 1.5 and if you

00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:11,659
then switch your documentation to refer

00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:13,010
to watching 1.6 you may want to I don't

00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:15,679
want to go to all of your documentation

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,570
and change it and especially not all the

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,789
translators want to go over all of their

00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,799
translators stuff to simply update the

00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:25,070
version number and they can use the

00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,990
feature of swings so the thing about the

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,549
dictionary X links is something from the

00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,590
swings configuration and they you define

00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:33,260
these a DSS and then as you can see

00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:35,809
below in your text you can simply easies

00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,690
a DSS as prefixes for then the rest of

00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:40,370
the URL and so you like magically can

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,190
construct these URLs and only have a

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:47,750
single point where you define the prefix

00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:51,380
on the left side and yeah and how to

00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:55,100
handle special cases there is a if

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:57,049
config construction in swings way always

00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,730
can check against the current language

00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,070
and so you can have an average

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,500
accommodation like special cases for

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,570
example here's a link to the German

00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,490
community and of course you want to have

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,929
this part of the documentation only in

00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,580
the German language are not on the other

00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:12,380
languages so you can always have like

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,820
some kind of special part of your

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:20,690
documentation only for a specific

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:22,250
language last tip is our how to run link

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:23,929
check stuff for example there is a link

00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,880
check target and also the link check

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:28,130
target and many other targets except

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:29,690
this language switch and Link check

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,390
simply goes over all your documentation

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,559
and check the URLs and of course you

00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,960
want to check you out for every language

00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:39,919
and so this is also possible with all

00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:44,270
the different languages yeah so what is

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,700
the missing um for example a translation

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,559
setting is missing so that you can build

00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,899
or translation with one come on at the

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,909
moment you have to execute all the steps

00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:54,080
for every single language and if you

00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:55,220
have a documentation of five hundred

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,169
languages is a lot of work you have to

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,179
do and so of course you want a

00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:00,230
translation setting its legacy language

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:02,299
with your written language and

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,919
translations is for other languages and

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:06,620
you can simply build all of them

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,670
together and whoa another thing that is

00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:10,480
missing is

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:16,490
a landing page for the HTML version

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:18,560
because yeah you need something like a

00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,110
page may refer to all the different

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,770
languages if someone comes to your page

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,540
radar HD may documentation is another

00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,340
optimization could be you to use gitex

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:32,360
compact to create a single catalog

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,250
instead of many catalogs and are the

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,230
rest is not that important I think we

00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,020
use rest of the time for at least a few

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:40,730
questions before time is up so thanks

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:42,790
for listening and please ask a few

00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,790
questions

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:58,280
okay QA this one microphone over there

00:22:51,530 --> 00:23:01,490
yeah hi thanks for the talk so if you

00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:03,770
have several source files and

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,170
documentation and you have choose to

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:12,380
have several catalog files but then you

00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:14,240
have a small words that occur in every

00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,210
file do you have to translate them in

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,780
every catalog file or are there shared

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:22,580
within once things right yeah yeah and I

00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,200
was thought about that maybe excluding

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,850
an example slide where i show how this

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,900
catalog looks like so I we should do

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:35,660
that um yeah so am with swings the

00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,970
always a full paragraph is extracted so

00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:40,730
you every paragraph is a single message

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,760
so you never have single words that can

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:46,700
be translated this is only true for the

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,210
index so in swings you can have an index

00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:52,010
of keywords where you then which is at

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,390
the head of the book which can link them

00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,920
to different parts of documentation and

00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:57,050
these index words are translated

00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:00,320
separately but all the other stuff is

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:05,810
simply translated paragraph but this was

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:15,140
your question okay yeah any other

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:17,180
questions I mean yeah also i'm available

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,550
all the day here and i'm here to

00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,620
saturday and on the sprint on saturday

00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:23,600
we will also have a sprint on swings so

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,150
if you have any ideas on how to optimize

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,680
staff or I don't know have any ask

00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,470
questions you can always come to us on

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,770
saturday and talk to us about improving

00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:36,620
swings would be happy to hear from you

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,920
