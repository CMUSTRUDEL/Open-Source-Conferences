[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

How to write multi-language documentation? What tools can you use? What mistakes should you avoid? This talk is based on the experiences I gathered while working on several multi-language documentation projects using Sphinx.

-----

Internationalized documentation is a fairly new topic. And there are different approaches to do this. I will talk about how Sphinx internationalization support works, which tools and services I use and how to organize the translation workflow in an Open Source project. Finally I will have a look at what the future of internationalization in Sphinx might bring.
