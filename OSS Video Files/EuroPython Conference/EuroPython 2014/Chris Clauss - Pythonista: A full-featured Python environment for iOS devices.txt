	Chris Clauss - Pythonista: A full-featured Python environment for iOS devices
[EuroPython 2014]
[22 July 2014]

The Pythonista app delivers a full-featured Python development experience on an iPad or an iPhone.  This introduction to the app will provide a rapid overview of the Pythonista user experience, features and Community Forum.  Then it will focus on a few source code examples of using the GPS to deliver real-time local weather, use the image library to manipulate images and convert documents, use the gyroscope to understand pitch, yaw, and roll, use Dropbox to backup and restore scripts, images, etc.

everybody welcome back again I'm Austin

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,670
Bingham from 60 North up in Norway I

00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:25,560
want to introduce Chris Klaus will be

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,240
talking about as you can read Python ISA

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:34,110
a full-featured Python environment for

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:37,770
iOS devices take it away hi folks my

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:41,059
name is Chris Klaus so I'm relatively

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,239
new to python I started computing on a

00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:49,770
64 kilobit Commodore machine way back in

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:51,690
the day so I've done basic COBOL RPG

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,020
languages you don't even know about

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,110
anymore I've also done a lot of Java I

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,690
work for son so working on Java worked

00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:03,300
for seven years for Apple doing

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,729
development there and now I work for IBM

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,430
and what I do for IBM is I do smarter

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,710
City software so i have a group of

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,070
architects who help customers do smarter

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,950
City software and at the end of the day

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,109
or on a long flight it's really fun to

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,670
just break out the ipad and hack in

00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:23,670
Python so that's what I'm going to try

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,840
and show you a little bit about a hobby

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:32,520
that I have on off hours hacking around

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:35,039
with Python on iOS devices so Python

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,409
Easter is written here in in berlin by a

00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,270
gentleman named Olli horn and I've never

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,060
met Olli I hope to meet him later today

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:45,450
for the first time but he writes two

00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,859
products he writes to iOS apps the first

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,439
one is called Python east and that's

00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:51,869
what today's focus is on the second one

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,240
also uses Python but it's it's much more

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:57,810
for workflows it's called editorial and

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,789
by workflows I mean I'm a blogger I go

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,999
to various conferences and I write blogs

00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,579
and I want to upload my blog I might

00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:07,649
want to do some editing of it I might

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,770
want to do all sorts of interactions on

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,610
the text convert it to PDF converted to

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,459
HTML convert it to whatever format and

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,930
editorials really slick for that so I

00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,430
personally gravitate towards Python

00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,239
Easter because it's really about writing

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,280
Python and living in Python but lots of

00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,350
editorial type folks people who deal a

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,330
lot with text

00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,670
documents love editorial and love its

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,650
workflow so I'll focus mostly on Python

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:35,360
east of today i'll try to show you a

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,110
little bit of editorial if we have time

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,930
later so just just a little bit about

00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:45,530
what we're going to talk about what i

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:48,350
wanted to do was focus in on on this

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,950
particular issue that apple puts a lot

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:53,900
of constraints on developers who want to

00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,480
develop applications which are coding

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,340
platforms for iOS devices their

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,030
principal worry is that you can download

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,370
scripts that can change the change the

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,260
machine and so there's a lot of

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,480
constraints around being able to

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,590
download code into an environment like

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,110
Python esta and upload code and so there

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,730
have been times in the past when Haifa

00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,640
nista has been booted out of the app

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,980
store by Apple because it sort of

00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,160
crossed the lines and so we play a very

00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,260
delicate game as a community trying to

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,690
make sure that what we do with Python

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,820
nista doesn't go beyond apples

00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,010
guidelines or they actually take the app

00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,500
out of the App Store so very interesting

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:38,420
last thing we have a really strong

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,370
community with a community forum and

00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,710
I'll show you a little bit of that the

00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,450
internet here is lousy so I'm not going

00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,020
to show you it live but I'm actually a

00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:49,280
little bit of the UI there's also

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,950
specific modules that have been put into

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,980
Python Easter for dealing with iOS

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,840
things like graphics and sound and

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,750
things like that but also for dealing

00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,010
with third-party things like Dropbox so

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,900
I'll talk to you a little bit about that

00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,050
and I'm really going to try to focus

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:10,610
most of it on showing you actual apps

00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:12,470
running and okay so that's the main web

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,740
page for Python east again you get the

00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,830
idea it's a Python environment it's on

00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:21,020
Python 2 dot 7 dot 6 running on iOS

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,320
devices and yes you can run this on your

00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:26,870
your iPhone yes you can run this on your

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,320
iPod so um yeah it's a it's a full

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:33,470
environment and it's got a great code

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,600
editor to it that lets you edit code on

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,700
the device but also if you have a

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,350
bluetooth keyboard

00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,240
lots of the people in the community use

00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,730
a separate bluetooth keyboard and that's

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,410
the way they enter their text it's got

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:48,860
modules for graphics and touch that I'll

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:51,980
show you and it's got just recently

00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,680
added numpy and math Platt lives so I'll

00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,290
try and show you those and it's now got

00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,620
you a GUI tool kit so you can build an

00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:03,590
application with a graphic designer that

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:07,430
looks and feels like a real iOS app like

00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:11,330
to an iOS user you can actually put that

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:13,520
into the Apple code tool and then you

00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,250
can upload it to the apple app library

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,710
so you can make a full feature running

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,590
app that looks like a mac at our an iOS

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:27,110
app on your ipad and you can put it in

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:29,780
the Apple App Store ok so the docs are

00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,460
all online they're also all in the ipad

00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,590
so that's a beautiful thing if you're on

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:35,930
a plane and you forget about some

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,630
standard library function call or you

00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:41,030
forget about some module that Olli has

00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:43,310
provided in the tool that's always

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,520
online so I'll show you that it's a full

00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:48,800
feature 276 there's very few things that

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,530
that are a little bit special about it

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:57,140
but it's really a full featured on 276

00:05:53,530 --> 00:06:00,170
it also includes these special modules

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:02,030
that are specific to to dealing with the

00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,850
iOS things like I'm knowing your

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:07,490
location doing reverse geocoding which

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:10,430
is really beautiful so um take take the

00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:13,370
the location of this device and turn it

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:17,330
into an address so I know the street

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:20,140
address of the device at any moment 2d

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,630
graphics in a thing called seen on

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:26,630
sounds speech and then this new UI

00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:29,540
component that lets me create real you I

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:32,450
on the iPad that looks and feels like

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,850
any other iPad f um but there's tools

00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:37,970
like I'm clipboard and editor lets me

00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:41,360
get at at the clipboard of the value as

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,190
device and at the editor of the text

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,070
that I'm dealing with so I can actually

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:50,210
manipulate that the text of the editor

00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:51,210
in inside keychain for for passwords and

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,870
things like that

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:56,940
I'm and next up there's some extra

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,190
modules that are just great things to

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,449
have like beautiful super and requests

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:05,460
and these are just modules that our lots

00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:07,710
of users want and so wholly includes

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,970
them the difficult thing about this

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,740
platform is it's not really ready for

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,599
downloading modules like like you might

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,580
be used to on your Mac or your your

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,550
windows box right so you can't just go

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,319
out to pi PI and download modules into

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,979
your device the community has done a

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,590
pretty good job of letting you down load

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:31,650
modules that are pure python but if

00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:34,139
modules include see you're really gotta

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:37,259
work hard to get them into into the into

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,090
this environment so again he includes

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:41,180
lots of good libraries right out of the

00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:43,949
out of the box which are quite useful in

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:47,900
particular the dropbox functionality is

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:50,550
really a lifesaver in some instances

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,880
okay and then last but not least there's

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,310
a really active on community so this is

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,229
a snapshot of the community this morning

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,050
on some of these just uploaded a new

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,360
game that they want to show off to

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,610
people and get them to collaborate on

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,409
the second one down here he's tried to

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,969
rotate text and he's having trouble and

00:08:07,409 --> 00:08:12,090
he's asking questions in the community

00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:14,820
so a really active community one around

00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,250
Python e1 around Titan ease to one

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:19,800
around to editorial that are there

00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:21,240
really really useful and then last but

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,599
not least that the community has

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,300
relatively recently created a Python

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,630
Ystad tools on github this is really a

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,060
collection of code that's been specific

00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:36,450
specifically built on top of Python

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:41,070
Easter and so it lets the community

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:43,740
point to tools and get collaboration

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,899
around those tools so through through

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,750
through github we have multiple people

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:52,920
editing up tools games whatever they

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:55,470
might be on the platform there's other

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,450
pythons on the iOS and so I thought it

00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,209
would be useful to to just talk about

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:03,520
those I think by and large these are

00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:06,460
things that are useful to steer clear of

00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:08,350
with maybe one or two exceptions so um

00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,690
editorial as I've mentioned is the

00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,180
sister product and you know I really

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:16,120
encourage you to look at it in addition

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,700
to python East ax um this this new one

00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:23,110
is called computable and it's just come

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:26,230
out it is a it is an I Python

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:29,080
implementation that hazmat ply lab and

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:32,950
numpy and all that good stuff this one

00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:34,450
is looking good but it's 1.01 right i

00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:38,860
mean it's it's brand new to the market

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,770
so comes out of austria and the the

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,770
Creator has been a been contributor to

00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:47,170
the the place lanista community and now

00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:48,730
has come up with this new thing so it'll

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,460
be interesting to see the dynamic

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,980
between computable and Python East ax I

00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,620
think those are really that the two to

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,720
look at in this space on the other ones

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:06,430
come from various places around the

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:08,140
world ones that I really it they look

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,730
interesting but they're very long in the

00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,280
tooth and they haven't been supported in

00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,050
many years so I'm really though there's

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,000
other ones out there but but these are

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,800
the ones I recommend all right and so

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,330
last but not least this is sort of what

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:24,700
it looks like i have a list of files on

00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:27,460
the left i have the file i'm currently

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:30,460
working on on the right and that's my

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:37,270
last slide so from now on we're just

00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:42,100
going to live inside python easton okay

00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:44,500
um so this um this simple file um just

00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,120
um uses the speech library and so what I

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,530
thought I'd show you is that there's a

00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,750
thing called speech are you talking to

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,900
me are you talking to me okay I you

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,650
talking to me and if you know you know

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:59,770
taxi driver it might make sense so I'm

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:02,350
so that's uh that's just a simple module

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:05,920
that oles built into the tool that lets

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,070
me take arbitrary text and pump it

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,230
through a speech a text-to-speech engine

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:13,600
it can take multiple languages and it's

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,080
very flexible but sometimes just useful

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,290
and fun okay so first and foremost

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,910
let's start with console so so it's got

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:25,720
a standard console like you might be

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:38,260
used to and so if we go over to the

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:40,440
console I can type stuff here okay

00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:44,590
standard console that you're all used to

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:49,980
but I can also do I can also do graphics

00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:52,330
to the console so let me take a simple

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:55,570
mathematical formula that draws a star

00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:59,020
and let me draw to the console so i can

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:01,210
draw either graphics or pump text into

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,600
the console and again it's a standard

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:16,690
Python console there you used to so let

00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:21,910
me clear that okay next up it there is a

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:25,810
module that lets me that lets me do a

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:28,540
bit more sophisticated graphics it came

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:31,330
after the console graphics and it's

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:37,330
called scene and so scene is basically I

00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:39,670
get to use the iOS visual display and

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:43,600
and do various things with it so i'll

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,070
show you a few of these so when i create

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,320
a scene i can either create it in

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:50,320
landscape or portrait right because that

00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,240
the device can turn and um if I do it

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,700
right I can create it such that a game

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,070
or or anything else could respond to

00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,900
turns right so that my game could play

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,700
the way I'm so first I'm going to show

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:04,390
you a game called cloud jump that was

00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,730
initially put up on the forum and people

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,280
sit you know the author said hack at it

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,040
tell me what you think so the problem

00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:15,250
for us is well for me is that it's

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:20,550
sideways I'm tilted right so I'm going

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:20,550
to play um if I can

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,760
even second okay um

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,490
so now it is tilting up but I'm gonna

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:55,500
I'm gonna play cloud jump she meant stay

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:58,529
connected you guys got that it's it's

00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,420
it's it's one of those you know on the

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:02,370
iOS devices you always pick something

00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:04,589
that's geographically close to each

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,140
other they're not exactly secure

00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,990
passwords there's only okay so cloud

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,910
jump lets me bounce off of clouds and if

00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:14,820
it's playing for you you can see that it

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,839
lets me know high score no sounds no

00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,550
nothing okay so great great nice tool

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:23,070
that a guy actually built with this

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:25,019
young child together they built this as

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,940
a programming exercise and he's actually

00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,060
built three or four of these games um

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,970
jumpy octopus and there's a x times

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,399
table torture that so he's created these

00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,800
games with his kids so he put it up on

00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,350
the community and let the community have

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,230
at it what the community did was add

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:48,660
high scores ed sounds add the ability to

00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:50,130
play in either direction etc etc so if I

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:55,550
got a high score I got to give it my

00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:58,170
name and it's a different game it's got

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:01,980
monsters it's got a different character

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:06,570
i can pick my character etc and so now

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,399
it's got sounds and if I die it's got

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:12,390
explosions all those sorts of fun things

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,579
so um again through through the through

00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,250
the joys of github and open community

00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:19,170
people can take something that started

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:24,089
as simple make it better and better

00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:27,329
better and better together so a lot of

00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:29,670
what I do on use it for is things

00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:32,130
related to my work so again my work is

00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:34,589
about smarter cities and I work with

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,810
cities all around the globe trying to

00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:39,449
help them figure out how to use data

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,100
about their city to deal with problems

00:15:39,449 --> 00:15:43,980
like water and transportation and public

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,590
safety and things like that a huge trend

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,120
in cities is open data where city

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,460
are taking their data and they're

00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,260
publishing it to developers and letting

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:54,540
the developers to run while to build

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,120
apps and so a lot of what my work has

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,730
been about is about showing people the

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,010
art of the possible so here what I've

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:06,150
done is I've taken for data sets and I

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:10,110
have formats for them and I let people

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:13,470
go out and create create extracts of

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:16,140
those data sets that are then stored

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:18,060
locally so again I'm going to go out to

00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,470
a city's open data I'm going to grab a

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,420
couple data sets that I want to deal

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,220
with I'm going to get on an airplane and

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,000
I going to whack at it with none plot

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:29,580
and um plot num num pie and a mat plot

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,480
line right so this is a way for me to

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:36,480
deal with disconnectedness of I want

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,890
open data and I got the tools but I'm on

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,100
an airplane and the airplane doesn't

00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:43,110
have Wi-Fi so a simple simple app that

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:47,550
I'd run for you if we actually had good

00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,200
internet here but we don't to grab data

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:53,550
sets and put them into a format that can

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,200
be used for for that plot line um the

00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:58,410
other thing that that I do around

00:16:55,200 --> 00:17:00,540
smarter cities is we actually sell a

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,940
tool and that tool helps people run

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:05,370
traffic or water public safety or

00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:09,720
complex stuff that tool has a REST API

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:13,290
and so what i can do is build into my

00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,140
ipad the ability to talk to some huge

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:20,459
system out in the cloud and use that

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:24,240
rest api so here i have a really nice

00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:26,160
graphics rich platform that i can create

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,480
a really slick dashboard for the mayor

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,330
or for the guy who runs the

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,640
transportation office and I have a

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,280
pretty simple straightforward way to go

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,770
to a REST API and pull out all sorts of

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,740
real-time data about traffic as it's

00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:43,010
going to be an hour in the future or

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,660
where the leaks in my water system etc

00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:48,300
so again I'd show you those but the

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,220
internet here is lousy let me talk to

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,720
you one last thing about seen and that

00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:58,040
is um color so this is called tilting

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,590
color and basically the idea is that

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm looking at the pitch yaw and roll of

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:05,990
the ipad so I have a sensor in the ipad

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,720
that tells me the pitch John roll and I

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:11,630
can change the color okay this was just

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,720
to prove that we could build demos and

00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,090
games around pity on roll but it's a

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,890
simple demonstration of what i can do

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,320
with the scene so a very short piece of

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,660
code just grabs the pitch yaw and roll

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,470
and lets me play with it and show it off

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:29,000
on on the on the scene okay one of the

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,210
people in the community built a game of

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,670
life run this so i want to make sure

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:47,420
it's gonna okay I think I double tap I

00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:51,560
mean one second okay your standard game

00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:53,030
of life and again these things them go

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:57,320
up and then they get improved by the

00:18:53,030 --> 00:19:01,700
community the contacts module lets me go

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,710
into the address book of the of the the

00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,870
iOS device or I can go grab all my

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,240
contacts and do various manipulations of

00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,880
them on this code just goes out and

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,790
grabs on my contacts and uses the

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,830
geocoding to to give me their lat long

00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:19,580
of where they live so I take the address

00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:22,010
out of the address book and I use the

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,740
the geocoding to turn that into a level

00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:27,860
one so again really short piece of code

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,830
does on some some interesting things and

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:33,350
can be can be grown on recent tweet

00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:36,890
recent tweets dumb goes out to Twitter

00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:39,770
on and basically for a user tells me

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:43,790
what are their recent tweets so I can do

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:46,010
these sorts of things on that that you

00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:50,930
guys can write down that my mikey here

00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:53,870
if you want that I can go out and you

00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:56,330
know go to Twitter or do do lots of

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,210
screen scraping on sorts of things with

00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:04,280
with requests and beautiful soup and and

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:07,460
all those basic tools look let's talk a

00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:09,340
little bit about you I so so this is the

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:12,220
the UI tool that

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,310
that comes with that comes with the

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,340
package it lets me create all the things

00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:21,190
that you see here so i can create labels

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:23,380
and buttons and sliders and switches and

00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,360
calendar pickers and all the rest of the

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:28,270
usual stuff that people expect out of

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,280
iOS apps and basically what it will do

00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:35,380
is it will create a fly file that is

00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:40,510
called the p wat name dot p yui and so

00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:44,110
that p yui file really defines a user

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:46,990
interface and i can basically just load

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:50,020
in that file at startup time and i have

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:53,050
a UI that's ready cooked ready to build

00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,960
with or if i want i can build the UI

00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,090
piece by piece by piece in python you

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,060
have your choice some people seem to

00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:03,490
like that the design tool and laying out

00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,590
their UI and really making it nice and

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:08,200
then just sucking it all in as one piece

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,900
other people like to build it up piece

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,180
by piece by piece in python so let me

00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:17,200
just show you a little bit of what that

00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:22,270
looks like an actual reality so here you

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:24,070
can see i can add new new object and so

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,170
i can say that i want to create an

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:30,160
object i want to create sub views of

00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:33,400
that object etc etc so just a really

00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:37,510
slick slick little addition to to the

00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:41,050
tool whether where you are again was a

00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:43,180
simple simple tool that uses the

00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:46,540
geolocation of the current object and

00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:50,730
then uses an open data weather service

00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:50,730
called Weather Underground I believe

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,460
just trying to see no it's called open

00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,290
weather map open weather map torg so

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,540
again this tool just gets the geo

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,690
location of the device it turns that

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:07,420
into a city state country and then goes

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,540
out to the open weather maps org and

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,920
gets the current weather so it tells me

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,700
temperature pressure humidity sunrise

00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,580
sunset etc ok so again simple tools that

00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:21,150
get created quite rapidly that use on

00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,720
the sensors in the device either the

00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,169
location sensor

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,330
the pitch yaw roll sensor and the

00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:32,950
various the touch sensors the various

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:35,860
sensors inside the device and of course

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,659
there's the zenith python right so this

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,820
is another thing that's just rights to

00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:44,470
the console and as it's writing to the

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:48,630
console the import this text it it is

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,630
doing so I'm changing the color slightly

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:56,080
all right just trying to see if I

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:59,470
covered what I wanted to cover Oh Matt

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,130
plot live and numpy so I'm here is a

00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:05,020
plot out of matplotlib so if you're used

00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:07,750
to using these tools and know how to

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:10,720
make them go they're off here totally

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,880
functional and and quite quite useful

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,230
and powerful i think it's it's it's

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,900
created a lot of excitement in the

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:20,669
community having tracked on python for

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:23,650
iOS for a long time it was like really a

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,530
commonly requested thing to get it here

00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:29,470
and it's just come to market in the last

00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,600
four months so it's all in there and

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:35,470
people are really starting to go crazy

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,669
with it um it doesn't have the the pipe

00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:40,120
in East environment doesn't have a

00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:43,510
search tool to search all the files so I

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:46,809
can do that so I created my own and

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:49,510
basically what it does is it goes grabs

00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:53,740
all the files and looks for it's like a

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:56,650
gret it brings up something that that's

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,480
useful so I can either tap this arrow at

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:01,900
the upper right corner of the screen to

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,120
run or I can tap and hold and if I tap

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:06,210
and hold it will let me give command

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,200
line parameters right so you gotta

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,640
usually when you're typing at the

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,760
command line you'd like to give your

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,549
Python App the script other command line

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:18,429
parameters so you can run with arguments

00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:21,400
and so this this tool will do that and

00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:26,020
bring the text up in in the editor with

00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,789
the text highlighted I think I've showed

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:32,640
you what I wanted to show you I'm open

00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:32,640
to questions go for it

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:50,910
doc utils let me see okay nope

00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:54,060
nope

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:11,520
go ahead um yeah there's a whole sound

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,680
um library so let me let me go there so

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,050
I this is good because it lets me show

00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,570
you what what it looks like to to be a

00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:22,020
developer on the environment so here's a

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:24,360
module called sound it's got samples and

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,640
whenever their samples I can actually

00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:31,020
open those samples in the text editor

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:34,020
right away and just run them okay so

00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:39,210
that plays a short melody and let me go

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:42,060
back solo defect play an effect stop in

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,340
effect and set volume there was also

00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,170
some undocumented features inside the

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,390
sound library that that parties are

00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,790
using so um that's another thing that

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:52,710
goes on in the community is people sort

00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:55,080
of go through the code and find

00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:57,030
undocumented features that that are

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:04,470
useful but a pretty straightforward

00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:06,870
simple sound library yes server

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,130
something portable is there any is

00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,320
anybody with something that's kind of a

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,320
layer above that it has the pilus driver

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:20,700
yep yeah so so not particularly for

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,570
sound but for other things I have seen

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:27,240
the community build up sort of a wrapper

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,530
around various libraries but but not for

00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,190
sound that I've seen there was a

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:31,190
question in the back

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:55,340
oh I'm sorry yeah no I'll repeat the

00:26:43,370 --> 00:27:10,250
questions I'm sorry yeah we base the red

00:26:55,340 --> 00:27:14,270
something how does it work okay but is

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:16,790
only work does not only work on the

00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:19,970
light that i can use it for example

00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:24,050
under my i say something awesome i was

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:25,670
saying it I think that okay so so first

00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:28,870
and foremost one thing I didn't show you

00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:31,670
is that I can put certain scripts into a

00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:34,340
actions menu right these are things that

00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,050
I do often one of those is dropboxing

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,020
and I'm just going to try a drop-back

00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:41,390
sync it probably won't work but maybe

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:44,210
the internets good enough umm so so

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,390
dropboxing lets me push my scripts into

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:51,200
dropbox i can then get on my windows box

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:53,870
or thankfully my my mac and and use

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,390
those use those scripts so moving things

00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,760
onto and off of your device can be done

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,920
through this this community built tool

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:03,140
that is built on top of the dropbox

00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:06,200
module the nice thing about that is i

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:10,520
can then dropbox ink on my iOS device am

00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:13,010
I my phone and I i have codebase synced

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,420
between my two iOS devices now your

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,060
question was different than that your

00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:20,000
question was how do i take the app that

00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:23,570
I've built here on my iPad and how do I

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,300
get it into the apple app store so so so

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,190
basically you what's the code tool that

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:31,670
Apple uses a caramel but it's called

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:35,720
Xcode there we go basically you take

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:38,870
your Python files and you put them into

00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:40,910
Xcode and then there's one script one

00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:44,930
python script that you need to run on

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:47,360
your Mac to create resources into into

00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,300
that project and then you build that

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,720
project

00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:55,620
it builds down to an iOS executable and

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:57,630
that iOS executable is something that

00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:00,780
you can put up on the App Store so again

00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:03,510
take the code from here and sync it to

00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:07,110
your Mac probably using dropbox sync but

00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:09,000
there's lots of ways second run this

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,510
script on your Mac which creates extra

00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,730
resources inside your Xcode project

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:16,710
compile your Xcode project and you have

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:34,650
an iOS app that's ready to go into the

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:36,210
iOS App Store I don't know the answer

00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:40,650
whether you can run it in the iOS

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:42,450
emulator on the Mac I just not familiar

00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:46,170
enough with that piece of the puzzle to

00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,880
say my suspicion is that it does not but

00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:49,880
I would need to check that

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,210
yeah so so that's an awesome point it's

00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:18,120
it's really really hard to develop on an

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:20,490
iOS device on a touchscreen but we've

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,279
seen people build really complex games

00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:26,190
on an iPhone they sit on the bus every

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,620
day on the ride home from work and over

00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:31,289
ten days they built a really complex app

00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,629
on their iphone so it's a really small

00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:36,450
screen with really teeny editor and all

00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:38,610
the line wrapping problems they have but

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:41,070
I gotta tell you that the majority of

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,700
the serious people who really do work on

00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:47,850
on Python ease to use an external

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,769
keyboard it's like essential I actually

00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:57,779
don't I don't use an external keyboard

00:30:49,769 --> 00:31:00,210
but most people do so um yeah I think

00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:04,320
you're right that that that it's hard to

00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:06,330
to develop on the on the iOS device

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,850
alone and not be able to emulate on the

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:10,289
mac and again I just don't know the

00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:21,090
answer whether that's doable or not

00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:23,129
doable I just don't know yeah yeah all

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,070
that stuff so the question was can you

00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:28,320
can you access excel files in JSON and

00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:30,330
all that stuff yeah the standard JSON

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,029
libraries in there you know reading

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:35,610
through files is really easy and and

00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:39,809
actually you know if you really love

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:42,179
file manipulation Jeff definitely check

00:31:39,809 --> 00:31:45,720
out editorial too because editorial has

00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:48,330
has work flow to it that that pipe in

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,389
Ystad doesn't for for making that that

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:53,850
easier there's also lots of conversion

00:31:51,389 --> 00:31:56,129
capabilities like I want to convert this

00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:58,049
whole thing to a PDF or I want to

00:31:56,129 --> 00:32:01,379
convert this whole thing back into Excel

00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:03,899
so there's lots of lots of good code

00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:04,800
snippets and work done by the community

00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:07,580
to do

00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:12,540
so look let me show you two more things

00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:14,610
so this is compu table this this is not

00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,420
created by Olli it's it's sort of a

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:21,570
competing product it is an I Python

00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:24,600
implementation for the ipad and so

00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:28,740
basically you know the full type ipython

00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,680
story but but you know reformat it to

00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:36,780
work work here and I'm just going to

00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:39,330
open up a going to open up a book

00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:42,090
whatever they call those and here you

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:45,020
can see on all the usual things you'd

00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:49,080
expect from a from an eye Python world

00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:51,210
he's giving you some samples where you

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:54,990
know he shows you how he computed the

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:57,990
logo of the app itself and so so again

00:32:54,990 --> 00:33:01,080
there's a there's that tool which if

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:03,690
you're into ipython and that sort of

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,360
style I would definitely recommend and

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:15,060
then last but not least let me show you

00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:17,400
editorial which might be here andit

00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:21,980
oriole is created by Olli so it's the

00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:25,590
sister product to to to python East ax

00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:28,530
and you'll see it looks up a bit

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:31,770
different let me just see if I can find

00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:34,350
one of these you can see that it's got

00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:37,560
more of the ipython look and feel where

00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:41,370
I where I can create a user interface

00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:46,070
that that feels like a web page but it's

00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:49,950
got more tasks and is more task oriented

00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:51,840
and again based on sort of let's let's

00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,490
deal with mark down first and foremost

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,760
but let's deal with lots of other file

00:33:53,490 --> 00:34:05,940
formats in addition other comments

00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:09,060
questions and issues I'm a big champion

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:14,610
of that I'm a big believer in that so

00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:18,389
far the really the only Python 3 that I

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:21,779
know of is really in the other packages

00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:24,119
that I don't really recommend so I got

00:34:21,779 --> 00:34:28,169
to say that there isn't a great Python 3

00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:30,029
on iOS today we bug and pest Rowley

00:34:28,169 --> 00:34:32,549
about it but but for him it's it's a

00:34:30,029 --> 00:34:34,769
biggie right so a lot of people say they

00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:37,649
want a single app that's got Python 3

00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:39,149
and Python 2 but if you think about that

00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,829
that's really really hard from a

00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:42,510
developer's perspective and from a

00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:44,159
user's perspective first from the

00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:46,559
developer's perspective he's got to have

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,809
two sets of docs two sets of standard

00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:51,059
libraries two sets of worries and

00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:53,579
debugging in an environment that does

00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:55,409
both is really hard the other the other

00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,049
way to go is to create two separate apps

00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,089
where he's got you know python easter to

00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:02,130
and played the nice two three and and

00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:04,799
you know the the thing that he says over

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,809
and over again is it's a disruptive

00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:08,400
break for the for the users you know

00:35:06,809 --> 00:35:11,609
it's going to create a whole lot more

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,170
questions on the forum about I this used

00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:14,250
to work and now it doesn't work and I

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,559
don't understand the difference between

00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,690
Python 2 and Python 3 there's still a

00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:21,569
lot of quandary in the community so um

00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:25,380
right now um you know computable is

00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:29,069
Python 2 dot 7 dot one python east and

00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:31,109
editorial or two dot 7 dot six we're

00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:42,990
just not there with a great with a great

00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:44,970
python3 just yet go for it not well so

00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,609
so i can use dropbox sync in two

00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:51,299
directions right so i can do that trick

00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:53,849
i can mail myself things right pick them

00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:56,039
up and put them in that way there's lots

00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:59,519
of ways in and out there's um you know

00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:02,039
lots of different methods to get texts

00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:05,759
in i can go screens great but i can use

00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:08,849
requests or you you are a lib to suck in

00:36:05,759 --> 00:36:10,859
text there's lots and lots of ways to to

00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:13,140
get things there's also a great set of

00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:16,049
tools that he didn't talk about that let

00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,329
me go at github right so you know get

00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:21,029
get checked basically lets me check

00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:23,819
something into github and retrieve

00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:25,799
things from github there's another thing

00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:27,450
for dropbox that's much more of a user

00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:29,660
interface where I pick the file that I

00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:32,349
want and I just suck in that one file

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:35,680
yeah there's lots of ways to get things

00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:49,359
into and out of github and Dropbox and

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:52,470
and other techniques yeah so the this so

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,729
the question is about remote requests

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:57,160
this is where we start crossing the

00:36:54,729 --> 00:36:59,559
lines that get Apple very nervous so so

00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,440
right now Apple doesn't love Python

00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:04,509
anyway because python has got some new

00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:05,950
momentum that scares them a little bit

00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:08,109
and they're really trying to get people

00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:10,059
to Swift right there they're trying to

00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,859
say okay we told you the answer was

00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:14,619
Objective C but we were only kidding the

00:37:11,859 --> 00:37:15,970
answers now Swift and people are

00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:18,970
scratching their head about do they

00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:21,640
really want swift or not so they're

00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:25,269
really really trying to use this on this

00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,059
idea that mobile code is a dangerous

00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:29,829
idea right now I came from after I

00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:31,839
worked at Apple i worked at sun so i

00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:34,119
don't believe that mobile code is a bad

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,920
idea I believe that mobile code with the

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,079
right security and the right sandbox and

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,779
the right understanding is is sort of

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,960
vital to what to what we need to do in a

00:37:40,779 --> 00:37:48,269
modern computing platform but I can tell

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,829
you that that when we cross that line of

00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:53,619
doing things automatically where we

00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:55,359
automatically bring executable content

00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:58,599
into the environment and execute it

00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:01,029
without the users Authority or oversight

00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,619
or watching Apple gets really nervous

00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:04,180
and when Apple gets nervous they

00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:07,719
actually take the app out of the app

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:09,910
store right so that that has happened in

00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:13,119
a habit has happened again very recently

00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:15,130
so it's it's a line that that is

00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:17,559
difficult to cross they really don't

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:23,249
want mobile code that happens without

00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:23,249
user authorization and physical clicking

00:38:25,289 --> 00:38:33,239
know exactly an email that all works

00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,239
that all works go for it

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:43,290
is there a way to use a version control

00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:45,620
system in the iOS it depends on whether

00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:53,580
you call github a version control system

00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:56,250
no I mean so so so so this is this is

00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:58,760
not a replacement for your your pc or

00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,320
your windows box or your linux box and

00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,900
some of the complex things that you can

00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:07,320
do and just love on those devices you

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,270
don't have here you could probably put

00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,400
something together but is it there today

00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:17,300
no it's not but join the community and

00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,300
help us out one minute last question yep

00:39:28,730 --> 00:40:09,420
yep and you'll seal still in developing

00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:11,700
but it's yep yeah definitely been

00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,440
hearing lately about kitty and people

00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,240
saying it's really cool you can put

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,400
stuff together really fast with it I'm

00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,230
pretty interesting platform so take a

00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,400
look thanks a lot for your time it's

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,400
been a real pleasure to speak with you

00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,300
