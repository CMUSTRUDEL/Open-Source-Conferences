[22 July 2014]

The Pythonista app delivers a full-featured Python development experience on an iPad or an iPhone.  This introduction to the app will provide a rapid overview of the Pythonista user experience, features and Community Forum.  Then it will focus on a few source code examples of using the GPS to deliver real-time local weather, use the image library to manipulate images and convert documents, use the gyroscope to understand pitch, yaw, and roll, use Dropbox to backup and restore scripts, images, etc.
