	Maciej/Fabrizio Romano - Python Driven Company
[EuroPython 2014]
[25 July 2014]

Adopting Python across a company brings extra agility and productivity not provided by traditional mainstream tools like Excel. This is the story of programmers teaching non-programmers, from different departments, to embrace Python in their daily work.

-----

By introducing ipython notebook, pandas and the other data analysis packages that make python even more accessible and attractive, we attempted to adapt python as a core technology across our whole company. We’ve challenged the dominant position of Microsoft Excel and similar tools, and dared to replace it by pandas-powered ipython notebooks.

During this transitional phase, we have been inspired and sometimes forced to develop multiple packages that extend pandas, numpy etc., in order to enable our colleagues, in other departments, to access all the data they need. Moreover, we are developing several high level functionalities for the notebook environment. 

The notebook environment is allowing us to be extremely responsive to the changes our users are asking for, since, for part of the work, we don’t have to go through the whole traditional development process.

The talk focuses on challenges and problems we’ve solved and managed in order to achieve our long term goal of creating highly agile, data-driven non-tech teams, free from the constraints imposed by mainstream technologies, and all of this thanks to python.

okay so here with us are Fabrizio and ma

00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,290
che we are going to tell us about their

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:33,510
Python driven company so please give a

00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:35,489
warm round of applause hello hello

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,970
everyone I'm much it that's for breacher

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,320
and here's the rest of the team from tbg

00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,140
the company that we're presenting today

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,879
so it's not our companies we just work

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:51,210
for them but so um what the pie driven

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,190
company is about so basically and we

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,899
were challenged with quite a big problem

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,449
at some point in our career while

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,940
working at tpg and the solution that we

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:06,060
found was actually branded by us as a

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:08,850
Python driven company so um before talk

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:11,100
to them sorry okay so before we actually

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,050
starts taking you through all of the

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,200
challenges that we have to meet let me

00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:19,799
actually tell you the story that we were

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,009
fighting with so what was the challenge

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,560
so we are quite a modest-sized team it's

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,220
only five of us three developers it's

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,060
here and those three guys and basically

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:34,979
three developers one QA and scrum master

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,469
and then our management came to us and

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,360
saying hey guys by the way so would you

00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:41,250
be able to provide some tools for the

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,670
managing management of data a producing

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,590
report and helping to do the statistical

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,259
inference and help all the bunch of our

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,180
analyst that no actually nothing about

00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,219
programming they actually would like to

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,960
have shiny new eyes and they're quite a

00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:56,490
lot of them they have some people from

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,979
finance actually they would need your

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,810
help as well there are people also even

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,880
in HR that would be nice if you could

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,100
help them as well so then we just looked

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,570
at each other just just doing the simple

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,160
counting from one two three four five

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,120
and then just realizing that it's

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:17,070
actually a little bit too much for us by

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,890
the way we started quite a lot of new

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:21,810
features new actually projects and we

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,540
started to move to the area that was

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,160
kind of unknown to the company so when

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,500
it comes to specs so we had this

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,000
incredible requirement this point number

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,130
two and the

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,020
second point was actually like we really

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,330
don't know what the specs are so be

00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,820
prepared for everything which is quite

00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:39,770
easy if you have five people and please

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,390
deliver frequently naturally and of

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:43,310
course quality furs so when you deliver

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,750
an application that would be nice from

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,880
management point of view to deliver the

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,530
highest quality possible so we started

00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,270
to scratch our heads and saying like em

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:51,680
should we actually look for a job and

00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:56,510
actually should we actually take that

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,190
challenge so so now the big challenge so

00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,730
we actually started to think about how

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:04,100
we could a project and the first thing

00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:06,230
is actually we started to think about

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,910
the basic foundation of walking in in

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:11,060
any company because we realize that

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:12,830
actually so there is no way that will be

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,780
capable of delivering reach you I

00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,420
application that will help automate some

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,090
of the task of the people that will

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,280
actually make their life much easier

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,080
it's simply not enough of us and simply

00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,850
we don't have enough time and we won't

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,880
be able to fulfill all the points that I

00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,190
just outlined a few seconds ago so we

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:39,950
ask ourself alright so what's the

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:42,799
current so we asked ourselves was the

00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,030
current and structure of a company and

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,130
then we realize that actually the

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,380
structure of companies is even though we

00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:50,810
use all the age of all the buzz words of

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,260
the squirm inside the tech teams we are

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,000
pretty isolated units so basically if

00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,310
you think about it you have a big guy in

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,230
the middle and surrounded by small

00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,360
managers and then of course you have a

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,940
team's themselves so basically if you

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,430
want to automate or make a life automate

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,530
some of the tasks of the guys that are

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,000
doing the main work that are doing

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,950
actually the heavy lifting we should go

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,079
to them so we shouldn't actually rely on

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,140
the usual communication channels we

00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,060
should actually think about the

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,310
structure of a company like that so the

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,410
first impression that you can have is

00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,880
actually so this is like one big mess so

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,220
please imagine that each color

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,470
represents people coming from the and

00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,040
different apartment and of course color

00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:37,000
in is the size indicates importance of a

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,130
given person in a car key of the company

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,700
so detecting actually should be blended

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,500
into the

00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,390
scape of a company so we thought how

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,710
about we actually go to people on top of

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,150
them and just ask them like all right

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,250
what do you actually need right now

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,410
what's your problem like we don't want

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,930
to know like what is like a high level

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:58,350
specs of actually you know like an very

00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,260
advanced application that maybe in few

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:05,070
months having the team of this size will

00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,480
be able of delivering so then we started

00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,120
to ask even more questions to ourselves

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,800
for the others in order to define our

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
approach so the first question is like

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,620
could we find a platform that would

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,750
combine flexibility of white and

00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,840
awesomeness of the web tools so why we

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,670
actually decided to ask Python oriented

00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,920
questions because the first thing we

00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:24,300
realize no you I all right we went to

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,370
our management to say you want to have

00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,770
those tools let's forget about you is

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,930
all right no user interface is not no

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,610
graphical user interfaces so they say

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,470
like all right so how can you interact

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,910
with with with the platforms with the

00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,210
application we said you know we can code

00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:42,420
and it's like whoa but but wait a second

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:44,250
like those people know nothing about

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,650
coding says like all right so that's

00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,560
another challenge will teach them so so

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:51,540
basically we just realize how about we

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,550
use ipython notebook where they can

00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,500
actually you know inside those really

00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,960
shiny cells put some of the snippets

00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,090
share those snippets share the solution

00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,010
automate their work and we can by being

00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:04,800
blended into the company actually help

00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:06,750
them at the em every every stage of the

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,580
development so actually we thought we'll

00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:11,100
provide some high-level tools and they

00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,440
will provide more of them so in other

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,900
words will go with the mash-up kind of

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,200
approach and suddenly our development

00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,540
team actually exploded to tens of people

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,190
because it's not five of us anymore but

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,690
if they will gain even like a slight

00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:29,520
knowledge of whiten danica actually

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,870
build some apps for themselves and some

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,060
of the questions that they were asking

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,800
and some of the struggling god that they

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:37,350
were having was mostly mainly data

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,240
oriented so this is the world of EXO so

00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:42,180
Microsoft Excel is like ruling the world

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,890
of any analysis and the biggest problem

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,960
that they had with the big data they

00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:47,910
were already calling a big data is that

00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,100
that not capable of opening the XO files

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,870
because they are just too big so they

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,400
already arrived to the world of big data

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,800
and we said like alright so the first

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,290
solution that we deliver was called v3

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,030
analytically interface so so here is

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,770
just very primitive and simple snippet

00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,230
but actually this is all you need in

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:08,770
order to fetch quite a lot like around

00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:11,140
half a gigabyte of data and of course we

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,080
don't the user do not have to know

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,430
basically what we are using at the back

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,770
end whether it's whether it's

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,990
postgres how we actually transform those

00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,040
data how we actually deliver them they

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:22,810
don't need to know all the parameters

00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,450
they just say like all right so I have

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:28,450
this data store which is like name of my

00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,310
client let's say company a and they say

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:32,470
fetch me data out that and of course

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,260
they will fetch the data in the form of

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:39,310
data frame so it's already more of axial

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:42,160
world so so basically we set and when

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,420
you have the data that you just fetched

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,350
using three lines of codes you can

00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:50,860
either export them to excel or perform

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:53,320
your analysis in the notebook itself so

00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,290
and they actually interact with some of

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,480
the services and and and they ask us

00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,460
like is it possible actually to automate

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,950
those so we deliver them few solutions

00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,290
that enable them to just interact with

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,510
the services not only to fetch data and

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,130
do the usual transformations but

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,920
actually to to interact with the

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:14,980
services to post some of the service in

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:17,110
the server related platforms to actually

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,880
fetch the results to combine them and so

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,400
on and at the end and and of course as

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,290
always we provided like a backhand for

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,880
storing and the data ok did the biggest

00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,590
challenge that actually and Fabricio

00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,300
will tell you about was actually to

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,670
teach them that all so we provided the

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,530
high level and interfaces of programming

00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:38,140
interfaces so that i could just log into

00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:40,030
the software that we exposed to them for

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:42,750
hosting the notebooks they could

00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,340
actually just go there but what to type

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,740
so not so in order actually to achieve

00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,130
that the first i was like maybe we will

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,780
try this guy and it being crazy enough

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,070
to teach them python programming or

00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:57,330
maybe we need someone with superpowers

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,330
and established

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:03,310
so um but that's what's totally not easy

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,260
so maybe this story that I'm telling you

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,029
right now is like it sounds trivial and

00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:08,680
actually when I presenting to a slice

00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,960
and felt like oh it is it actually a

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:13,180
good topic to present during Europe item

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,760
because we are saying like a we just

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,980
decided to teach programming to a bunch

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,020
of non-programmers but please remember

00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,720
that they have no association whatsoever

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:26,649
with anything programming related like

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,480
anything so all right so the thing that

00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,700
we had to actually keep in mind all the

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,260
time was wise and house so in other

00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,540
words it's not only to show them the

00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:36,790
snippets and show like hey this will be

00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,290
super useful you need to reinforce this

00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,720
idea that this would be actually useful

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,089
and helpful all the time every single

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,130
small step like hey this is how you can

00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:47,410
automatically take all get you all of

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:49,420
your data do the analysis and that's

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,399
faster than than any other solution that

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,500
you know then for instance you can use

00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,020
this in this library to draw stuff to

00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,550
actually plot some things then you can

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,100
use this and that to actually produce

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,950
your reports so by simply just

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,860
introducing those those elements of the

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:10,330
usual pipeline we were able to enforce

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:12,279
those hows and whys at the same time and

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,350
the other problem was and realized that

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,570
we realize that we got it for free is

00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,920
that the usual question that we are

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,360
getting from them can you say that in

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,920
plain English so in other words like

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,390
they were coming with some problem they

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,910
were like I'll try need a problem like

00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:27,550
using their hand waving and then just

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:29,830
high level and attempts we were giving

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,510
them response answer to that and there

00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,950
is an anchor whoa could you say that in

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:34,810
plain English actually because I didn't

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,880
get that so then we thought if we will

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,290
teach them python python is a language

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,440
we know its programming language but

00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:43,870
let's stick to only to the language as a

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
buzzword let's use it let's actually

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:48,520
treat Python as a foreign language so if

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,350
you have a problem draft your problem in

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,540
the notebook and use the language that

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,600
we really understand and then we'll

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,670
deliver your solution much faster and of

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,450
course dealing with big data as I

00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:04,660
already mentioned let's use Python again

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:06,339
and if you combine their knowledge if

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,470
you actually introduce the multitasking

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:10,980
of the pattern that we are all aware of

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:13,030
they are just starting to

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,880
just discover totaling it from a

00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:17,880
different world okay so naturally they

00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:20,290
were like lots of people being like

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,640
incredible non-believers while lazy

00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,710
didn't want to actually engage

00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,420
themselves in something new and they

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,430
will keep challenging class with some

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,860
problems so for instance like yeah you

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:31,660
know there's this notebook and they were

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:34,090
using this special tone of voice while

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,970
asking those questions so I can I pull

00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:39,130
my data using notebook yes use request

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:42,190
or whatever like is it possible to

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:45,190
scribe website so of course they were

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:48,720
always waiting for this no saying like

00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,920
okay our system have limitations so but

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,530
they never asked actually the right

00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,720
question so naturally it is possible to

00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:58,030
scrape website naturally request scrapie

00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,820
whatever can i pee what my data pandas

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,670
can i create plots yeah there is a whole

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:06,100
bunch of solutions for that can I walk

00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:10,270
on millions of rows which is till now

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,280
like totally not possible so or you

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,140
could actually use like you know the

00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,360
very nice solution of splitting your

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:19,600
data into 10 Excel files and then trying

00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,880
to do a big data like mapreduce and yes

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,550
band us again okay but I really need to

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,960
work with axel because like you need to

00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,320
have axial otherwise you won't be able

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:33,160
to survive in the jungle data so read

00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,170
docs of pandas you know all right what

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:37,900
was the result this is working progress

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,990
we are still struggling and fighting and

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:43,690
trying to enforce our way of thinking

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,839
the result is far from utopian and but i

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:48,910
think that lots of people actually learn

00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,290
something new lots of people started to

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:53,890
automate there were lots of people

00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:56,710
started to actually gain and do

00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:59,350
something in the free time this time

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:02,080
that we free up by just introducing the

00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:05,350
solutions and the main question was like

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:07,600
why did we do that so we have like very

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,360
huge open space and i'm actually sitting

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,190
down and observing people and we are

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,320
like making jokes like the tech team

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,290
we're quite happy guys and then I

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,390
observe in those analysts and the folder

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,180
that I showed you of this crazy Brazil

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:23,220
fun so basically this is kind of a faces

00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,889
that doing

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,449
the big data whatever and and you can

00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,759
clearly see that those people are not

00:13:27,449 --> 00:13:31,230
enjoying the day so we thought like we

00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,389
need to give them something that will

00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:35,160
enable them to express themselves some

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:37,560
expressiveness and the programming

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,600
language is up this is actually the

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,370
tools of the sort if I will give you any

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,410
kind of problem you will start to

00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,389
actually putting the keywords and the

00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,449
grammar of Python all together and give

00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,819
me the solution they are the slaves of

00:13:48,449 --> 00:13:55,230
the UI's which are actually just

00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:57,120
enslaving them and giving them know sort

00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,949
of expressiveness it's about actually

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,019
you know the scenarios the clickability

00:13:58,949 --> 00:14:03,209
scenarios that's what I actually

00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,029
achieving with the expressiveness comes

00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:08,519
creativity so I was thinking like I'm

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:10,290
I'm a software engineer know what kind

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,209
of application you need but if I will

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,730
give you the expressiveness and and free

00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:16,709
up some time of your so that you can

00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,540
actually use your creativity with those

00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:20,160
new tools you will come up with really

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,689
awesome applications because you you

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:24,029
know what you need you know adjuster II

00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:25,860
and of course at the end of the day the

00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,509
most important is freedom so I think

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,160
that those people's the ones that

00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:31,639
actually leverage this knowledge started

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,920
to be much much more productive and

00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:36,209
hopefully happier so let's welcome

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,029
Fabrizio that will actually take you

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,649
through the biggest challenge ever taken

00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,199
in the in the UK which is actually

00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:45,559
training non-programmers to program in

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,559
python

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:09,100
so hello everyone so basically when we

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,460
submitted the the abstract we were asked

00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,040
to to have a separate section about the

00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:17,830
educational aspect of this journey that

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:24,520
we had so these are my slides about it

00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:29,380
you can find them here it's a it's open

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:32,890
in public and a little bit about me it's

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,900
a little bit so don't have much time so

00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,360
why this part of the presentation the

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,810
short answer is that we asked us and the

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,330
short answer is we hope it's interesting

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:46,480
basically some people teach Python some

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,730
people train other people in Python some

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,880
people have colleagues that they go how

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:54,310
do you do this how do you do that and so

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,650
I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about a set of

00:15:54,310 --> 00:16:00,040
guidelines that that hopefully will

00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:03,310
inspire you in your in your in your work

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:06,190
whatever you do what we are going to

00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:09,340
talk about what the training should do

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:12,520
what the trainer should do and basically

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,590
about my experience in in Manila I've

00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,080
been in Manila two weeks in March to

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:20,110
train 20 people it was a very nice

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:25,950
experience I asked to have four groups

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:28,930
of five people each part as much

00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,520
differentiated as possible because I

00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,980
didn't want to have like one group of

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,710
super smart people and one group of less

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,880
smart people I want them I wanted them

00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:42,220
to be able to help each other and so

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,790
wait wait wait these are the guys these

00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:47,900
are my my Manila my money like guys and

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:51,260
amazing people

00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:54,830
so what a train is should do is two

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:56,660
things listen with the capital L which

00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,660
means you have a trainer at your

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,690
disposal so squeezing as much as you can

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:06,290
if you are ever going to take training

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,060
in anything get everything you can get

00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,500
the knowledge the experience what they

00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:14,089
think why they think the way they think

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:16,460
how do they get the solution to the

00:17:14,089 --> 00:17:19,520
problems get try to get everything from

00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:23,200
them use that opportunity and work hard

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,170
of course what the trainer should do I

00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:30,080
think it should achieve excellent in the

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:32,570
following first of all smile and be

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,360
patient because if you if you don't do

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,070
that you will put a wall between

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,880
yourself and the people you're trying to

00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:43,760
to teach something to and they won't be

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,640
open anymore and you need them to be

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,250
open if you want anything to pass to

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,790
pass that to them never take anything

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,820
for granted so you can go and teach

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,290
non-programmers and start yet so we're

00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,670
going to write a function and then a

00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,020
method and then we're going to use the

00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,320
class and then we're going to iterate

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:04,790
over this stuff and they go like what

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,190
because they absolutely have no idea

00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,260
what the function is what a method is so

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,170
you have to give them the concept the

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,900
lingo all the words that we as coders

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:17,150
use every day and we were not maybe even

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:20,090
aware that this is a special language

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,860
that that we know and we use what they

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,170
don't know and they don't use so the

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,270
ideas why do we need to do what we need

00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:29,270
to do and the reasons the reasons behind

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,850
behind all the techniques that we use

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:36,020
like code reuse for example why why is

00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:38,000
important use the GPS technique this is

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,980
this is something that I always say so

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,400
you're trying to bring someone from

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:46,070
point A to point B through a bunch of of

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:50,330
rods and at some point you can see by

00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:52,490
their faces that you lost them because

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:55,100
there's some concept that they are

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:58,190
missing so they can't go from here to

00:18:55,100 --> 00:19:00,410
here in this case it's it's you you have

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,950
to find another way to

00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:06,680
explain to them so ask what is not clear

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:10,070
choose different words provide other

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:11,840
examples do not repeat the same stuff in

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:16,100
the same way because they are not going

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,340
to go through that through that road set

00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:22,190
some goals they should be reachable

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,660
start gently so they do not scare off at

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,330
the beginning and then gradually

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,000
increase difficulty and skip the boring

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,250
treatment stuff is possible so they

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,010
don't start wandering off cell phones

00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:36,020
and stuff and deliver outstanding

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,440
quality material you have to put your

00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,650
best effort into it when you prepare the

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,450
materials for the first reason you have

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:47,510
to enjoy it as well needs to be a

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:49,510
pleasant experience for you as well give

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:52,280
them only what what they need to know

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,130
because we're all pressed in time

00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:57,560
especially for me it was the London

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,390
people Manila people they're very open

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,030
the very hardworking people London

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:04,220
people are a bit more difficult because

00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:06,740
they have at least in our company they

00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,910
have a lot of things to do and so if

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,850
they get the feeling that you are

00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:13,190
telling them something they don't need

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:15,110
they get they get I'm not saying upset

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:17,000
but just we don't we don't need this we

00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,040
don't have time for this or just give me

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,110
what I need so just give them what they

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:26,570
need foco focus on the needs which means

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:28,700
if at some point you get you get to you

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,030
get to a point where you have to explain

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,450
something again do that instead of

00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:37,670
trying to stick to your original to your

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,030
original plan and refer to the real

00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:43,220
world something easy to relate to so

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,410
this is this is just one example when I

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:48,350
when always explaining how to handle

00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:51,230
files it's it's all very new you can't

00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:54,260
just go and say yes you have a handler

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,030
to a file a pointer here and there you

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,980
have to open it to something with the

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:00,230
file and close it they won't remember it

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:02,210
so if you give them the example and you

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,090
say like a file is like a fridge they

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:06,860
all know how to use a fridge so you open

00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:08,900
the fridge you put something in and you

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,790
close the fridge and they already know

00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,220
how to handle a file because they have

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,600
the association with something

00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,630
been using since they were little kids

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:21,190
this is very important because they will

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:24,039
not forget that and adapt so that speed

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,620
difficulty and so have extra materials

00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:29,230
ready if you have a group of people that

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,900
are actually fast and know what you can

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:35,220
cut if you have a group of people that

00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:37,809
are less fast and entertain them

00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,520
communicate your passion make them laugh

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,650
and have a good time don't be too strict

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,320
if they make a mistake use them those

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,900
mistakes and to explain things again

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,850
instead of saying all you made a mistake

00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,220
and the next one is only for the brave

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:54,580
so if you have to take a slight with you

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:58,330
home today just take this one flash your

00:21:54,580 --> 00:22:00,730
ego down the toilet this is because

00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:03,100
you're doing it for them not for you and

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:07,000
if you do it for them it's just gonna

00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:10,570
get so much better the tools that I used

00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,830
and when window and then a bash shell

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,870
ipython console in notebook libraries

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:19,150
pandas numpy and and the analytical

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:22,900
interface that we that we brought my

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:24,940
paint with the cheap wacom tablet that

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,890
is this is really really useful because

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,900
if I have to explain what the function

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:30,909
is I just go crazy to someone who is not

00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,919
the coder but if you can draw a box with

00:22:30,909 --> 00:22:35,260
with an arrow that goes in with an arrow

00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:37,270
that goes out and you sit about you know

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,460
a bunch of lines of code that takes some

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:43,690
input and produce an output they all go

00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:48,130
out ok and Skype or Google Hangouts when

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:50,980
you have to to to go remote and this is

00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:53,110
an overview of what is it possible to

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,320
deliver in about 12 hours so we had an

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:58,809
introduction section session for Python

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,900
ipython sessions three data oriented

00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:04,720
session and one QA session at the end so

00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:08,020
the introduction session is giving them

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,640
all the points all the concepts so they

00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,130
have to they have to understand at least

00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,840
high level what's looping branching and

00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:16,900
so on and so forth and it's really

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,360
important because it provides content

00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:22,120
context so they don't get lost when you

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,230
when you then start to explain this

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,179
stuff debate the basics of of Python so

00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:29,490
Kadri using functions to looping and

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,919
wrenching handling files byte on data

00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:35,580
structures the main data structure and

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:39,270
the main building functions extra

00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:41,250
materials that I delivered so advanced

00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:43,320
stuff with dictionaries function

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,630
arguments list comprehension slicing and

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:50,130
the broader introduction to built-ins

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:52,230
and the data oriented sections basically

00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,000
when you work with data you have to do

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,160
three things you fetch data you work

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,110
with with it you clean it in you mangle

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,370
it and then you provide some sort of

00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:03,570
output that can be text statistics or

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,500
you know those pretty graphs that

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:09,600
everybody likes and you have to use of

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,490
course Jason because stuff that comes we

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,220
work we work with Twitter and Facebook

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,049
so we've got a lot of Jason to to work

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,510
with and rake some regular expressions

00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:20,070
some string manipulation and of course

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:23,549
the lovely datetime objects especially

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:27,059
with time zones they are nice so that's

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:29,549
it I hope this was a interesting for you

00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:31,740
you feel free to contact us and before

00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:34,260
before we close an operation I have a

00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:37,260
question I have a favor to ask to all of

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:40,169
you there's a lady that I love to beat

00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,179
and she's coming out of surgery in this

00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:44,370
very moment so if we if we could have a

00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:48,559
round of applause to wish her good luck

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,559
I would really appreciate that

00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,580
we have a few a few minutes for for

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:12,560
questions now please remember to use the

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:14,540
microphones thanks for the talk so we

00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,910
have a similar problem in my current

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,080
company but what would they ask for us

00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:23,330
normally I'd just queries basically just

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,880
how many of these this month how many of

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,670
that so maybe for us it would be even

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,880
simpler we could just somehow make it

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:33,500
simple to make queries you have any

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,420
suggestions how we can do that in a way

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,790
that they don't allow are not allowed to

00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:41,930
make some crazy queries that kill the

00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:43,640
database or deleted all the records yes

00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,620
this is exactly what we've done with

00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,600
with the d3 analytical interface

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,990
basically we provide an interface to

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,080
them and this this interface limits

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:57,560
their what they can do with the database

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:01,610
basically shifts the database and it has

00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:04,490
two two basic advantages they can query

00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:08,420
the data regardless of where the data

00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:10,070
store or how the data is stored and and

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,780
we don't have the problem of someone

00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:14,870
saying oh you know what I deleted

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:17,120
everything so because because they can't

00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,840
there's no delete everything through

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,840
that interface

00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:34,240
um how do you catch up with the

00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:38,220
questions which comes afterwards after

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,620
you leave Manila for example oh yeah

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:44,139
basically I didn't after I left from

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,210
Manila some people we're still asking

00:26:44,139 --> 00:26:49,210
how do you do this how do you do that

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:52,659
and of course I always make time if my

00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:55,539
boss is happy I I do a remote session if

00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:58,200
for any reason I'm very pressed I do a

00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:00,549
bit of overtime maybe an hour or so and

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,779
because I'm always happy to do this i

00:27:00,549 --> 00:27:07,419
really really love teaching python or

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:09,879
whatever so it's always a pleasure to

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:12,730
help someone especially when when they

00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:16,240
are eager to learn I just can't say no

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:17,559
so so yeah and there is also one more

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,419
thing because please remember that as

00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:23,259
soon as you introduce notebooks this is

00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:25,360
the communication actually an item that

00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:27,039
is used so whenever there is a bar got a

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,830
problem that you share notebook with you

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,539
it's not high level email sent to you

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,759
like hey by the way this is the problem

00:27:31,539 --> 00:27:35,980
they just give you in notebook you just

00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,710
run it and say alright this is a bug and

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:41,379
it's very simple to actually you know II

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:43,360
that's why we said that that Python

00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:44,950
would be used as a foreign language for

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,019
us even though we are offering as using

00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:49,840
English English is not enough to

00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:56,950
actually discuss their problems we need

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:59,169
to go into more formal one hi thanks of

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:00,879
all first of all thanks for the talk you

00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:04,320
nearly answered my question could you

00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:07,090
have done it without ipython notebooks I

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,620
think that we actually were at there and

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:10,450
you know it was a perfect time to

00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,399
introduce kind of solution because I

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,850
think that it would introduce them like

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,740
a console base you know solution which

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,019
was like the bare-bones fight on with

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,570
even without ipython you know like it's

00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:24,669
showing giving all the nice colors in

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,309
the console we will never actually be

00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:29,590
able to introduce or dolphin push this

00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:31,809
idea and a third i bite or notebook

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,330
gives this enough you I that you need

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:35,740
you can plot things there and this is

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:37,509
mainly what they do they want to get

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,159
data they want to actually perform some

00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,710
stuff on the data the other thing was

00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:44,090
that they almost

00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,470
on the laptops and I think is that the

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:48,990
amount of data that are dealing with are

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,120
just too big for Dale up to handle so

00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,830
what we did we just bought this super

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,659
powerful server and just hosted the

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,679
notebooks there so since they are

00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,750
working in different time zones

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,480
basically they could have like thirty

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,029
two gigabytes of RAM of 40 or 64

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,020
gigabytes of RAM just like that and just

00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:06,360
perform and since there were not you

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,890
know building the graphical

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,630
representation of the excel file they

00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,850
could actually help handle even more and

00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:15,179
more data with that and then at the end

00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:16,500
it was synced with their laptops so so

00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:19,679
when they were done they could actually

00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,750
just save their results and even carry

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:28,140
on on their laptops with much smaller

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:30,390
already cleaned up data or plots you

00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,940
said that you were using Ubuntu for the

00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,830
trainings what did you do afterwards if

00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,690
some people were using Windows or some

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:39,419
other operating systems is that that you

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,250
have a server with notebooks so do all

00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:43,710
the people use just that server or do

00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:45,960
they have local environment so they were

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:48,029
using their own computers with windows

00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:52,470
unfortunately but everybody uses windows

00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:56,010
and the place where we host this

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,919
technology is isn't on debian right so

00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:01,380
the notebooks are on debian and i use

00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:04,020
you going to so if you want to be a

00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,480
trainer we're going to gives you all the

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:10,049
tools that you need you can do anything

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,620
you want and the beauty of the ipython

00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:15,929
notebook technology is that it's not

00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:17,490
really important what kind of system

00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:20,010
you're using because basically you do

00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,740
everything in the browser so as long as

00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:27,149
you have firefox or chrome and you don't

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:31,559
use a the other one can't even pronounce

00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:33,960
it so yeah if you if you are on on

00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:36,419
windows door there is a small problem

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,850
when uploading stuff with chrome so if

00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:42,659
that happens don't go crazy the bargain

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:44,370
just use firefox and it will work yes

00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,230
but how do you deal with people that

00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:48,210
like want to install packages on their

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,520
laptops or something like that like

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,460
especially if you do data analysis numpy

00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,429
NT stuff can get kind of hard and

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,990
explaining them

00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:59,320
like my kitchen managers and everything

00:30:55,990 --> 00:31:01,299
could be hard so do they just not do

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,409
that and use the server or do they

00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:06,249
actually want to use Python locally oh

00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:07,840
basically they didn't have to do

00:31:06,249 --> 00:31:10,029
anything on their on their laptops

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,820
everything was provided on on the server

00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:15,399
side so where we host the notebooks we

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,159
have installed all the libraries so the

00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:21,190
three analytical interface my side by my

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,320
clock lib pandas everything they need is

00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:25,480
there installed for ready to use so they

00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:27,580
just open the notebooks we have an

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,340
authentication system for for each

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:32,529
analyst and they go in and they do from

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,340
blah import blah and and it just works

00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:40,179
for them so they have a slow slow window

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,889
box or super nice ubuntu machine that

00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:45,129
doesn't really matter because the heavy

00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:49,720
lifting is all done by us in the server

00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:55,629
that match was talking about before are

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:57,580
there any more questions so i understand

00:31:55,629 --> 00:31:59,919
that the data analysts are quite happy

00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:02,110
you were also talking about the human

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,220
resources people and the accounting

00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:13,749
department which have quite different

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:16,869
needs like payroll which was it handled

00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:19,509
also did you so if you think about it

00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:22,690
like 11 project that james developed for

00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:25,240
an finance team was basically you know

00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:26,950
they had this super annoying thing that

00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,600
they were doing manually which was just

00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,220
combining excel files that were

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,139
delivered by the sales guide and

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,690
basically they had to build some repos

00:32:32,139 --> 00:32:35,950
on top of that so sounds trivial but for

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:38,950
them is just the money will work there

00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:42,369
is no other alternative it's just wasted

00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:44,559
in wasted time during that during during

00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:47,470
which that person will go irritate it

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,659
and then just one of us in this case

00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:52,659
James just provided solution for them so

00:32:49,659 --> 00:32:54,850
basically we gave them the tools to talk

00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:56,350
of the data to actually get the data but

00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:57,639
at the same time we're listening for

00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,590
some new stuff that we can actually

00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:01,570
deliver on top of that so we were just

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,149
basically delivering them like one

00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:05,559
magical black box you know a function

00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:07,210
that they could actually call like a

00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:09,490
create report and of

00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:12,070
under the hood lots of stuff was were

00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:14,679
happening but but since we were free up

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,880
from delivering Qi because nobody

00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:18,370
require that anymore we could actually

00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,039
just focus on on the business value on

00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:28,659
the business and algorithm that was

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:34,659
actually delivering the solution please

00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:37,419
please use the microphones the use of X

00:33:34,659 --> 00:33:40,870
or several such programs decrease after

00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:43,120
your training so so basically it didn't

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:44,770
decrease because then the thing is that

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:47,370
they were not able in some cases to use

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,980
it at all like you know just imagine and

00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,779
they had this very nice and adjustment

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,450
mechanism so they were opening an excel

00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:57,549
file and if the person was smoking did

00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,590
that person knew that it means around 30

00:33:57,549 --> 00:34:02,230
minutes open that file so that was a

00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,720
break time basically so they just

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:06,669
stopped opening those so maybe less

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,040
breaks maybe that's bad actually and I

00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:11,290
know but in Manila actually change

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:13,300
things changed a bit they're starting to

00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,580
use ipython they didn't reduce the

00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,530
ipython notebook thing step by step in

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,899
the process so that we're doing a bit

00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:21,849
and then switch into Excel and do the

00:34:19,899 --> 00:34:24,149
rest and then another bit and then

00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:26,710
switching to excel until it was all I

00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:28,510
think the most important is that even if

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,310
you train them even if you show them all

00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,770
the solutions you still need to wait for

00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:34,179
this discovery moment when they actually

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,889
send you this email like wow they

00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,899
actually realize that this is powerful

00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,820
stuff no there will i think all right

00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:41,710
some keywords something is flying around

00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,909
but then they actually automated a

00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:44,530
pipeline you know and they actually

00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:46,540
realize that i can do something creative

00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,220
and actually contribute to something

00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:53,560
interesting rather than you know just

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:57,300
just clicking through day life ok thank

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,300
you very much ma che and Fabrizio

00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,280
