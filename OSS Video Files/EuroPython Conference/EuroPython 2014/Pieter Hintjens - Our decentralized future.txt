Description: 
	Pieter Hintjens - Our decentralized future
[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

Pieter will talk about the urgent push towards a decentralized future.  As founder of the ZeroMQ community, he will explain the vision, design and reality of distributed software systems. He’ll explain his view on the community itself, also a highly decentralized “Living System”, as Hintjens calls it. Finally he’ll talk about edgenet, a model for a decentralized Internet.

so good morning it's me again I'm

00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,210
to have to introduce Peter Hinton's yes

00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,710
Ben

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:29,540
is a long-term community activist and on

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,050
many fronts he fought against software

00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,360
patents he did like on an organization

00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:39,290
level and apparently as you know it also

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,570
succeeded and he is also the main one of

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,330
the main guys behind 0 and Q both

00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,980
developing wise and designing wise he

00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:50,199
has written books called chyme

00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:52,940
empire he probably likes to show it and

00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,930
he's also thinking about apart from

00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:59,360
developing like system

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,850
questions about and philosophical

00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:05,089
questions about systems how to organize

00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,430
them also on the society level but also

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,380
on the technical level and consulting

00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:12,890
companies on disability systems and so

00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:16,940
on and what we're doing here is that

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,520
peter is going to give some give some

00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,010
input and this is going to be a bit of a

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,430
different format than the keynotes we

00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:28,910
saw in the last days in that you are

00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:32,180
invited very soon to walk up to the

00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,550
microphones and to enter a discussion so

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,470
peter has of course a lot of prepared

00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:39,970
thoughts but he's very happy to actually

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:43,520
enter some kind of more interactive

00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:46,820
discussion and please if you when we do

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,040
that and try to restrain yourself to

00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,630
something like 30 seconds think of it

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,900
like a tweet or something like this

00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,070
maybe also a 60 seconds sometimes you

00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:58,460
want to present something more but

00:01:55,070 --> 00:02:01,490
please don't go over that and Peter is

00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:04,370
going to repeat what he understood from

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,560
you then and otherwise I think we're

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:11,120
going to have an interesting discussion

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,160
and so I give the word to Peter thank

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:19,030
you however thank you very much

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:22,780
you're a Python you guys are awesome so

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,610
I'm the 0 mq guy as they call me we it's

00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,680
a tough community I founded it but they

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,830
you know I made a bad patch and I got

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,600
this the other day so you know it's off

00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,860
actually this came from a couple of Ruby

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,600
guys who were know I came to Europe

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:40,300
Python it's a funny community the Syrian

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,170
community I've done many community

00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:45,550
projects many and it's the first one

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,860
large community project where there's no

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:49,270
fighting and no arguing and people will

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,890
argue with me a little bit but in zero

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,480
and pew community if you look at the

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,130
mailing list you won't find flame wars

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,270
you won't find people with any kind of

00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:01,300
emotional anxiety or this is basically

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:04,000
very pragmatic straightforward walking

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,680
through what happens and this is this is

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,200
very unusual in a in a large project 0

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,570
mq is actually a project of projects I

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,430
looked at the github organization

00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:20,500
they're about 675 projects that use 0 mq

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,310
no title somewhere in github is about I

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,190
think 15 year organizers

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:30,370
it's about half a million lines of code

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,290
with about 400 contributors ok it's been

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,490
about seven years building this up I'll

00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,130
give you these figures just to tell you

00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:37,750
how big it is and how active it is my

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,790
one of my projects is a seed binding

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,690
that has another ten languages on top

00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,270
that use it and wrap it and links d-q

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,530
ooc o camel CL - of course - ruby

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:51,040
bindings on top they can never agree

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:53,020
those guys and the Python binding on top

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,150
of that and the Cora serum cue library

00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,790
is about 33,000 lines of code so it's

00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,790
about 15 17 percent of the whole project

00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,060
and this is a big project is successful

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:09,070
and yet we don't really argue or fight

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,950
also we don't do design we don't do

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,720
meetings we don't do IRC meetings we

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,550
barely have meetups anymore I used to

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,890
organize these meetups you know like two

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,480
three weekends where we discuss what

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:22,240
come in the next version we stopped

00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:26,700
doing all of that now and then we have

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,700
you know we have beer that's about it

00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,740
we don't do meeting tonight see we don't

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,570
do wish lists we don't have roadmaps

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,150
there's barely anyone in charge even I

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,590
mean I'm I'm kind of in charge but I'm

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,090
mostly busy looking after my kids the

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:46,750
back there my three kids I brought them

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:48,250
with me to come and see Berlin and

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,350
you've been being very good with them I

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,400
was I was kind of a bit afraid what

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,980
would happen but they've been they've

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,900
been good thanks for that so this this

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:02,560
is a very strange community unusual in

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,930
many ways and it's not accidental now

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,030
this has happened over time we've

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,940
developed over time a process in a way

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,730
of working very deliberately to get away

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,200
from certain problems now what we do is

00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,390
we solve problems and all of our

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:19,210
problems somehow came from

00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,310
centralization and so the theme of this

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,860
talk today is about this kind of

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:24,910
conflict and fight between

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,590
centralization which we as engineers we

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:29,530
love you know we love the feeling of

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,570
being God and creating with our brain

00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,910
something miraculous in you and that

00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:37,210
requires coercion that requires power

00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:41,050
requires control and yet the natural

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,140
world our economies are everything we

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,720
live in is about decentralization giving

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,580
up control if you look at a city like

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,370
Berlin or London or New York or Brussels

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:54,730
or any village even who runs the food

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:56,440
the food supply system well nobody it's

00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,830
a completely decentralized system I

00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,290
think Berlin has maybe two days worth of

00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:04,030
food in the pipeline and yet we all eat

00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,400
every day we have lovely ice cream and

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,280
drinks and it's all magically working

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,350
and no one is in charge and so our most

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,490
essential systems are decentralized with

00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:16,980
nobody in charge and we know from the

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,090
history of Europe that when someone

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:23,080
organizes a central planning committee

00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:24,220
the results are disastrous right so why

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,150
do we accept that in our software

00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,150
engineering projects

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:36,860
okay if you look at the zero MQ

00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:39,940
community as a kind of a worked example

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:44,440
of this what you will see is a

00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:50,990
decentralized asynchronous concurrent

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:53,140
message driven lock-free process with

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,670
with no one really in charge of it

00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,790
we came from before was a very

00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:02,570
conventional single-threaded highly

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:04,690
locked shared state very serial not very

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:08,180
much concurrently concurrently going on

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:11,210
with no message passing process run by a

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,470
few guys and that's the process that you

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,690
will know from most of your work and

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,990
most of your projects a very planned

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:20,800
system possibly a hierarchy with a very

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:24,350
clear flow of power from top to bottom

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,580
flow over orders and executions most of

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,110
you in companies you work in will

00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,110
recognize this is your daily environment

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:31,400
right how many people work in companies

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,490
and our employees and don't have this

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,710
model well I see very few hands a few

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,540
very few and probably you're running

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,570
your own companies at that point or in

00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,490
charge in some way and when you scale to

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:47,110
more than a few friends you'll find that

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,110
you somehow need this level of coercion

00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:56,120
so stepping back from controlling what

00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,360
we make allowing people to compete and

00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,500
make freely not deciding what the future

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,660
will bring but allowing future to

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,270
develop naturally and organically out of

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,210
problems it's kind of difficult and yet

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,010
if you can't do that you know where's

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:13,790
the future now let's look at the future

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:15,830
of computing specifically we come from a

00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,480
past where computers are very very

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,250
expensive

00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,080
we all remember IBM's famous market

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,830
study of 50 mainframes as a global

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,140
market we go to a future where computers

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,630
are dirt cheap they literally cost less

00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,120
than dirt and there's trillions of them

00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,560
and every year the fall you know the

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,280
price falls and a number of computers

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,180
Rises and so the future of computing is

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:42,350
distributed whether you like it or not

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:45,470
and if as engineers we can't build

00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:47,570
scalable distributed software we don't

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,760
have a job in five or ten or twenty

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:56,390
years time it's simply a matter of time

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,890
not of if but of when so as software

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,320
engineers which be asking the questions

00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:02,840
how do we build how do we build

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,620
successful distributed systems that's

00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:08,840
the future of our of our industry the

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,530
answer apparently and this is my best

00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:16,850
experience is it's kind of weird the

00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,850
answer is we can't actually build

00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,740
successful systems we can only grow them

00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,740
if you look at the examples that we have

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,090
of massively successful decentralized

00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,270
systems they've all been grown

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:32,030
organically apparently without planning

00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:35,600
the internet is the best example who

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:37,670
built the internet nobody built it what

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,170
is the internet we don't even know where

00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,490
is the internet it's in a box on my

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:44,330
table don't break it

00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:47,060
alright and this mysterious thing it

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:52,730
defines our lives and is built by nobody

00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:53,630
or everybody has grown over time can

00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,940
anyone tell me what the Internet

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,890
actually is someone give me a one-line

00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,720
or tweet for the Internet let's have our

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,850
first volunteer the first person to give

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,970
this a decent answer wins this book

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,240
right now okay and this book is worth it

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,680
the microphone is there sir you have to

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,950
move the microphone someone what is the

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,860
Internet a network of autonomous

00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,600
networks now I like it but it's not good

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:19,399
enough someone else

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,870
sorry I have the microphone on either

00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:26,120
side it's just the communication channel

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,709
nah not good enough sorry it's it's

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,139
brave to stand up but still somebody

00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:34,790
else the internet the Internet you know

00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,899
the answer when I say to you be like oh

00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:40,250
yes of course come on everything that's

00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:43,910
between computers

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:45,680
it's the sorry everything that's between

00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:48,949
computers everything between computers

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,019
no we're not yet satisfied are we it's a

00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:55,480
living being it's a living being we're

00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,480
getting very meta here no come on let's

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:04,459
whoops substrate to the human race okay

00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,630
a substrate I will make it easy I'll

00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:08,959
just give you the answer and keep the

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:12,579
poop for myself I like my own books the

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,440
Internet is a stack of protocols okay

00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:17,540
it's very dry and academic and legal

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,269
issue whatever RFC's are the internet

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,949
the internet are is a stack of RFC's we

00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:24,050
have now thousands of RFC's it used to

00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:30,470
be only a handful of you doesn't the

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:33,450
very first RFC RFC 0:01 I believe is an

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,940
RFC for writing RFC's

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,110
or got very close maybe number two that

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:48,870
is the internet it's a bunch of

00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:53,970
contracts what do we think does he get

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:56,750
the book okay let's give the gentleman

00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:59,750
the book or you can come and get it here

00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,750
okay

00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:08,100
now the fun thing to note about the

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,170
Internet is that when it was invented

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,030
which it wasn't when it was born which

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,230
is more accurate there were very many

00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:20,650
companies very many large companies with

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:22,420
existing similar systems it wasn't like

00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:23,680
there was nothing and then some guys in

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:26,410
the garage said whoo let's make some

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,810
networking come on the biggest companies

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,650
in the world had spent billions in

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:35,470
making networks and this went on as long

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,450
as who was still you guys are all very

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:42,250
young ladies and gentlemen but I

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:44,470
remember 1995 and I remember windows 95

00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:45,910
which came out without networking and

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,880
then they brought networking and they

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:50,040
called it MSN 1.0 and that was

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,710
Microsoft's

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,240
network and it didn't even talk to the

00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:59,020
internet which they regard as a second

00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,990
class thing kind of a gypsy nerd rubbish

00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:04,240
and MSN one did not talk the Internet

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,050
and we had a o L we had IBM with their

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,810
Lu 6.2 and all this rubbish it wasn't

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:13,690
that the internet came in it in a void

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,190
it was competing against the largest

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,290
companies in the world with the biggest

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,190
budget sin the most brilliant engineers

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,950
and the most power right and it

00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,940
destroyed them without even blinking it

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:30,310
asteroid time without even thinking

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:32,200
about it twice so we're talking here

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:34,960
about very significant competitive

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:39,400
advantage and everybody whose job it was

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,720
to build lu 6.2 bridges had to either

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,330
learn something else or go on a

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,850
retirement all right there was no future

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,280
in IBM networking or even in Novell

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:51,070
networking in the end and certainly not

00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:53,320
in MSN and lol only because they gave

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:58,360
away lots of free CDs and spammed us all

00:13:53,320 --> 00:14:01,330
four years and the internet the stupid

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,170
little RFC's became world power they

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:06,820
became a superpower and yet nobody

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,140
nobody really invested in that huge

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,660
amount of money there was no one backing

00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,940
it there was no you know Steve Jobs or

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,080
Bill Gates behind that that should

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,279
demonstrate you the power of the market

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,940
when it's enabled by accurate contracts

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,430
which is what RFC's are okay and so

00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:29,240
we've all lived through this growth of

00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:31,640
this superpower technology grown by

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,230
competition and collaboration with

00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,360
actually very few fights and arguments

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,310
most of the fights and arguments were

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,290
from the losers when they discovered

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,660
they couldn't hijack the process oh you

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:44,300
can't use our patented email oh damn oh

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,190
we can't capture this in this most of

00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,200
the actual honest work was done any

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,730
fighting argument at all and so we all

00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,890
know this but we kind of ignore it and

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:57,170
we come back to the old model of trying

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:58,579
to make stuff by power right it's very

00:14:57,170 --> 00:15:00,380
ironic how we can in our minds have

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:02,930
these two completely in a contradictory

00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:09,920
models operation we all depend on the

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:12,200
one yet we all make the other and so let

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,089
me throw you one of these a little bit

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,300
argumentative controversial statements

00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:21,529
I'd like to make about the nature of

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:23,240
good software now all those IBM

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,800
engineers and even most the Microsoft

00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,230
engineers in the certain novel engineers

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,630
all made good software there were all

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,450
very good programmers they were all you

00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,070
know highly selected good degrees in

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,310
computer science they whole made

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,959
fantastic you know scalable algorithms

00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,660
and everything else perfect all their

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,649
stuff was thrown out right as it's most

00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:48,320
software so what defines good software

00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:50,120
and I'll argue that most of us in our

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,740
industry have a completely wrong

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,390
understanding of that it's one of our

00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,040
biggest weaknesses that we do not

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,610
understand what quality is in software

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,140
we fundamentally got it wrong and that

00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,940
wrong assumption drives us to

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:06,350
extraordinary mistakes a lot of what we

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,410
did in the 0m community was to correct

00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,370
that big misunderstanding what I

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,060
consider to be a big misunderstanding

00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:17,149
about software quality and so the old

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,740
model of collaboration and 0 mq

00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:21,649
community was I will explain how it

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,140
worked there was a guy who's who was the

00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:26,089
the main author he was the main draw

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,339
author he would write code be very

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:29,040
clever a genius man there was a friend

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:30,810
of his who was a

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,029
maintainer and he could understand

00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,740
getting branches and merges and packages

00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:36,360
and make files an auto confidant is very

00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,160
complex stuff and he could talk to this

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,600
man here they would the brains would

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,060
synchronize with his amazing shared

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,910
state which involved lots of beer and

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:47,610
meetings in strange locations and these

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,259
two were a very good team made amazingly

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,250
good software which was very fast and

00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,899
didn't crash and was good it was amazing

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,690
and then there's all these other guys

00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,130
here who were like using it and

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,040
contributing it but the contributions

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,959
had to go by a mailing list to one of

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,880
these two guys here who would then look

00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:08,669
at the meaningless patches and say we

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,299
don't like your patch we don't agree

00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:15,540
with your patch we think your patch is

00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:16,949
mm we don't like it and you know it's

00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,360
basically it's our baby so you know we

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:22,919
don't like it oh well think about it

00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:24,089
your codes badly indented mmm and so

00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:26,839
there was this very strange

00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:28,890
communication process based on pure

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,280
monopoly of power it was a purely

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:35,100
classic very serial single threaded

00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,590
highly blocking synchronous process

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,870
based on this fuzzy communication nobody

00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,059
could ever track no one ever knew what

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:45,360
the basis was for a decision the users

00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:48,210
had no idea and I think after I had like

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,559
my fourth or fifth patch rejected and

00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:51,900
I'm like why is my stuff being rejected

00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:55,020
I'm gonna contribute here I mean of

00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,790
course I felt very hurt so I cuddled my

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,260
babies and said this is terrible but

00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:00,150
what I really felt was like if I'm

00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:02,940
getting my stuff rejected what about

00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,580
other people this sucks

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,990
and this was my money in the table so I

00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:11,669
was kind of annoyed as well as a

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:13,440
businessman and that wasn't the worst

00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:15,679
part the worst part was that what came

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,600
out of this process was really rubbish

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,669
and it was really bad it was it was

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,500
actually it was actually sad we took us

00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:25,169
like six months to make a stable release

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,290
we would spend six months just removing

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:31,020
bugs from raw code and we would throw

00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,549
the stuff at users who would say oh it's

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,070
better than being stabbed in the eye

00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:38,700
with a fork but it's really it's really

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:41,429
why is this stuff so so raw why is it so

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,840
immature why is it so you know so much

00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,620
untested code in this

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,670
god base because this guy wrote code he

00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:52,890
was a very good engineer he liked to

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:54,540
write code engineers write code and as

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,340
we went through this kind of process of

00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,690
maturing the codebase we discovered that

00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,570
a lot of the code that was in there was

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,860
never actually used it was written for

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,050
no reason except with the person who

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,930
wrote it thought in his opinion that

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:10,380
people might need it one day or it was

00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:11,580
fun to write it or he absolutely had to

00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,510
make he was convinced that he had to

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,260
make it but he was wrong

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,030
we often wrong as humans and so what

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:20,790
came again the pipeline and if look at

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,530
the first versions of 0 mq they're the

00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,240
kind of embarrassing I mean they're very

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:26,730
good in certain ways but they're

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,670
obviously completely wrong

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,680
that's why nobody uses them today it's

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:35,340
kind of obvious

00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:38,370
and now over time we've gotten packages

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,530
and designs that have emerged which are

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:43,470
more and more and more accurate that's

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:44,850
why people are using them and the

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,650
current process is very strange

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:52,910
basically you you send a pull request to

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:55,410
master and I'll merge it and that's it

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:58,160
it's really that simple it's not quite

00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:01,560
that simple there's a little bit of

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,990
filtering of insanity but not much and

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,190
even insanity I tend to welcome and

00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,190
embrace it and say if you're really

00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,810
crazy enough to send me a compliment st.

00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:13,140
Paul requests I kind of like your your

00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:15,660
character come and join us you know it's

00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,970
always good to have diversity people who

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,240
agree with me aren't very useful to me

00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:23,160
in my projects people who argue with me

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,070
are always more valuable the law was

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,450
challenged my perspective and often

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:30,180
they'll be right and I'll be wrong in

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,650
fact and maybe they're patch isn't the

00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:35,190
right patch but their presence is the

00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:38,190
right presence and now you get to seeing

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:43,290
the software not as a quality in terms

00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:47,660
of how fast or how beautiful but in

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:49,309
terms of how accurate and how relevant

00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:52,549
which is a complete

00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:54,259
different thing right one person or a

00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:55,940
small team can write very high quality

00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,830
software in terms of its technical

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,259
characteristics but they are

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:04,220
uncompensated writing software that is

00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,899
relevant to a broad market and in fact

00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:11,899
only the market can write that software

00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:13,820
and so to make successful large systems

00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:16,730
you need to bring in successfully the

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,370
large market to make those systems ok

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:22,190
and so when you're building software

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:26,330
which has to be distributed which as I

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,950
explained the future does demand you

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:29,210
need to bring in communities that are

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,869
distributed otherwise you can't build

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:35,419
those systems no one's working with me

00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:36,950
here the microphones are there I should

00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:42,679
maybe give some diplomatic pauses and

00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:43,970
then people just stand up and okay any

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,850
time you like just raise your hands and

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,119
say Peter this stuff your thing is is is

00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,679
ludicrous you know you've heard of

00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,499
Conway's law Conway's law is coming

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,600
popular it says that as an organization

00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:58,460
we build systems that mirror our

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:01,909
communication patterns in the

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:06,740
organization if we are a top-down

00:22:01,909 --> 00:22:09,230
hierarchy with very coercive use of

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:10,850
power and a very one-way learning where

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,679
you learn at university you apply in

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:15,019
your job and that's it then the software

00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,779
we make will look like that it will be

00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:19,549
very big monolithic hierarchy with the

00:22:17,779 --> 00:22:23,149
flow of power from top to bottom and

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:24,200
basically very fragile over time as

00:22:23,149 --> 00:22:26,269
Microsoft Windows

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:30,519
we know how it how it works and how it

00:22:26,269 --> 00:22:32,419
dies if we are a decentralized

00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:34,429
organization with nobody really in

00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:37,369
charge with very strong contracts

00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:39,679
between different pieces between

00:22:37,369 --> 00:22:42,399
different layers with a very smooth

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,490
process for improving those contracts

00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:49,039
where the contracts let us compete very

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:52,429
honestly then what we build in the end

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,340
is a self software system based on

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,080
contracts with nobody really in charge

00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:59,809
with competition between pieces a very

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,550
different perspective gentleman Holger I

00:22:59,809 --> 00:23:04,730
believe because this is not about

00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:06,720
moderating I'm just having a question so

00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:08,990
what you're describing basically in the

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,790
process that you established with 0 mq

00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:15,390
sounds sorry if you repeat the question

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:19,730
what you described with the process with

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:23,210
0 mq that sounds like a coding wiki

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:27,270
right so basically people contribute

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:30,300
code and you look at it and if it

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:34,890
doesn't look like somewhat too crazy or

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:36,720
so you murdered so how how do you make

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,820
sure that if you release not make sure

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,830
right what is the experience then when

00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:43,410
you release something in terms of

00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,700
breakage how do you deal with tests and

00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,770
things like this like these are

00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:50,160
practical concerns ok so the question is

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:52,620
how do you come back to quality in a

00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,430
certain level what are what is your

00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,720
testable status for your deliverable

00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,100
I'll answer the question I will first

00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,270
I'll first make a comments about what

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,630
happened when we moved to word or

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:05,220
process it was about two years ago I

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:07,800
believe two and a half years ago and

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:10,590
actually my model when they explained to

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,090
people was Wikipedia I said I want to

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,830
get as close as I can to Wikipedia and

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:15,570
people said Peter you're insane and I'm

00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,210
like I might be insane but I know what

00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:20,820
I'm talking about with this here my goal

00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,290
is to bring in the most possible

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,890
contributors and give them the most

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,900
freedom to make good stuff and when

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,120
there are mistakes to detect them and

00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,780
fix them as fast as possible so low

00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,030
latency

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:35,420
I don't want six-month cycles I want

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:39,330
six-hour cycles or six-minute cycles and

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:41,550
making mistakes is fine it's one of

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:44,220
these fallacies of distributed computing

00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:45,990
is that the world is perfect but physics

00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,610
is not perfect there's always lag

00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:49,590
there's these vulnerabilities things

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:52,080
break things disappear people make

00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:53,610
mistakes people make big and small

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,370
mistakes and the trick is to let people

00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,680
make mistakes to learn from them not to

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:00,330
punish them and let them or others

00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,870
detect and fix those mistakes very

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:06,240
rapidly Wikipedia does this obviously

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:09,090
and it's been criticized for decades

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,620
well at least years as being full of

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,050
trolls and vandals but if you look at it

00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:15,180
what you see is the very successful

00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,960
accumulation of very accurate knowledge

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,310
over

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,030
time more and more and more and more

00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:24,810
unstoppably it's never had any real

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:27,660
crisis and that's because although you

00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:30,960
can vandalize any page you can also fix

00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:33,420
any vandalization very quickly and so

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:38,370
that was my kind of ideal model for the

00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:43,320
code base was where I could almost get

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:46,080
the master branches to be production

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,960
quality almost all the time and that's

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,880
what we got today and today most of my

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,340
work is always based off master on many

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,630
projects on a zero MP community we don't

00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,800
use the disable releases anymore we

00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:58,740
still make them for customers because

00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,320
customers like that but we get to the

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,630
point now where the master branch is

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,040
quality usable and how do we define

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,230
usability and I'm sorry for making you

00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:12,540
wait sir how do we define this stuff is

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:14,820
reliable trustable what we do is we let

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:18,420
the users of course contribute test

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,120
cases and the test cases are a contract

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,920
and when we build and we have Travis CI

00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,570
running on this all the time if you if

00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,160
you if you make a change that breaks the

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,470
test it shows right away in red there's

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,510
an error this stuff is broken that's not

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:32,310
a fatal mistake it's just a mistake

00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:35,390
somebody can fix it but it shows right

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:37,410
away so the thing about contracts

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:40,890
contracts by themselves aren't enough

00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:42,750
the contracts must be testable and the

00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,540
faster and the most awesome the more

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,340
automatic that can be tested the better

00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,870
this is why RFC's that our protocols can

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,030
be tested you if you have a web server

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,620
and you write it and it doesn't perform

00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,230
you can test that with web clients

00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:58,200
people do this all the time that's how

00:26:55,230 --> 00:27:00,900
you how you check it so every patch goes

00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,270
on master gets committed or merged tests

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,460
get run if it's broken master we know

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:07,710
about it and the test cases have grown

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,750
and grown and grown and grown as as they

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,050
were applied systematically as a quality

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,120
measure

00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,430
they simply grew to cover everything and

00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,790
now they cover the whole API and and

00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:21,540
that seems to work very well I think

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,880
your first offer technically I would

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,790
agree to almost everything you said but

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,440
somehow I thought I are you doing a

00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,629
parody so because we are

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,090
here on open source conference where we

00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:37,840
have a dictator for life chef lifetime

00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:40,600
and the same with Linux or Linux it's

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,289
the first mr. tobert was very dominant

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:47,409
in the first phase so maybe this

00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:50,500
dominance with Linux or even now with

00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:53,440
spice and is somehow not the best I told

00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,950
him I talked to people who said that he

00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:00,399
was did not accept something whatever

00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:04,240
and the third argument is Wikipedia is

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:06,789
not a free saying the dictator you can

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:09,340
memorize pages and they are corrected

00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:12,220
but the problem is some political pages

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,860
in the hand of less left-wing people who

00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:17,649
have non democratic views especially

00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:19,419
there against Nazis that means against

00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:21,759
all Germans we have a different opinion

00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:26,049
that left-wing people so there's no

00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:29,080
democracy you cannot even point to

00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:30,909
somebody on Wikipedia and he is killed

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,379
from the page so let's take these points

00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:35,440
one by one so the first point is about

00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:37,090
the role of a benevolent dictator in a

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,429
project open-source project the second

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,639
question is about controversy

00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:45,220
controversy in in in knowledge and

00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:47,559
propaganda and so on okay I'll take the

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,019
second point first the thing about

00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:52,629
software is that you don't really have

00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,409
controversy in in perspective in points

00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:56,950
of view we're not doing journalism

00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:59,139
luckily and I think with Wikipedia there

00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,990
is this kind of it covers a very broad

00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:04,360
scale it does cover very old

00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:06,759
you know uncontroversial subjects to to

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,409
journalism and there is always going to

00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:12,250
be a part of Wikipedia which is

00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:14,139
extraordinarily controversial if you if

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,940
you're trying to get a single point of

00:29:14,139 --> 00:29:18,100
view you cannot let those in those pages

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,580
however that controversy has to go

00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,159
somewhere

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:24,009
may as well happen may as well be

00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,570
documented and may as well be captured

00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:27,250
in some place in Wikipedia serves for

00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:30,700
that purpose it is a real controversy

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:32,289
let it be documented what we have in the

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,210
in open source community when we have

00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:36,159
controversy is people they fork projects

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,309
and they make competing projects so we

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,840
let people make 5 rocket packages doing

00:29:39,309 --> 00:29:42,539
the same thing if they're arguing about

00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:46,079
the approach

00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:48,269
and then the customers can choose and

00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,129
effectively you get to the market saying

00:29:48,269 --> 00:29:53,369
I prefer that perspective I prefer that

00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:54,869
point of view and that's fine so we try

00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:55,949
to of course we don't say people should

00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:57,239
have one point of view or there should

00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:59,789
be one single way of doing things or

00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:01,379
thinking about things when they start

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:04,109
when there's competition of ideas and

00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:05,549
when there's conflict let the market

00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:07,589
decide make many and keep all the

00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:09,479
freedom to create around that and now

00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:13,259
you come to the role of the dictator now

00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:15,119
I'm probably the largest contributor to

00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:17,429
0 mq I'm still programming all the time

00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:19,440
but I'm not really the one who wrote it

00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:20,969
there was a team that wrote it mostly

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,109
martensitic wrote the first the first

00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:28,349
generations of it my role is mostly been

00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:31,049
lawyer it's mostly been writing RFC's

00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:33,139
and so problems problem solving so

00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:36,269
mostly what I've done over the years is

00:30:33,139 --> 00:30:38,279
use it write about it and from the

00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:40,799
perspective of the users solve the

00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,690
problems in the process rather than

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,419
trying to push through any design

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,579
ideology or push through any kind of

00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:50,729
technical vision I have no technical

00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:53,309
vision if I do I put it away it's mostly

00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:54,569
junk when I've made projects in the past

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,829
with lots of technical vision they were

00:30:54,569 --> 00:31:04,139
garbage very fast beautifully documented

00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:06,389
well written garbage and so when I have

00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:09,239
technical vision I'm very skeptical of

00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:10,559
it and I put it away and I try to get

00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:13,979
the market to tell me what to actually

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,079
make and so I teach people that same

00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:18,869
process kind of you know modesty which

00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:20,639
is hard for me really but I think Holger

00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:23,909
has something on oh one more question

00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:28,919
sir go for it hi is this all yes it is

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:30,919
hi and so this is a sort of a political

00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:32,849
question rather than a technical one

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:34,739
because we're talking about the way you

00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,649
organize people and resources and where

00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:40,379
the power flows and things like that

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:43,349
and it strikes me that the perspective

00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:45,749
that you're talking about is an anarchic

00:31:43,349 --> 00:31:47,399
and I don't mean that in the we're all

00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:48,690
gonna rip our clothes off and hits each

00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:50,909
other over the head with the club I mean

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:53,339
the political philosophy of Anarchy

00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:55,259
which is I guess I'd summarized as being

00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:56,400
the people who should make the decision

00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:58,320
should be closest

00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,870
so the ones are actually going to be

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,120
doing the stuff that effect that there

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:05,340
is the effect of that decision so it's a

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:11,190
very bottom up rather than top-down way

00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:15,450
of doing organizing things my question

00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:18,900
then is did that outlook and perhaps I'm

00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:21,480
wrong in putting that outlook on you did

00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,640
that outlook emerge from the bottom or

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,560
did that start because you thought

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,720
because that's already an existing

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,360
perspective that you have and the way

00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,460
0nq has has developed and in the way

00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:36,120
that you've described in terms of the

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,770
way the project is organized is that

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,660
more a reflection of you in your your

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:45,420
outlook or the group's outlook I think

00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,670
the I think in the terms of anarchy is

00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:50,760
what you call a philosophical Anarchy

00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,490
where there is Authority but anyone can

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,320
choose the authority they like best so

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,640
you could model this in terms of you do

00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,080
have countries and governments but you

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,510
could move to any country you like and

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,860
they're infinitely big and if you don't

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:03,630
like the government and attack systems

00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,800
and the infrastructure move somewhere

00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:10,980
else so there is Authority and there has

00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:15,450
to be Authority the reason is if you're

00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:17,940
trying to work with contracts and base

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:19,470
your collaboration around contracts when

00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:21,780
there's conflict when someone people

00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:24,570
cheat and people do cheat who enforces

00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:27,300
the contracts where's your tribunal

00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:31,500
where's your court you need a monopoly

00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:32,790
of power to stop people cheating so an

00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,860
anarchistic system which doesn't take

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:38,990
into account that you have a small

00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:41,420
percentage of determined cheats

00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:44,100
determined cheats people who are either

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,630
predisposed to always cheating maybe

00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,100
they're psychopathic by nature and they

00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:51,990
will always cheat out of out of born

00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,850
talent or they will be opportunistic

00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,070
cheats who see money on the table and

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,960
who say haha I can steal the money now

00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,600
I'll put my morals aside for a few a few

00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,870
days and cheat those people will be

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:06,210
present and they will do great damage to

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,320
communities like really really serious

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,750
damage and I've been in communities

00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:12,840
large communities which were

00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:14,220
torn apart by a few cheats literally

00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,409
destroyed the work of thousands of

00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,590
people and it's it's a terrible thing to

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:21,450
see and one of those was like the in our

00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,850
anti patent fight the ffiii which I was

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,560
president of and I was trying to run

00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:26,909
this organization by consensus and there

00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,550
were a few guys in organization who were

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:32,429
determined to cheat and because I didn't

00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:33,960
really have the moral authority of being

00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,649
the founder I couldn't tell them to stop

00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,940
and I couldn't convince them to stop and

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:41,520
it told organization in two pieces

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:45,210
it was the terrible trouble thing so I'm

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,929
very pragmatic about identifying sources

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:52,020
of conflict and sources of damage to

00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:53,300
other people's work and stopping that by

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,679
any means necessary

00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:57,510
including real violence if I have to

00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,980
I'll be very brutal to people I consider

00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,770
to be a threat to people I consider to

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,660
be valuable to each other right so it's

00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,450
not Anika's him in a sense of hey let's

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:09,210
all do what we like that doesn't work in

00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:13,500
my experience but the authority is there

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:14,610
to protect not to not to attack and it's

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,360
there to protect the work of the

00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:19,830
collective if you look at if you read my

00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:29,280
book which you should the book is very

00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:32,370
good I liked the book the book came out

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,980
of my work in politics and my work to

00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,540
organize people for politics and I was

00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,310
trying to explain this to others how to

00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:41,670
organize and how to build communities

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:43,920
for political ends and my sister who's

00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,660
who's a professor into the co sciences

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,570
oh you're a Marxist ideology or Marxist

00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:50,970
I'm not a Marxist I'm a free-market you

00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:52,650
know on the and if I'm a free Marcus I'm

00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,000
an Adam Smith's you know I believe in

00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,790
the free market in the beauty of the

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,400
market she's like oh you're a Marxist

00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:00,210
yeah my brother's a Marxist okay I'm a

00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,130
Marxist sir

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:03,720
I didn't grow up to be a Marxist I

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,640
consider myself a right-wing capitalist

00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,080
I'm a businessman like to make money but

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,050
it turns out the best way to make money

00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:12,840
is to make many people happy and it

00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,790
turns out that requires a you know a

00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,530
good efficient market with good rules

00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:20,640
and with you know good authority and

00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:27,060
will come to certain forms of anarchism

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:28,620
not I didn't invent these words so it's

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,350
funny that you just mentioned that you

00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,750
believe in the aaron smith theory the

00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:36,240
but invisible and because I think what

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:39,030
you're missing in your view is that's

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,040
behind power there is people and I want

00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,200
to ask how many woman is in this room

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:47,190
right now because we have to fight our

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,740
way in IT and we have to justify haha we

00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:51,780
are doing that and because I was in the

00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,510
jungle girls project I don't know I

00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:58,220
don't know how it was between them in

00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:00,270
the Python society how it's worked for

00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,410
women to express their point of view but

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,820
in France

00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,820
somebody tried to do something like that

00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:07,620
and was fraught out right so I think you

00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:11,100
are missing that in this room there are

00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:13,460
many male white for most and that behind

00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,010
power there is people and there is this

00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,600
maybe you think that you don't have any

00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,060
oriented view or stuff like that but you

00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,520
you are in the fact you oriented and

00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,510
when you choose to have people like

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,190
doing funny codes you choose to have

00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,440
this guy but maybe it's afraid for

00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:35,430
others so maybe you are missing that

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,440
behind powers there's people so thank

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,800
you for your question I guess to

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,250
paraphrase what you're asking for is how

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,800
this kind of I guess a fairly pragmatic

00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:50,370
process takes two into account diversity

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,970
whether it be diversity of origin or

00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,560
gender or religion or culture whatever

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:57,480
I'm not going to talk about women in

00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,250
software that's a different issue and I

00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,970
thought my expertise I'm a white man I

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,650
have I cannot talk about diversity very

00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,970
much I grew up in many countries my I

00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,320
think my mother language when I was

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,570
young was super hilly as much as it was

00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:12,240
English my wife is Congolese I know

00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:14,460
about cultural diversity but I can't

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:19,710
talk for for women what I can talk about

00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:22,280
is the the work we've done to remove the

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:26,580
preconceptions that filter out

00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:29,120
contributions and I don't know how

00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,040
successful it's been but a lot of the

00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:33,210
the bias that people might have towards

00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,050
a contributor because they know who they

00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,270
are

00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:38,100
you're my friend therefore I like your

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:41,400
patches I don't know you are therefore

00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:44,700
our objective we've taken away if you

00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:47,490
look at our process there is no basis

00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,530
for discrimination in the process

00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:51,660
however what I've also noticed is that

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:55,140
our contributors are more and more

00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,810
dominantly male not from any one country

00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:00,420
we're very around the world very

00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:04,050
geographically diverse but I believe the

00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:07,830
process is a fairly brutal process in

00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:09,240
certain ways fairly competitive and may

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:10,950
have a certain communication pattern

00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,210
that feels pretty masculine that's

00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:17,750
possible is the case and I'm happy to

00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:20,730
get patches and changes and suggestions

00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:24,780
when it comes to the people in the the

00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:27,840
invisible hand in the market what I

00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:31,440
think is is is observable but I think

00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,970
the basis for economics is is that we

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,720
make money we make a market by

00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:38,520
specializing and by trading that's to

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,740
say that diversity doesn't have to mean

00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:42,390
we all do the same thing it we can do

00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,900
many different things and work together

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:51,090
and having different talents in our

00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:52,470
minds makes us valuable right let's just

00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:54,030
a difference is valuable differences

00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:55,140
what makes us valuable as individuals

00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,550
being different for the people is a

00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,410
valuable thing it should be a valuable

00:39:56,550 --> 00:40:00,930
thing if we are free to use that

00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:03,030
difference to trade to connect people if

00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,500
there's no barriers to communication or

00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:08,400
barriers to moving to different place to

00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:11,070
work whatever but more than that I can't

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,500
really I can't really give you any that

00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:18,270
you say that you are you have no bias

00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,310
but when Wikipedia made a survey most of

00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,990
the merits say there is no sexism and

00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:24,000
yours the woman and all the woman said

00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,480
yeah there is sexism so funny that you

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,010
said that

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,510
I mean I'm by course I'm biased I know

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:29,730
I'm biased by definition but I can't see

00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,490
my own bias I couldn't tell you where it

00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:33,960
is I feel that I grew up in I have four

00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:37,140
sisters and I grew up in a family where

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,970
we were we were you know but of course

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,400
I'm biased but everybody in this room is

00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:42,690
biased in different ways that no one on

00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,510
earth is not biased by their own

00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,470
perception of the world and I don't even

00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:48,030
I said

00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:51,210
spec the gender bias isn't even the

00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:53,540
largest bias we have age bias we have

00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:56,430
language buyers have so many biases so

00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,470
you know that's that's kind of reality

00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,150
we live in I don't know how to make that

00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:02,369
into you know more happiness for people

00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,780
except to make more doors to open a more

00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:07,530
opportunity for people to contribute in

00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,900
different ways yeah

00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:13,290
but thank you for that question okay so

00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:17,000
this is the two last questions we have

00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:22,530
five minutes left and Ranchos right okay

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,960
first he came first okay okay my

00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,810
question you said you thought positively

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,560
about the market deciding about their

00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:36,450
own software and not one person making

00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,980
all the decisions I want to cut a I

00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:41,160
would say a quote from the book the

00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:43,560
shallows the writer the system the

00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,540
Dahmer the user you think when the

00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,270
people decide about their software will

00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,849
they always choose the best of software

00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:52,770
for their own benefit what's interesting

00:41:50,849 --> 00:41:54,599
about what we're talking about the

00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:57,480
ability of the market to make decisions

00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:01,440
yes and what I think is most interesting

00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,240
is not so much about the solution for a

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,280
particular problem there are many

00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,260
solutions for problems and we can always

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,820
move around and change solutions what's

00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:11,369
most interesting and what's most

00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,710
valuable and what defines come back to

00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:17,670
quality and software is choosing the

00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:20,190
right problems and solving the right

00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:22,849
problems and solving the biggest

00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:25,589
problems first

00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:26,730
now once you've identified the right

00:42:25,589 --> 00:42:29,010
problem to solve

00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,960
of course you can throw away solutions

00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,210
come with new solutions and what we

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:35,730
really depend on on our community for

00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:38,220
what we what we bet on the community is

00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,470
to identify the right problems in the

00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:41,849
biggest problems and those we solve and

00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:46,770
then the solutions can come and go over

00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:48,510
time their basic much trash right okay

00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:50,940
does that answer your question well

00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,609
certain extent may I can't say it any

00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:56,190
more concrete terms like when people

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:59,040
choose the system that is most easy and

00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:00,180
most the things be under behaves so for

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,559
example if ease of

00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:04,380
is more important in performance that's

00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,150
that's a valid choice I mean everyone is

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,440
making a bet on their own when they

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,720
choose software they're betting their

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,369
time and money on that and of course

00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:13,020
that's valid you can't say no no I know

00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:13,920
better than you but that's your business

00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,950
but I know better than you that that's

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:22,710
that doesn't work so just the code was

00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:25,819
about that their brains will will

00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:28,140
function less over time that was

00:43:25,819 --> 00:43:33,359
negative things that they may choose

00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:36,059
okay thank you yes hello everybody

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,640
yes I'm listening to you and my feeling

00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:41,240
is that we just compare two times of

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,400
management man directive management and

00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:48,000
participative management and my question

00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,460
is quite easy is it not just a question

00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,190
of resources I mean when we speak about

00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:55,800
Linux it was the beginning you have to

00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:59,329
you have few resources and then you have

00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:04,440
to took to go or not look too good

00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:09,180
straight on and it was not so easy to to

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,680
have enough resources to to just who to

00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:13,380
listen to the market because the market

00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:20,130
was just at the beginning when we are

00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:22,530
now at that time in too far today which

00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:25,319
is a community are much larger and for

00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:29,460
that reason resources is much easier to

00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:31,290
to bring and for projects it's much

00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,500
easier to have a participative

00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:36,450
management now okay so the question is

00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,069
whether this is a different management

00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,020
styles yes or no and whether it's a

00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:42,150
question of size or not there is a

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,160
management consultant a long time ago a

00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:45,720
guy called Argyris he has two models you

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,970
can research this Argyris model one

00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,770
Argyris model two and it's worth reading

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,720
about and this is exactly the the

00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,280
dichotomy mortal one is a top-down

00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,569
learning process you learn University

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,270
you learn in workshops you apply in your

00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:59,309
job the model two is a circular system

00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:01,589
where you learn as you work and you

00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:04,200
apply that all the way around it's not

00:45:01,589 --> 00:45:06,420
about scale though those models apply

00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,970
whether you're a team of five or 5,000

00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,710
both models they're quite inconsistent

00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:12,450
you can't make a shift from one to the

00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,410
other very easily they they're competing

00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:15,120
models

00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:17,460
but there are two management styles yes

00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,110
most definitely and this it's not my

00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,430
invention I mean no one invents anything

00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:21,300
we just reuse stuff where we discover

00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,160
the stuff that people have been doing

00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,010
for a long time there are companies

00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,350
which operate and model to very

00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:29,910
successfully an internally they are very

00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:32,820
fluid and they look very strange but

00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:36,810
they're very successful and most

00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:39,450
companies still operating model one okay

00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:41,040
but it's not about size when I began

00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,110
making the community with zmq the goal

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,290
was from the very beginning was to build

00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,520
this kind of a learning you know

00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:50,580
building by learning rather than

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,490
building by dogma and by design just to

00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:57,420
remark I think it's not only human

00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:58,620
resources but kirisaki reduces I think

00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,060
we have to finish there I'm generous I

00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,890
mean Peter is also going to be around

00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:04,950
afterwards so there's a discussion one

00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:08,520
last 20 seconds we are half contains

00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,910
here that decentralized organization

00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,490
works

00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,470
I mean gidget decentralized we do have

00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:16,140
contracts through conflicts the kind of

00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:17,760
things well Alf were there I was

00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:19,740
listening to you and was thinking this

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,950
guy needs to go to this big economic

00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:25,260
forum in the arc where Bill Gates used

00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:27,840
to go and all the big leaders is it good

00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:30,630
because people in power right now they

00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:32,310
need to hear you Ellen they are they

00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:34,320

00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:37,010
mean you're the people I want to talk to

00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,010
