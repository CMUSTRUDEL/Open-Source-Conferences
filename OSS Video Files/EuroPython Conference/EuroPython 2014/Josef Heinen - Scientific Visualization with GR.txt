Python developers often get frustrated when managing visualization packages that cover the specific needs in scientific or engineering environments. The GR framework could help. GR is a library for visualization applications ranging from publication-quality 2D graphs to the creation of complex 3D scenes and can easily be integrated into existing Python environments or distributions like Anaconda.

-----

Python has long been established in software development departments of research and industry, not least because of the proliferation of libraries such as *SciPy* and *Matplotlib*. However, when processing large amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits (*Qt*) or three-dimensional visualizations (*OpenGL*), it seems that Python as an interpretative programming language may be reaching its limits.

*Notes*

Links to similar talks, tutorials or presentations can be found [here][1]. Unfortunately, most of them are in German language.

The GR framework has already been presented in a talk at PyCon DE [2012][2] and [2013][3], during a [poster session][4] at PyCon US 2013, and at [PythonCamps 2013][5] in Cologne. The slides for the PyCon.DE 2013 talk can be found [here][6].

As part of a collaboration the GR framework has been integrated into [NICOS][7] (a network-based control system completely written in Python) as a replacement for PyQwt.
