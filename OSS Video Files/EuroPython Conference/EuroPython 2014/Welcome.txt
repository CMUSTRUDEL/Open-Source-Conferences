Python 2014 with a capital e capital P

00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,850
this is going to be in the guidebook and

00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,140
it's going to be printed around all the

00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,570
place but if you're missing it right now

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:25,940
euro Python 2014 capital e capital P so

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,880
and I see some of you already got their

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,570
backs with the t-shirts if you now

00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:35,360
decide that you perhaps choose the wrong

00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:38,780
t-shirt size it is possible to switch

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,780
the t-shirt but just tomorrow after the

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:44,090
lunch break before it's not possible

00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:47,000
also you can't take it back before with

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,500
you then because yeah we have to make

00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,120
sure that everybody gets a fresh tee

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,040
shirt and we can't guarantee then if

00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,170
somebody brings it back that is not all

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,329
reward so we don't want to have that so

00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,450
if you want to change your mind about

00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:03,200
your t-shirt size just come back

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:05,709

00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,140
introduce you to the chair of your

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,140
Python 2014 Mike Miller

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,870
thank you very much for the introduction

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,960

community meets just to remind you we on

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,470
Berlin welcome to Berlin and it's the

00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,180
year 2014 and obviously if you found the

00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,660
place so I don't need introduced to

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,140
place to you first I want to start a

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:58,410
little bit looking back the European

00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,540
your Python since 2002 and then I

00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,390
discovered some data about this

00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:06,300
conference at the European society

00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,010
website and I use this data and I like

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,840
to program and this why i put a little

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:11,700
programming this talk and actually this

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,770
whole 12 is written I pies notebook and

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,480
so is this a data there and this is a

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,330
the last year of pythons over the last

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,070
year's disease starting 2002 location

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,260
attendees unfortunately we did we don't

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,690
have data for other at times but we have

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,000
a few when this is just the numbers but

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,590
now use a little bit Python we register

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,180
data and put the new dictionaries and

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,780
after we do this we can plot some very

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,320
easily looks like this after we put in a

00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,530
dictionary and then you have a nice plot

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,800
is with matplotlib in you that's how the

00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:49,050
development over there nds per year went

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
over the last year's see we are are

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,980
rising a lot of people are coming to the

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,310
conference and this conference has

00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:58,310
whooping 1200 participants

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,539
okay so so much about the past but we

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,729

the slide as even more but I want to go

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,210
through quickly what what you can expect

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,150
of course the main part or big part of a

00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:56,570
conference or the talks so we have five

00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:58,160
cradle tracks of talks we had about 300

00:08:56,570 --> 00:09:00,080
submissions so it's real enough people

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,940
want to speak unfortunately only room

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,960
for one hundred so that means we had a

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,820
pretty pretty strong review process and

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,260
you can expect very high quality talks

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,210
hopefully you saw it already in the

00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,340
program would be very interesting talks

00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:15,200
I would like to call all of them but

00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:20,540
that they all will be on video so you

conference training session so we have

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,200
training sessions there are two parallel

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,840
trainings tracks so very interesting

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,070
trainings about three hours so if you

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,300
want to get a bit deeper no topic than

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,820
the talk and the training is the way to

00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,560
go and but you need to sign up so you

00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,940
had a chance to do online sign up before

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,620
you might have seen it if you haven't

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,780
done so please go down to the info test

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,770
and sign up if you sign up and you on

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,050
the list you're guaranteed to have a

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,520
seat if you don't sign up you might not

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,990
get a scene in the train I might consume

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,310
space you might be lucky but if you

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:39,589
really want to see a training please

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,940
sign up that helps you and hurts us also

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,610
to plan little bit about the rooms and

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:45,080
stuff like this so please take take it

00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,470
to answer us into those interesting

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,350
trainings and sign up for the training

00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:51,960
sesh for your

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,310
training sessions so we have a lot of

00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,530
things going on one of the things going

00:10:53,310 --> 00:11:01,130
on right now today the jungle girls can

00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:01,130
do goals workshop yes

00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,510
right now at the base level there's a

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,640
there's about 40 40 women learning

00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:15,680
programming this python and django we

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,780
had about more than 300 applications for

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,400
this and but they have limited room

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,860
obviously because we have it like a

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,930
tutor or student range of 123 so if you

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,120
have split rumen limited tutors for sure

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:28,700
and therefore we could only select a

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,110
fraction of them but it's a sponsored

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,790
event so it's free for the participants

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,260
it just once their school application

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,590
they don't have to pay for it which is a

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:37,970
great thing keynotes that lead a lot of

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:40,640
keynotes we start to be sticky notes

00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:42,860
today and I just put the like a hashtag

everybody knows what it means Haskell

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,120
test-driven development something but he

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,580
centralized systems and big data these

00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:55,400
are the keynotes we want to enjoy over

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:57,140
the week and you see the keynote

00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,780

lightning talks lightning talks are are

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,180
very interesting though if you don't

00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:10,040
know lightning talks it's very short

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,620
five minutes per talk and cigar shop so

00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:15,140
there's no no no answer question thing

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:16,520
because mental thing and if you're not

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,780
done by five minutes you be able to know

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,450
the microphone and it's the next

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,680
person's talk you have to sign up so if

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,320
you wanted to give a keynote about

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,740
anything it should be mostly pies and

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,270
related I just go downstairs to the info

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,390
desk there's a flip chart put your name

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,040

00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,620
basis so you put your name in you have a

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,570
chance to get in don't miss the lighting

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,430
talks for many people that's effect one

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,840
of the favorite parts of the conference

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:45,140
and Barrow of never interesting who's

00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,930
ever short and precise and I enjoyed

00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:49,280
them very much poster session so we had

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,510
decided this year's I have a poster

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,040
session do there will be a poster

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:53,330
session this will be today in the

00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,790
afternoons after lunch lab will be

00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,320
posted session and this is your chance

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,690
to talk to offer it's been different

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,120
than the talk the talk is you have if

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,530
you question answers of talk is a poster

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,020
is much more personal because usually

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:07,610
it's just you and the author few people

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,140
and there are a good chance to get

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,290
deeper in the one topic and a discussion

00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:14,120
and also if you opposed to press enter

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:15,650
you will have a chance to introduce your

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,790
post of our quickly with one Centon

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,279
thing you just say your name and the

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,560
title of your post own butts

00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,829
out a few seconds and this is will be

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,939
right after this in this recruiting

00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:26,199
session so if you look at the schedule

00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,550
and find the recruiting station where

00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:28,810
the recruiters in the to stem cells and

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,800
you have a chance to do this so if

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:32,319
you're opposed to percent or take

00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:35,189
advantage because this potentially

00:13:32,319 --> 00:13:38,019
attracts more people to your post or

00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,999
more so I mention it recruitment

00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:42,129
sessions though I just put the three

00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:44,110
main sponsors here they have 44 sponsors

00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,670
and I didn't want the plastic all hyper

00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,379
sponsors you will see it as they're all

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,180
over the place so thank you very much to

00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:51,509
our sponsors they are very important for

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,509
this conference

00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:01,019
I can say this this outs of spawn so the

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:02,100
conference wouldn't be possible as it is

00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,809
now other would have been much more

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,089
expensive or whatever wouldn't even

00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:07,889
happen at all so sponsors RX important

00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:09,540
and there are recruitment session so if

00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:11,160
you're looking for pison job that's a

00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,559
good chance or you wanted to know what

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,879
those sponsors are doing there will be

00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,429
this this recruitment session in the

00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,290
afternoon and they should come and this

00:14:17,429 --> 00:14:21,119
day or every sponsor has a three minute

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,550
short intro with a slight or two about

00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:25,709
themselves and then after this intro

00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,509
doubles is just mentioned poster

00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:29,850
introduction then that will be a poster

00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:31,439
session and this poster session at boobs

00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,179
sorry the poster session will be in

00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:34,529
parallel to the recruitment session so

00:14:33,179 --> 00:14:36,209
all the recruiters will be there be so

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,129
small boost and you can talk to them in

00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,740
person if you're interested please take

00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:42,899
advantage of this this opportunity

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,480
because these of companies are we

00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:46,889
interested in good pison programs and in

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,470
parallel if you if not interested in

00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:51,179
recoupment you can go and talk to the

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,350

00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,610
you see and then you come in in the

00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:04,829
entrance area there was a big boost a

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,449
one level lower there's a nice nice

00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:07,949
place to sit and relax as a nightlight

00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:09,689
world a lot of nice things and a lot of

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,249

to go pipe at us by the booze pot

00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,350
responses because as I said response

00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,579
would help us to run this conference and

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,529
you should speak to them and they had

00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,999
some nice effects I have pencils and

00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,529
they have a lot of organized nice

00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:24,629
gimmick so you might take something home

00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:28,949
for a self-fulfilled kids or whatever

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:30,509
okay that's responsible as a social

00:15:28,949 --> 00:15:32,699
event on wednesday night I've been sold

00:15:30,509 --> 00:15:34,860
as socially it went so at the other be

00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:37,379
very good food I hope they have very

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,509
good food here and also after after

00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:41,579
surgery when that will be a cop so

00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:43,679
downstairs there's a club and for people

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,379
that still have energy left they can

00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,819
come and join the club the great food I

00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,290
say that's a very nice cultural program

00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:52,199
I just put the picture of the guys that

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,540
going to run the program here so looking

00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:56,189
forward for very interesting a program

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,199
also it's a very relaxed atmosphere and

00:15:56,189 --> 00:16:00,869
pretty much everybody will be here also

00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,059
partners on why that so they can be

00:16:00,869 --> 00:16:05,040
different is not so technical conference

00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:06,660
but relaxed and they are still

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,759
possibility as a father you buy extra

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,620
ticket so if you like to somebody just

00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,540

not mistaken here the partner program

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,690
very important so if it didn't come in

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,050
alone that's a chance if you have your

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,190
partner with you or your family to

00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,660
explore berlin so it's pretty

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,650
inexpensive way because it's a big

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,990
package of things you can do including a

00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:33,420

lubricated but we need to know how many

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,760
people there so if you're interested

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,610
either in just taking part a program or

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:43,650
even just one session so if you want to

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,630
have your topic covered go to the

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:48,510
website that will be Ricky you can put

00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,070
your topic in dust registers there i put

00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,390
it up again and then hopefully if you

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,730

passing software on this two days that's

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,800
also park at barcamp so if you if you

00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,150
don't like this kind of very traditional

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,160
format of a conference or if in addition

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:12,930
you like something else and they have a

00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,380
bar camp which is some sometimes called

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:18,480
an unconference so it's a it's a

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,770
different type of conference typically

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,280
give you have one hour sessions and

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:24,510
there's no pre planned schedule or

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,550
so anything people meet in the morning

00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:29,040
and did they decide what they're going

00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,840
to talk about that can be something like

00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,400
more traditional talks that can be very

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,870
open discussion sometimes you want to

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,310
know about the topic and people teach

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,040
you there is a very interesting format

00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,560
and an culture the goat is a spark bar

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,050
can be it was very interesting for me

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,300
and attended a few and all this very

00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:48,150
enjoyable so please come there's a bar

you're interested in this very hot topic

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,800
big data and Python go to the PI data we

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,900
can meet all the folks that are

00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,960

things so about the name tacular testing

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,150
so if you get a name tag they have

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,560
versions with thick of paper and I heard

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,230
those they have some kind of enforcement

00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:43,220
papers or wasn't a little bit thin there

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:45,480
was a small glitch and they printed it

00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,600
picking up the backfield said alrighty

00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,480
