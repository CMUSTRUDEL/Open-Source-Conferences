	holger krekel - packaging and testing with devpi and tox
[EuroPython 2014]
[24 July 2014]

This talk discusses good ways to organise packaging and testing
for Python projects.  It walks through a per-company and an
open source scenario and explains how to best use the
"devpi-server" and "tox" for making sure you are delivering
good and well tested and documented packages.  As time permits, we also
discuss in-development features such as real-time mirroring and
search.

-----

The talk discusses the following tools:

- devpi-server for running an in-house or per-laptop python package server

- inheritance between package indexes and from pypi.python.org public packages

- the "devpi" client tool for uploading docs and running tests 

- running of tests through tox 

- summary view with two work flows: open source releases and in-house per-company developments 

- roadmap and in-development features of devpi and tox 

(The presenter is the main author of the tools in question).
