	Floris Bruynooghe - Advanced Uses of py.test Fixtures
[EuroPython 2014]
[23 July 2014]

One unique and powerful feature of py.test is the dependency injection
of test fixtures using function arguments.  This talk aims to walk
through py.test's fixture mechanism gradually introducing more complex
uses and features.  This should lead to an understanding of the power
of the fixture system and how to build complex but easily-managed test
suites using them.

-----

This talks will assume some basic familiarity with the py.test
testing framework and explore only the fixture mechanism.  It will
build up more complex examples which will lead up to touching on
other plugin features of py.test.  It is expected people will be
familiar with python features like functions as first-class objects,
closures etc.
