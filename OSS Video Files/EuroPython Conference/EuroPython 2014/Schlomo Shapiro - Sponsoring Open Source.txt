as a lightning replacement you will now

00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:27,060
hear showmanship you go on open source

00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:30,099
he's a systems architect and open source

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:44,290
enthusiasts working at mo Scout so give

00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:47,820
him a warm welcome please oh sorry I'll

00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,820
fix the screen mirroring

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:12,340
there you go yes please excuse the wrong

00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:14,830
format I did not prepare this okay and

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,200
the slides are a bit in German because I

00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,950
give this talk last year at the linux

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,950
talk linux tag in Berlin but it's about

00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:25,810
the content not about this lights I'm an

00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:28,210
open-source evangelist at lima beans

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,090
card 24 which is a German real estate

00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,430
listing portal and I'm there for now

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:36,610
about five years and I think it's a bit

00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,340
interesting to tell how to introduce

00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:42,070
open source in a company also on the

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,710
enterprise level and also how to really

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,080
make a company benefit from open source

00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,540
projects and from investing into open

00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,330
source and my personal point of view has

00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,190
always been that open source it's not

00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:57,700
just about enthusiasm it's actually

00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:01,119
about solid business decisions and my

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,360
mission is to combine business mentality

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,390
business decisions with open source and

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:10,270
open knowledge few words about a

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,270
moonbeam scout we have two data centers

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,220
about 1600 virtual machines the

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,340
company's more than 15 years in business

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,620
so we are not a start-up and our entire

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,590
technology stack is based on open source

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,750
solutions mostly Linux of course but

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:28,870
also a lot of Java staff which is almost

00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,490
exclusively open source we have a lot of

00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:34,540
people there are about 200 people

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:36,490
working in IT in 30 cross-functional

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,800
teams so we have a lot of changes going

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,750
on and we are actually big enough that

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,910
we have internal open source projects

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:49,090
which is also an interesting thing how

00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:51,069
to take open-source methodology into

00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:57,910
your company to get things done

00:02:51,069 --> 00:03:02,110
internally well open source sometimes

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,500
has gurus or rabbis or you know the big

00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:08,350
people of open source with long beards

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,060
but in truth open source is a lot about

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,380
money

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,180
and if you look at the open-source

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,220
companies today a lot of them are

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,530
actually about money for example redhead

00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,300
redhead is the largest one of the

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:24,150
largest open source companies and they

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,480
take a big pride in the fact that they

00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,209
make money based on open source and I

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,519
know a lot of other companies a lot of

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,410
them also attending this conference who

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,450
are also actually making money out of

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,150
open source and I think this is not

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,430
shameful I think this is a good thing

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,080
because in the end somebody has to pay

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,660
the salaries of the people doing the

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:49,290
work and to pay salaries you need money

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:53,640
and you know enthusiasm alone doesn't

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,440
feed your family so that's why I think

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,670
in the long term it's a worthwhile thing

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:03,959
to do so why linux and wide open source

00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:06,569
I guess you know this idea linux is just

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,090
a big tool kit and the open source world

00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:11,849
is the bigger tool kit surrounding your

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,459
little tool kit and everybody who likes

00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:17,940
to tinker or play Lego or build stuff

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:22,289
loves tool kits and tools and components

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,930
and the reason for people to invest into

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:28,830
open source is actually to invest into

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:32,430
your own tools and into creating your

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:34,320
own perfect optimized optimum toolkit

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,930
which drives your business much better

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,789
than anything else you could buy and

00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,680
that's the reason why your company

00:04:38,789 --> 00:04:43,080
should be investing into open source and

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,270
that's how you can easily convince any

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,419
boss who things that's a silly idea look

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:54,690
for example at a house when you build a

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:56,850
house when you want a house you want

00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,220
something like that a nice house a

00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:03,240
castle whatever something with a few

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:05,580
windows which looks good and so on but

00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,470
then you go to the commercial companies

00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,990
to the propriety solutions and that's

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:14,250
what you get looks nice on the outside

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,380
like that but they know night comes and

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,720
that's what you get you wake up at night

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,330
and you realize well there's a monster

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,840
in the basement

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:25,460
because there's no operability they

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,699
didn't think about updates they never

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,060
test updates with each new feature the

00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:34,250
old features up to work and so on that's

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,349
what happens with so many commercial

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,560
applications that we run at our site

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:42,370
that a lot of managers started to think

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,680
okay what would be the alternatives and

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,550
the alternatives just the way how to

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,590
deal with that is a bit different

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:57,379
because open source usually looks like

00:05:51,590 --> 00:06:00,500
that right it's a beautiful house it has

00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:04,370
a great design it's just not finished

00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:07,009
and the nice thing about open source is

00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,940
that you can finish it yourself or you

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:12,889
can pay somebody to finish it and that's

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,940
the fundamental difference between

00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:18,379
proprietor software and open source and

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,349
the main challenge when you talk about

00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:24,770
open source in companies is actually

00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:27,199
making this connection from let's invest

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:30,949
into that and let's gain some business

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:33,409
value from that investment and that's

00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:35,440
the biggest challenge because they're

00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:38,949
not they're not like you know huge

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,740
companies like Oracle who will send you

00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:46,000
sales droids or mass and be happy to

00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,979
take your millions of dollars or euros

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,529
they're just individual people there and

00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:55,009
you have to deal with them and that's

00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:57,919
something which takes work and it pays

00:06:55,009 --> 00:07:00,589
to understand how the open source system

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,229
works really differently than the

00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:06,169
commercial software system we've done

00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,969
this many times and we also try to talk

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:11,060
with commercial vendors for example

00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:14,199
redhead about turning backs into

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,550
features or not seeing box as features

00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,860
because what happens a lot is that we

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:22,159
submit about requests and they say well

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,169
that's a feature and if you look at the

00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:26,870
redhead bug tracker you see a few of our

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:29,050
back requests which well they are

00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,210
features

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,460
so the thing is how do you get a

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:37,690
commercial company a commercial partner

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:40,629
to take you serious and the sad truth is

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:43,210
only with money and the even more sad

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:45,819
truth is with much more money than you

00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,860
could ever dream about paying just to

00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:49,539
give you a few figures I know from

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,470
personal experience that linux

00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:56,020
distributions start to build customer

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:59,199
solutions meaning stuff which the custom

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:02,349
actually needs only after you are ready

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,860
to put up several million euro per year

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:08,710
so if you big enough to pay that much

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:13,840
then you can use proprietary software

00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:16,780
and adjust it to your own needs if your

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:21,190
budget is not that large then you better

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:26,229
look into open-source sponsoring and why

00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:28,990
is that interesting because open-source

00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:33,279
sponsoring means you pay money into your

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:35,740
own organization you give money away to

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:38,260
other people but you actually invest

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,510
into your own organization and the

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,899
reason is that with open sores you

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:47,800
invest into knowledge and into features

00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:50,440
and you don't invest into property of

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,920
licenses or into having some license

00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,110
paper which you can paste in the wall so

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,420
any euro you spend an open-source

00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:02,440
sponsoring goes either into a consulting

00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:05,290
or into fixing errors by the way there

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,660
are two types of open-source companies

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:10,779
one they sell you an open-source core

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,209
which is nice and useless and then they

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:15,640
take license fees for the extra features

00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:17,649
and the others they give you everything

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,250
for free and they take money for

00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:23,279
consulting and for fixing problems I

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,500
personally prefer the latter one because

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,980
they don't feel so much pressure into

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,720
buying their add-on products but I can

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,690
also understand the companies who choose

00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,029
to refinance the open-source development

00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:39,910
through selling licenses a famous

00:09:37,029 --> 00:09:42,100
example for that model by the way is op

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:45,100
C and open source

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,800
deployment and automation tool for

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,050
windows desktops there's an open-source

00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,800
core it has commercial add-on features

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:56,110
and as soon as they refinance the

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,759
development of these commercial add-on

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:03,610
features they turn them into open source

00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:05,440
so I mentioned it people here a lot of

00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,170
people this is an open source conference

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,199
please partially and it's all about

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,970
people and the main thing which you need

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:14,470
to understand when dealing with open

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,029
source is you're dealing not with

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:17,139
projects you're not dealing with

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,500
companies who are dealing with

00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:23,829
individual people and individual people

00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:25,660
are individual and they need individual

00:10:23,829 --> 00:10:28,089
treatment and you have to really

00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:30,490
understand the people behind the

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:32,829
projects if you want to interact with

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,610
them or if you want to influence how the

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:37,990
project will be developed and as soon as

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,230
you manage to have somebody in your

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:44,290
company who sees it as their job to deal

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,180
with the people doing open source that's

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:49,600
the moment you will be successful as a

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:55,060
company in utilizing open source towards

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:59,529
your own ends so what do you have to

00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:03,370
deal with mailing lists avoid the flame

00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:05,860
wars they're just a waste of time a much

00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,050
bigger problem is some of the people

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:13,180
doing open-source actually do it

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:15,009
religious for fun hobbyists and that's

00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,319
actually a really tough problem for

00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:19,449
people like me because I've had it

00:11:17,319 --> 00:11:21,550
already there's a great project which I

00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:23,410
would like to use and which just likes

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:26,050
you know this little tiny bit of

00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:29,889
polishing or extra feature or whatever I

00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:33,970
write an email to this person and I

00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:36,639
don't get a reply I write more emails

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:40,959
eventually I get a reply and the reply

00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:43,029
is are not interested like here I'm

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:48,780
waving money but the people are not

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:53,130
interested and that's a big problem it's

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:55,830
crazy maybe but it exists and then if

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:57,960
that happens you a little bit out of

00:11:55,830 --> 00:12:00,630
options because then you can't use the

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,660
main competence on that project the

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,980
author you have to find somebody else

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,080
internally or externally you can take a

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,810
freelancer ask them to work on the code

00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,940
and so on it makes it a bit more

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,010
difficult but things to open source you

00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,840
can actually do that because you can

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:18,180
take the code you can [ __ ] the project

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,120
you can take a freelancer put him on a

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,300
pace of money get the thing solved and

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,360
if your business what you care about is

00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,860
solving problems through money that's

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,450
the core of all business decisions and

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:36,030
with open sores that works quite well

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:39,810
especially if you have open source

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,580
orientated companies and I want to show

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,710
you a few examples of successful

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,770
corporations which we as in abeyance

00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:48,540
card had been doing recently just to

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,340
show you that it is possible to find

00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,620
open source projects which are really

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:54,840
good really important which are backed

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,630
by individuals or by companies who are

00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:00,210
also willing to work with us as a

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:05,040
company and to support their product

00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:08,250
exactly as we need it one thing you have

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:11,670
to care about is the legally stuff and

00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:13,080
the legal pitfalls because especially in

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:15,440
Germany they're different kind of

00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,960
contracts which you can make and

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,600
depending on the type of contract you

00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,030
pay either for the time of the person or

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,420
you pay for the actual artifact being

00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,700
produced and when you pay for the

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,400
artifact being produced then there's a

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,140
big pitfall of warranty and that's why

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,690
many open source developers they don't

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:40,620
want to be paid for a feature they want

00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:43,290
to be paid for time and as a company you

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,270
then have to go with them and say okay

00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:49,290
i'll pay you two days worth of

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:51,090
development for doing support you know

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,980
on the contract you to write support and

00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,380
then you actually ask them to write a

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,790
feature and then it's all okay from the

00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:02,130
legal side and i also was doing this a

00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,430
lot as a consultant and I always told my

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,270
class

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,730
summers I'm supporting you and as part

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:12,510
of that support there will be magically

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:15,240
a new release of my product on github

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,880
which you can then download following

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,060
the you know disclaimers in the GPL so

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,700
that there is no personal volunteer loft

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:28,500
it's a bit Germany legal stuff you have

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:30,839
to know about it then of course your

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,370
boss will be afraid people are afraid

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,910
people are afraid of the unknown and how

00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:43,440
do you overcome fear you make a small

00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:46,740
step let's say you find a small project

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:50,550
where you can take 100 euro of 500 euro

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,370
and get a big improvement something

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:56,790
simple hey there's no spec file or no

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:58,940
debian directory for packaging you pay

00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:01,320
the developer hundred euro he'll add one

00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,320
to make a first step to show your boss

00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:07,709
that okay we paid money we got a result

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:11,700
work out well was great and then you go

00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:16,440
from small steps to bigger steps don't

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:18,540
start open source like don't start open

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:22,589
source sponsoring from a big project it

00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,000
will fail because you as the sponsor in

00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,850
your company will not have the

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,770
experience to do it right and then there

00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,510
will be problems and then the whole idea

00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:32,970
of open source sponsoring will be

00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:40,370
spoiled from starting on a big thing

00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:44,070
start small grow with the experience so

00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,709
what do you need trust and that's again

00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:49,380
back to the people thing I actually met

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:52,680
with a few of the open source people who

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:54,690
work on projects which we're using just

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,550
in order to get to know them that they

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,399
won't seen my face that when we

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,529
exchanged emails it's not just somebody

00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:05,970
anonymous but it's somebody they've met

00:16:01,529 --> 00:16:07,770
before and trust builds bridges and when

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,690
you have a bridge of trust then you can

00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:12,230
actually go further and do also bigger

00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,230
projects

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,980
that's the stuff which is actually a

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,880
very good point for open source

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:22,260
sponsoring because nobody likes to do it

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:28,010
now developer likes to write

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:30,360
documentation nobody likes to work on

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,570
tests which don't produce features

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:37,320
unless you're a test driven friend like

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:40,590
me so when we do open source sponsoring

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:44,520
all our sponsoring contracts have these

00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:47,190
things written into them develop write

00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:50,370
tests document it and create an upstream

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,920
release and we pay actually for the

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,260
upstream release we don't pay for custom

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,440
code here's your tar gz which you can

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,670
install that's not worth anything

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,320
because custom code will not be

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,240
maintained what you want a snap stream

00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,490
release that will be maintained by the

00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,120
original author as he continues to

00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:12,150
develop his project and these actually

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,980
valid points which you can use to sell

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:19,290
open-source sponsoring within your

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:21,209
company because obviously if you have an

00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,800
upstream release that has been tested

00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:25,140
through test automation and is well

00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:28,830
documented then you will be spending

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,040
less internal effort in integrating that

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:35,010
in your platform so you save money by

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,320
spending money at the development site

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,210
you spend internal effort or maybe

00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:41,100
consulting money which you would have to

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:47,180
spend so that's a worthwhile investment

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:50,190
a few examples for my personal past

00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:51,840
openvpn gave a builder was the first

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:55,530
open source project which are launched

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,050
commercially and there was a customer

00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:01,430
who came to me and said I need some

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:05,160
handmade custom VPN configuration

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:09,120
between two computers and asked him well

00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,040
no problem how will you maintain that he

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,130
said I don't know we just switch it on

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,560
and it runs forever which as we know is

00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,660
not a good plan so I came up with an

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,950
idea to create a build system that would

00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,890
generate bootable CD s that you can just

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,690
pop into the VPN endpoints

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,720
and then maintaining it is just

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:33,260
generating a new CD you thought the idea

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,880
is cool sponsored the project and if you

00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,110
google for it you can still find it even

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,120
though it's not maintained anymore

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:43,340
relaxin recover was another open source

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,130
project which is very successful it is

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:51,350
now the de facto standard for Linux

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:53,150
disaster recovery automated and it

00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:57,170
started also small as a small project

00:18:53,150 --> 00:19:00,350
where I offered my customer well don't

00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:04,760
buy thirty thousand euro commercial

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:07,040
disaster recovery tools hire me for

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,870
about half of that and I'll write you an

00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:12,040
open source tool that does the same job

00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:14,810
more automated than the commercial tool

00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,710
so I could do the job cheaper and better

00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:20,060
than the proprietary alternative and

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:23,030
again an open source project which is

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,360
still alive today and the project has

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:28,370
since been extended and advanced through

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,710
many many more consulting projects at

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,930
many customers and they're all very

00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,380
heavy because they pay like a few days

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:39,970
of development and they get a fully

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:43,160
featured tool supporting their personal

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,200
proprietary backup solution so if you

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:51,200
care about disaster recovery check it

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,300
out the prices are really the

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,510
interesting thing here because all of

00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,780
these were cheaper than any other

00:19:56,510 --> 00:20:01,840
alternative that the customer had and

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:05,150
that's a strength of all of open source

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,740
that the initial cost of development can

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,620
be sometimes even cheaper than

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:11,930
alternatives and then of course the cost

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,420
of further development even if it's very

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,400
special for one customer is usually

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:20,450
still cheaper than other alternatives

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,220
and the way how to market that to a

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,890
customer or to your boss if you're

00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,800
working in a company is basically the

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:31,760
trick which you need to do to get open

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:34,120
source sponsoring on the road a few

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:37,170
things we've done a tmobile Scout I

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:42,930
singer probably everybody knows

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:46,320
hands up who knows I singer okay well

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:49,860
it's a clone of NAT Geo's the standard

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,990
monitoring tool I singer has been forked

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,720
already several years ago and is

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,520
maintained by many people around the

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:01,220
world but a German company holds a

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,420
significant part of icinga developers

00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,940
which made it really convenient for us

00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,980
because we could just talk to that

00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,780
German company called net ways some

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,180
people know them and ask them to

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,940
implement a few features to fix a few

00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,610
bucks for example reloading the service

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,460
took ages so we paid them some money and

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:23,250
they redesigned the reloading code

00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,500
internally and then it's now done in a

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:28,410
few minutes also version probably

00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:31,020
everybody knows again there's a company

00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:33,090
actually here in Berlin who hold a

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,370
couple of subversion developers they

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,820
also hold a yearly subversion conference

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:41,310
here in Berlin and we had a few

00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:45,120
compatibility problems with subversion

00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:46,770
1.7 so we asked him to fix it they fixed

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,290
it it cost us a thousand euro and

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:52,140
everybody was happy and that actually

00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:56,490
was a major blocker in rolling out

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:59,370
subversion 1.7 and we could have spent

00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:01,380
days and days internally to try to get

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:03,930
over that but it was much cheaper for us

00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:06,060
to hire that company to fix the code

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:09,470
upstream and create an upstream release

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:13,290
then to deal with it ourselves and

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:15,960
another example is X to go X to go is a

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:17,700
linux terminal server solution which

00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:21,360
allows you to create a terminal server

00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:23,370
and then access that through various

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,680
clients running a Linux Windows and Mac

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:28,470
OS and we're using that in our data

00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,060
center to create a bastion host so you

00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,530
have to first go on this bastion host

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:36,530
and then you can work on all the

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:38,660
platform and again a cool product

00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:42,030
develop a lot of people around the globe

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,010
three developers in Germany and they're

00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:45,900
doing little fixing little bug

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:48,330
improvements little features for us

00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,260
already for several years because we're

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,450
using that on a daily base and

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,090
it's great if you can spend a little bit

00:22:52,450 --> 00:23:00,430
money and fix our big problems which

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:03,670
make this thing work much better we also

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:06,460
have our own open source projects our

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:08,800
biggest open source project is yet an

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,900
Augmented deployment tool it's our

00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,210
deployment chain which is completely

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:15,580
open sourced and it manages everything

00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:17,230
in our data center how we roll out

00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:20,050
software how we do configuration

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,060
management its package base it's a

00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:27,490
little bit different from what you maybe

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:29,890
know from other tools and why did we do

00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:32,890
that because as a company we learned

00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,720
that open source space is a company we

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,750
learned that investing into open source

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,420
pace and that sharing what you're doing

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,880
is actually a benefit because you get

00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:45,850
feedback you get patches you get back

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,520
reports and that's the way how you can

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:51,850
simply extend your internal development

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:54,220
force with external help and of course

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:58,300
reviews and code reviews and questions

00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:01,240
and so on so yes if you managed to

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,490
establish open source in a company then

00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,130
the next step is to start internal open

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:08,770
source projects and to take your own

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:16,060
code and show it to the world and be

00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:19,350
part of the open source community I'm at

00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:19,350
the end I hope

00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:30,930
I hope I managed to convince you a

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,350
little bit more to use open source not

00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,640
only for fun but also for business I

00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:38,160
hope I was able to give you a few

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,010
arguments to take home and I hope we

00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:42,960
still have time for a few questions yes

00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:48,110
thank you for stepping in for Kenneth

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,110
and yes we will have some questions

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,020
thanks for the talk so as a developer

00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:10,140
how would you try to fit some kind of

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:13,590
custom requirement from a where customer

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:18,030
in the open source project if it's not

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:20,190
really what was designed for well this

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,010
is a good question if you look at relax

00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:26,160
and recover this project has been faced

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,950
with that question many times and our

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:32,220
philosophy is anything that doesn't harm

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:34,590
other people is most welcome and the

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,830
code is highly modularized so that it's

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,420
really easy to implement something which

00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:44,250
will be run only in a very specific

00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:46,560
scenario so we say please write it so

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:49,140
that other people don't suffer from your

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,240
peculiarities and then you're welcome to

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,550
put your code into our project so that

00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,190
when you deploy our software in your

00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,660
environment you get out of the box a

00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:00,980
working solution and don't have to

00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:04,530
extend it with some local stuff ok nice

00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:08,130
another question if you are paying is

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:11,220
that a developer was not the also to

00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:15,540
work on a project how do you still kind

00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,820
of try to make it go upstream if the

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:22,680
original also is not interested in your

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:26,910
in the patch that your guy is doing well

00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:30,300
we actually in the contracts we pay for

00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:32,820
upstream releases so in some cases we

00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:37,840
split the contract into the functional

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:40,360
part and into an extra added money

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,250
for getting an upstream release so that

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,080
we really pay for the work of the

00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,059
communication with the author and of

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,980
convincing the author to accept this

00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:53,710
code because that is actually work yeah

00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:56,890
and there's a very last thing if you

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,870
need something very quickly it takes

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,450
time to get something in upstream

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:06,640
release so how how would you do that

00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:09,100
yeah well if you take subversion as an

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,120
example it took less than a week from

00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,590
initial contact contract fixing the

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,460
thing and creating an upstream release

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:22,320
but yes the people working at this

00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:26,500
company can ask my slides back please

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,720
the people working there actually are

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,330
part of the core team so they can just

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,100
create a release if they want initially

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,380
they told us all we have to talk with

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,779
all the team and all the project has to

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:42,669
agree that we make a release in the end

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:44,679
it was no big deal okay okay okay we

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:51,360
have to finish and there's a general

00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:51,360
announcement following thanks a lot

00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,520
