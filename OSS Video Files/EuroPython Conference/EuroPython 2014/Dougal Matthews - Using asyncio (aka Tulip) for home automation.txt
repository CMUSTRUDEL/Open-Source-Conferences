Description: 
	Dougal Matthews - Using asyncio (aka Tulip) for home automation
[EuroPython 2014]
[25 July 2014]

This talk will cover the new asyncio library in Python 3.4 (also known as Tulip) and will use the area of home automation as a case study to explore its features. This talk will be based on code using Python 3.3+.
Home automation is a growing area and the number of devices and potential applications is huge. From monitoring electricity usage to the temperature inside or outside your house to remote control of lights and other appliances the options are almost endless. However, managing and monitoring these devices is typically a problem that works best with event driven applications.
This is where asnycio comes in, it was originally proposed in PEP 3156 by our BDFL, Guido van Rossum. Asyncio aims to bring a clear approach to the python ecosystem and borrows from a number of existing solutions to come up with something clean and modern for the Python stdlib.

Home automation is a growing area and the number of devices and potential applications is huge. From monitoring electricity usage to the temperature inside or outside your house to remote control of lights and other appliances the options are almost endless. However, managing and monitoring these devices is typically a problem that works best with event driven applications.

This is where asnycio comes in, it was originally proposed in PEP 3156 by our BDFL, Guido van Rossum. Asyncio aims to bring a clear approach to the python ecosystem and borrows from a number of existing solutions to come up with something clean and modern for the Python stdlib.

This talk will introduce asyncio and use it within the context of home automation and dealing with multiple event driven devices. Therefore we will cover asyncio and the lessions learned from using different devices in this context.

Some of the devices that will be used include:

 - Raspberry Pi
 - RFXCom's RFXtrx, USB serial tranciever.
 - Owl CM160 electricity tracker.
 - Oregon scientific thermometers.
 - Foscam IP cameras.

This talk will also briefly cover the previous solution I used which was developed with Twisted and compare it briefly with my new code using asyncio.

	00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:27,130
okay I'd like to introduce Dougal

00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:31,210
Matthews to you okay Dougal is currently

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:32,980
one of our PyCon UK guys and two months

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,720
time that may be different because he

00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:41,829
comes from Scotland and in contrast to

00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:45,520
Germany which has unified we seem to be

00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:48,039
possibly deconstructing in the UK so

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:59,559
after that we make all the diss united

00:00:48,039 --> 00:01:01,929
kingdom anyway carry on thanks John cool

00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:03,640
and yeah so I'm a pike from eastern of a

00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:05,920
skier that's like to my favorite things

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,159
and as John said I'm Dougal i live in

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,460
glasgow i am developer redhat where I

00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:14,080
work on OpenStack so day today and

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,860
that's my twitter it's Dougal with a

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,509
zero rather than 0 but yeah and that's

00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:23,020
my github and various other things as

00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:24,399
well but this projects nothing to do

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,390
work this is obviously like a side

00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:28,030
project of mine something I've been

00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:32,170
working on for around six months on and

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,790
off and that kind of thing so just sort

00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,189
of to talk about home automation our

00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,689
first of define what it is about the

00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:40,180
motivation and interest me the things

00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:41,649
I'm surveilling to do and I kind of like

00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,930
to split into three different categories

00:01:41,649 --> 00:01:45,460
so the first ones monitoring it's like

00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:48,759
what is happening now in my house and

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,270
what what is the temperature how much

00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:54,219
electricity am I using right now the

00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:55,960
next one is historical data so this is

00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:58,000
of collecting this over time and

00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,320
hopefully identifying trends and

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,530
learning something from it and then

00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,810
adapting this one will take a lot longer

00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,000
to pay off I probably don't quite have

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,750
enough data yet because seasons change

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,920
things so much and how use of behave and

00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,270
then the last one is pretty obvious is

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,440
controlling so it's like I want to turn

00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,420
the lights on I want to turn something

00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,010
off I want to sort of turn off power

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:21,430
sockets overnight because I'm not going

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:24,490
to be using the TV been like between 2

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,810
a.m. and six a.m. or something ever and

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,090
you can just stop things using a bit

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:31,530
power on standby

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,569
kind of the things I've been doing so

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,450
yeah then foremost set up the brains of

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,590
operation at the moment is a rusty pipe

00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,330
I've actually bought a big old own black

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,260
that I'm going to move to just for a bit

00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:44,519
more speed essentially and then the sort

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,890
of the core communication of everything

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,280
is using a device from a company called

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,470
rfx calm which is a TRX our effects

00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,379
radio transceiver so I use that for

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,150
sending and receiving and communicating

00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:02,970
between all these devices it's a radio

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,840
device no works on 433 megahertz and one

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,280
of the things that surprised me about

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,160
getting into this is how many companies

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,000
make devices which work on this

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,049
frequency and that's been quite nice

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,430
because I kind of figured I'd have to

00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,470
support a bunch of other things but so

00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,790
far I've managed to avoid it and I might

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,709
look into bluetooth low energy because

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,860
it's quite neat but for now it's not

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,239
really on my radar fully so just to sell

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:26,099
quickly go through the devices and what

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,040
you see what they are this is what the

00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,480
the actual radio thing looks like it's

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,970
not particularly attractive but it works

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,090
well and it's um it's a serial device of

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:41,519
what the watch over us be so you can

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:42,930
just see the the micro USB input and oh

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,819
yeah it works well but the only thing I

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,760
have issues i live in like a really old

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,670
house from like 1,900 oh sorry 1920s

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,290
actually say and some of the walls

00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:56,069
really block the signals but otherwise

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,040
it's really good then for electricity I

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:01,049
use there's a company called owl and

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,329
they make this device which is the LCM

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:04,829
160 I think and basically there's a

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:06,299
little clip on the left that you can

00:04:04,829 --> 00:04:09,269
attach to the cable going to your

00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,980
electricity meter and in every minute it

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:13,169
sends out a packet which is got like the

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,870
current watts and the total watts and

00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:19,229
then you can just pick this up and I'll

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,239
show you that in a minute and you can

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:22,320
get display with it it's this kind of

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,150
its more expensive you fight with

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,349
display side if you're actually quite

00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,639
serious about doing some of this stuff

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,930
I'd recommend not getting it i got it

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,639
originally because i wasn't sure if i

00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,840
get bored of this project so i want to

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,630
do at least be able to see the data

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:37,530
somewhere because otherwise it's useful

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:40,229
suggest having radio waves then

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,770
temperature humidity is again pretty

00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:43,229
boring

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,349
terms of looking a device and it updates

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:47,610
every minute again so roughly and it it

00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:49,199
just spits out the temperature and

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,250
humidity of wherever you have left it

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,680
I've got these kind of scattered around

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,349
my house so you can come start to see

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,940
what's going on in different rooms and

00:04:54,349 --> 00:05:00,120
then sockets and light switches from a

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,569
company called lightwave RF these are

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,330
just remotely controllable so you can

00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:08,400
turn them on and off I or the one thing

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:10,560
I should have made a bit clearer and so

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,090
the electricity readings and the

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,220
temperature humidity they are

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,750
transmitted only you they basically send

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,909
a message and assume somebody is going

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,220
to receive it with the switches and

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,479
sockets they are receive only so you

00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,789
kind of have to send something and

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,080
assume they've had you and the way it

00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:26,550
works is you put them into a learning

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,380
mode and you send a command with an ID

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,240
they remember that ID and then if you

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:36,569
send a game with the ID they will they

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:40,340
will listen to you and so how this to

00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:40,340
kind of have a give you an idea of how

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,969
how the one thing sort of the data looks

00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,639
like this is an example packet coming

00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,449
from one of the electricity devices it's

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,310
I'm kind of going through this stuff

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,360
fairly quickly because it's done it's

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,280
not that interesting but I didn't want

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,770
anyone to have a like not really

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,330
understand why I was using at all or

00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,400
like how it worked underneath the sizes

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,009
now let's say they kind of take away

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,409
from this bit so this is it's an 18 bite

00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:05,909
packet and this there's a sort of a

00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:08,159
similar study for them but they vary

00:06:05,909 --> 00:06:12,270
after the first four bytes so the first

00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:14,069
fight the x11 tells you there's a 17 x

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,590
packet so it's the length of the packet

00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:20,370
but excluding the first point and then

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,960
5a is the Sosa hex for the the list of

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,870
the family of devices so I know it's no

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,940
just a monitor and then 01 tells me that

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,650
it's that specific owl and then after

00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,389
that it can vary depending on the first

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,659
23 who some things we've ever really

00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:35,819
look into the spec and that's quite hard

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:38,370
to get your hands on the the guy who

00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,069
makes the they are FX calm you can get

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,779
the of the SDK but you've gotta sign an

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:46,289
NDA for it so you can't actually give

00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:47,669
out the the SDK to anyone else his

00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,020
reason being is he doesn't want anyone

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:51,479
to ask some questions isn't a real

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,370
programmer and he just does not want to

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,340
support this thing basically

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,780
anyone else yeah and that at the bottom

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,580
now that thing just shows the actual

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,500
extracted data from that packet so the

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,300
the cid the total what's the current was

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,530
that's basically all you get out from

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,010
that there's other things like battery

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,669
level but yeah I mean that's the

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,139
interesting data and with a system like

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,850
this we basically the whole thing is

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,250
like an event stream and there's just

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,110
stuff happening all the time and you

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,760
just have to sort of react based on what

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,380
what's going on so some of these are

00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,880
like incoming and some are outgoing so

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,169
the likes is like an outgoing thing I'm

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,000
sending that message to say i want to

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,370
turn on a light then i get readings from

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,080
a room some of a monster in one room and

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,360
so on and then an electricity reading

00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,650
and it just continues over and I over

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,410
know so that's that's plain what drew me

00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:41,520
to something like async I oh well I kind

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,930
of wanted an event which I wanted

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,030
something where I could react on events

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,039
I don't seem like quite an obvious match

00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,389
to me but then I wanted to play with new

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,639
stuff so that's what actually brought me

00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:54,660
to a sankyo and never said move on to

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,520
that part of the talk and this is how

00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,590
the bike and documentation describes a

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,150
sinker I personally don't find that a

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,910
very useful description its kind of

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:06,479
unless you are already familiar with a

00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:09,330
lot of the internal terminology it

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,340
really is kind of confusing Daniel poked

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,990
on a talk earlier this week he went into

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,000
a lot of more detail in sort of event

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,039
loops it was actually the titles a G

00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,919
aventyl but he went a lot more detail

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,479
about event loops and how salvation guy

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,800
works so if you want to really

00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,210
understand that and a lot more depth you

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,340
should watch that one check out there's

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,710
a some good talks by greed 01 on a san

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,419
kayo as well it's fairly new so there's

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,860
not a huge amount out there but there

00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:38,849
are some good videos but basically i

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:40,909
thought the the dumb really dumb down

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,169
version of what an event with his

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,630
dispatches sorry waits for and

00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:51,450
dispatches events and then calls an

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:52,980
appropriate hander 4000 and ok and just

00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,510
served before I move on to this because

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,310
one of the things about i synchro is its

00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,900
python3 do it can ever little show of

00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,790
hands of who's using Python 3 at the

00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,410
moment so I've been in work your

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,959
anything ok it's this one number and

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,889
give you a hand up if you have used a

00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,889
sink i oh

00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,600
alright so that's probably about half

00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:10,559
the Python 3 people so you're all in at

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,449
least three point three then so that's

00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:19,410
good right and yeah so this Lou constant

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:21,839
code this first for example here is it's

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:23,749
kind of a dumb down example it's just

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,589
bike then right there's no nothing

00:09:23,749 --> 00:09:27,629
non-standard here this is a nascent

00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:30,839
curry at all one of the things that

00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,220
Guido's of pushing for is that the async

00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:34,410
our code should just read like normal

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:36,269
Python when you strip everything out so

00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:37,709
I kind of proved this fact by going to

00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,209
the documentation taking one of the

00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:42,149
Racing car examples removed all the

00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:44,809
instant a Cinco special bits and now it

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,679
just works like a normal nor little code

00:09:44,809 --> 00:09:48,389
so basically what we're doing here is

00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,819
where we've got function which calls out

00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:53,759
to an expensive Kim view function and

00:09:50,819 --> 00:09:54,899
then we would get a result from that so

00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,179
just to turn that into like a

00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:00,600
non-blocking operation you just need to

00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:03,720
do a few minor adjustments so you'll see

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,970
here that we so we've put on a decorator

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,799
on each function and then when calling

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:09,149
the expensive sorry we're calm and

00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:11,399
compute and when Colin asleep we use a

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:14,819
yield from so basically when that

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,369
happens we suspend the Cobra team so

00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:19,410
we'll go into print we'll get to the

00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:21,509
results and when it yields to compute

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,919
that will then be suspended and then we

00:10:21,509 --> 00:10:24,689
go into the computer for Madrid and then

00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,850
it is suspended when it gets to sleep

00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:28,829
and then it kind of moves up and down

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,149
the skype like that so i'll just quickly

00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:31,679
skip back again so you can kind of see

00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:32,999
the difference because it's really it's

00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,360
fairly small though they're really quite

00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:37,799
similar apart from the decorator the

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,889
yield from and then there's a little bit

00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:42,329
down at the bottom which kicks off the

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:44,309
event loop which is kind of ugly I think

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:47,399
but you only really do typically once

00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:52,079
per app you can use multiple event loops

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,189
but that's a fairly advanced feature so

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,139
to move on to something that's a little

00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:58,619
bit more relevant to why I've been doing

00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:01,319
I'm I never actually measure this device

00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:03,269
because it's really quite simple stuff

00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:04,679
but I've got like a webcam which you can

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,410
just access over the network so you can

00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,299
just make a request to a URL grab the

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,549
image and then store it and why I was

00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,769
trying to do is I wanted a recent image

00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:15,779
that we just store them and have it

00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,480
a convenient place so I update every

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:19,829
five seconds and I just have one is so

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,819
what I want to view the live stream

00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:22,439
that's fine but I don't want to load

00:11:20,819 --> 00:11:24,720
that on every page I want to like a nice

00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:26,339
recent image just to show in someone

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:32,100
does in the website which I'll show

00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:34,170
later result yeah so basically i'm using

00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,629
here i'm using these basic I oh there's

00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:39,089
another library called aio HTTP which is

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,920
like our eastern KY o requests clone

00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:44,429
essentially and then there's an e cinco

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,790
Redis library which again is just like

00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:52,619
another another library employees i go

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:54,209
to interactive Redis and it this is

00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:56,040
actually one of those of the pain points

00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:57,389
that I find were working with these

00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,829
encourage you suddenly have to start

00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:00,899
looking for libraries which support the

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:02,970
poetry protocols in the way that it's

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,379
working to you've got to kind of rethink

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,420
things and it's like you assembly back

00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,769
it a really small standard library I'm

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,119
sorry not standard library a really

00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,149
small ecosystem of things you can use

00:12:09,119 --> 00:12:13,589
they'll be non blocking but again if you

00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:15,929
read this function you will find that

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:17,910
its really fairly straight forward to

00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:19,649
read so if you ignore the co routine

00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,360
decorator and the yield from it's a

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:25,470
simple procedural code which would

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,990
otherwise work as normal but instead

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,329
it's gone it's yielding to creating the

00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:31,379
connection that's yielding to

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,170
downloading the image and then yielding

00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:36,569
to the red of social non-blocking and

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,799
then it just repeats every five seconds

00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:39,480
so I'm just pulling down an image every

00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,970
five seconds I've got stored in Redis

00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,860
which is convenient although I actually

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,939
stopped using this approach this is

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,619
something I was just messing around with

00:12:44,939 --> 00:12:47,790
but I thought he should demonstrate it

00:12:46,619 --> 00:12:52,019
quite well there's a bunch of different

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:53,639
libraries are useful and the main reason

00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:55,350
I was trying to do is I didn't want to

00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:56,850
write to an SD card and the rush peopIe

00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:04,439
every five seconds and eventually burn

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:08,819
the finger ok so Python rfh com is a

00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:10,259
nascent cairo-based library for working

00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:14,970
with the the radio device so this is

00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:16,709
something that I've been writing there

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,509
are other Python libraries for working

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,639
with the our folks calm but there are no

00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,350
other a sinker libraries and some

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,910
there's one that uses twisted and I

00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,470
they've actually done a reasonable

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:27,070
abstraction for the transport protocol

00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,480
so I did think about

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,540
just writing a difference of transport

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,760
for it but some of the code choices I

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,310
kind of objected to so I I decided to

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,060
write my own and I selva a rage quit

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:42,040
when it started suppressing errors but

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,270
having since I wrote this myself it's

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,300
failing you and it's currently limited

00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:47,830
to devices I support but it is working

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,710
fairly well and I'm adding things when

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:56,740
people are self helping me up with

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:58,900
testing so the the problem i found is

00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,060
when i got into this as new ta sunkaro

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,910
and i walked straight away into the the

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,710
callback trap it's kind of like the the

00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,350
very simple model and this is kind of

00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,150
ugly easily in this particular app is

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,950
really fairly simple so I'm basically

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:15,520
setting up the transport I'm passing it

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:17,320
the serial device i want to read and the

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,510
event we've been running on and then the

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,700
call back i want to be cold it works

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,260
fine but it just doesn't it doesn't

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,570
really feel very how again and it's in

00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,550
this of a a bunch of pitfalls with

00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:29,380
callbacks any kind of the biggest one

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:33,160
really is it breaks out of your standard

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,450
Python development flow I'm still

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,770
working on a better solution for this

00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:38,740
and if there's anyone looks like

00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:41,170
familiar with a sinker oh then I would

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,090
love some healthy the problem is some of

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,520
the api's are restricted to call backs

00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,740
only so i use the low-level function for

00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,180
calling the file descriptors and that

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,420
expects a call back so i need to somehow

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:54,520
go from i1 this call back when I can

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,320
read the serial device but then I want

00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,300
to move to this FG generators and

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:07,750
futures and I found out a bit tricky so

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:09,250
far so this is showing another example

00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,600
this is something that I've actually

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,090
found quite useful with the yield from

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,620
is you can be more explicit about how

00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:19,360
you so when you yield to the event loop

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,390
it allows you to do a combination of

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,950
blocking and non blocking operations so

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:26,140
this is actually kind of student life in

00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,820
which is just copied and then reduced

00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,160
down a bit from the code because when

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,440
when doing the setup of the radio device

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,450
I need to reset it and then I've gotta

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,850
wait a period of time and then send a

00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:40,540
status packet to check that it's already

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:42,310
and if you get the timing of this wrong

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,750
just doesn't work right so I wanted to

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,610
be more blocking in the way I was doing

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,470
it but then afterwards I wanted to not

00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,480
be blocking so it kind of switches to

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:52,150
then using the yield from where I set

00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:57,790
the mode which is how I enable and

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:59,260
disable different protocols and I'm not

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,760
sure how you do something like this in

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,890
CG event when you want to have a mixture

00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:09,060
of things when you've got and of the

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:11,380
monkey patching happening so for the

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:13,420
that's kind of like the data collection

00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:14,530
and how I've been working with that kind

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,070
of thing and with the actual physical

00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:19,420
devices and then presenting the results

00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,760
on a dashboard I've written so it's a

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:24,940
fairly simple web app and and it's it's

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,680
kind of a side to the the the the best I

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,080
find interesting the talks I'm kind of

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,280
skip over this fairly quickly it uses

00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:34,030
flash predecessor alchemy bootstrap and

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:38,050
basically it's just a way of viewing

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:39,430
this data so graphing it so i've i've

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:40,780
got like I saw the simple time series

00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:42,550
which I implemented although that turned

00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,520
out to be a big mistake you have to say

00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:47,590
to write your own and and all the code

00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,940
for this is on my github so if anyone

00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,950
actually wants to dive in or try and use

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,240
it they can do the code is riffic this

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,650
has been kind of like the dashboard it's

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,120
going to be like my play area and I'm

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,490
slowly spinning stuff off to actually

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:06,310
make more reusable stuff which is tested

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:08,190
and not just terrible yep no yeah that's

00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:10,930
kind of why I'm glazing over it's just

00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:12,790
yeah it doesn't just for the mic it

00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:15,340
doesn't use falasca tool which is the

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:20,980
sorry it doesn't use a sim cairo in the

00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:22,450
flask web app yeah so this is kind of

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,070
the results of what I'm seeing so this

00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,500
is just like the the default view which

00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:28,540
shows you the the 24-hour period of

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:31,810
what's going on in my house and I kind

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:33,460
of canal to remove some of it sent more

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:36,550
sensitive information but you can get an

00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:39,370
idea so that's like the LGC uses

00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:41,020
aggregated over the day and at the top

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,090
and then that's the sort of the current

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,080
readings at the bottom so you can kind

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,460
of see things happening like when

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,480
nothing's been turned or you're boiling

00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,790
a kettle you get huge spikes and the the

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,110
one I try and get down as long as

00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,070
possible is at the beginning there's a

00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,390
server idle period why

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:57,820
were sleeping on one night in the house

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,080
and that's really when you're wasting a

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:01,960
lot of energy a lot of the time just

00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,070
because there's nothing you so the

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,980
things are happening and you're not

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:07,630
there to take advantage of it and

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,760
they're just to show another graph we've

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:11,710
got the this is humidity and temperature

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,570
it was in my lounge it was like when we

00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,270
had a really hot period we do have them

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,740
occasionally in Glasgow and as the

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,330
afternoon comes around the Sun goes

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,010
right into the living room and it just

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,010
thought you see the temperature rock up

00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:29,380
ok so to sort move them to some of the

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,750
lessons I've been learning with this

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,000
project I'm finding a synchro is pretty

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,380
nice to work with but it does feel quite

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,360
an over low level this is one of the

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,160
actual points of it they want the idea

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,280
is to have further abstractions added on

00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,390
top so I'm hoping that say twisted is

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,880
probably going to support it and that my

00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,930
eight their port 2 pi/3 I don't have a

00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,490
clear they're actually doing that but

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:53,200
I'd be surprised if it's not on the

00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,060
cards at some point the ecosystem is

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,710
young so it's at the moment it's quite

00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,910
it's quite tricky doing things there's

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,180
not a huge amount of examples or

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,770
documentation out there so when you're

00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,530
learning about cinco is kind of tricky

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,690
and most people are doing a building

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,370
like services or they're doing I guess

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,650
network traffic and things there's not

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,300
really anyone else like found doing so

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,490
serial devices or missing around with

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,590
these particular API so if you go

00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:19,780
looking for examples in github I can

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,730
find how to scrape websites that's fine

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,470
but ya doing some of this doesn't isn't

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,730
really that popular with Python 3.4

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:30,250
right yeah and the other sub the key

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:32,620
thing is I should have used graphite for

00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,330
my my data collection and writing your

00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,160
own Redis time series is actually fairly

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,220
easy there's just a bit of a pain in the

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,570
asses you want to maintain it and yeah

00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,430
the reason I didn't I was just being

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:43,990
really lazy about actually going south

00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:45,520
and I just wanted something running so I

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,550
started just inserting data into post

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,990
grads and it's kind of slowly moved but

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:56,560
Redis on the Raspberry Pi is actually

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:58,150
still unreasonably slow and okay I think

00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,160
I've kind of touched on most other

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:03,220
things but the the co routines of

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,480
futures is something that when you're

00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,850
working with them they feel a lot nicer

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,750
to work with so there was some in my

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,070
examples I

00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,360
we didn't call them out that well

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,790
whether these are the difference between

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,770
the two but the problem with as I've

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:16,840
seen with the api's is is it's hard to

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,520
know how you can use callbacks and

00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,710
futures when the documentation is

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:22,510
especially just defining only call back

00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:25,810
so they kind of confusion v2 is I mean

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,670
tricky and that's why really is about

00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,140
everything for me so I went through that

00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:32,010
little quick but yeah be happy to take

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,010
some questions if anyone has

00:20:42,639 --> 00:20:51,950
have we any questions ok just don't just

00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,769
a quick question what sort of them

00:20:51,950 --> 00:21:01,129
money's involved in these oh it's a

00:20:54,769 --> 00:21:03,409
hobby 100,000 how spend a few hundred I

00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:04,700
guess I I could actually go and find I

00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:05,869
can give you a link style devices you

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,779
can find them there they're pretty easy

00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:10,279
to buy on Amazon it's tricky knowing

00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:12,549
what is compatible which is partly why I

00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:14,840
wanted to list everything at beginning

00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:15,859
ba does get quite expensive because

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,799
you're kind of like ooh I could just buy

00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:20,239
another one of these but yeah it's an

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,559
expensive hobby so I'm definitely not

00:21:20,239 --> 00:21:26,749
saving money by coming down my

00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:29,080
electricity's it yet okay I have a

00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:31,519
question as well are there any suitable

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:34,220
devices for monitoring gas consumption

00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:36,139
so this is this is kind of odds because

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,639
is like there's an area blocked out on

00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:39,349
the spec for it and there's actually is

00:21:37,639 --> 00:21:42,619
to find how it will work I can't find

00:21:39,349 --> 00:21:43,700
anyone selling them so I've been trying

00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:45,889
to think of creative ways to do this

00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,559
only option I thought of as a webcam and

00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:55,460
OCR in the number of it that's seems a

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:59,029
bit crazy Heidi go so yeah um so you've

00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,739
white up your house your plugs that you

00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:03,590
can ping and you know what about the

00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:05,749
security of all this so I could drive up

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,269
by your house and switch everything off

00:22:05,749 --> 00:22:10,580
perhaps in theory you could do some of

00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:14,960
that V so the range isn't that great on

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:17,119
the other devices yeah so a view south

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,669
siding you listen to the packets I was

00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,200
sending and then you you just need to

00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:22,519
take the ids and then you could turn

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,919
things on enough you you wouldn't know

00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,179
what you are turning on enough

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,070
necessarily that'd be kind of kind of

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:31,009
fun to watch the lights switch-on and

00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,809
often now i know one of my friends is

00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,759
undoing a similar thing but he's been

00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,440
doing no Jess and stuff and I was

00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:38,179
considering going out and like trying to

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,440
troll them just like saying up a roughly

00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:41,119
pie with like your battery packing

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,389
things take the car out nice to his

00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,619
house and see ya and given that this

00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:47,029
talk is being live-streamed on the

00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:48,529
internet will be available on YouTube

00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:49,190
you don't have any concerns about the

00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:53,810
eye

00:22:49,190 --> 00:23:06,790
I don't think I put in my dress fit good

00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:10,070
point good point thank you very much um

00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:12,320
what about higher level web frameworks

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,590
and I think I oh do you know if

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,090
anybody's doing any work on doing that

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,900
sort of thing in Python in the moment

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:19,910
and if there's anything that's

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,970
particularly difficult about that I

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,350
don't really know to be honest I did

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:29,300
spot I think that somebody has done a

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,350
port of flask they just seem like i like

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,840
i was already feel like I've been

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,010
learning a bunches as a web developer or

00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,470
there's kind of bytes and stuffs that

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,700
they be odd to me so I feel like I've

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,550
been learning a lot and then I started

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,740
looking at Mexico web framework options

00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,750
and I was like I have time for this side

00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:48,590
just one with the the flask approach

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:50,750
which he seemed simple enough but I've

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,520
actually been kind of regretting that

00:23:50,750 --> 00:24:02,150
away because I then ended up writing my

00:23:52,520 --> 00:24:04,070
own rest framework on top of last row so

00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,450
ideally why want is an async I rest

00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:13,240
framework because I can just give the UI

00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:16,430
all in JavaScript I'd be much nicer hey

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,560
you said something by the gas meter

00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,810
reading just now about an idea of

00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,970
looking at it with a webcam I don't know

00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,260
if your gas meter is also from the 20s

00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,480
then you're probably out of luck but

00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:30,680
usually these meters have I can infrared

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,170
beep like for every cubic meter ok so

00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,840
you can look into that I'll take a look

00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:39,080
at the 1x ratio I have is my casa meter

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,870
is outside so I just like weather

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:45,580
considerations but RF right yeah well

00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:45,580
I'll have a look thanks

00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:59,030
do you have any support for like motion

00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,950
sensors or yeah and so there's the the

00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:03,050
company that makes the switches and

00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,220
sockets they've also got actually loads

00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,450
of people make them and I've got some

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:09,980
from the same company there p ir sensors

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:11,270
i'm not doing a huge amount with them

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,110
yet so that's still kind of work in

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,550
progress but yeah I mean so I am I the

00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:19,520
one thing I've guys in the hallway I'm

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,020
turning on the light when it's dark and

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,370
it so if you like going to the loo

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,470
nighttime the lights turn on three

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:25,910
that's why let's say that's my my

00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:34,340
girlfriend's my favorite feature i think

00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:36,410
we're Thank You anyone else oh well

00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:44,540
thank you to all that's being

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:48,920
interestingly other one hi Alice

00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:53,380
Normandy question if you would have

00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:56,960
choice python 27 which technologies

00:25:53,380 --> 00:26:00,350
would you have choice from for the

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,140
library yeah so if I done in 27 i would

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:06,020
probably one twisted on simply because

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:09,170
they have got cereal support included in

00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,760
the twisted standard library i don't

00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:14,630
know what they call it and so that

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,100
would've been a lot easier I I ended up

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,510
having to kind of figure out a bunch of

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:21,380
stuff there which I I wasn't too

00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:32,240
familiar with so yeah twisty would've

00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:35,210
been a good choice i mean we certainly

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,430
provide some interest i expect all the

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,710
you paisa nieces will have their houses

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,630
automated next year yep if anyone else

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:42,740
wants to try micro dallas and i say so

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:46,220
and get help so i'll be happy to help

00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,390
