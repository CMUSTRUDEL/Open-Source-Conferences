[EuroPython 2014]
[22 July 2014]

Using Python in bringing people closer to programming has been popular for a while. But what are the most effective ways to do so?  The OpenTechSchool reports.

-----

Python has been used in educational programmes ever since.  With a bandwidth that large, navigating the landscape of Python tutorials is hard indeed.

This talk will look at successful Python teaching material. From the numerous iterations our material has gone through, we draw conclusions on what's crucial in teaching Python.  It will introduce how the OpenTechSchool is teaching Python and what measures it found most effective in spreading programming in general and Python in particular.  Among these are rapid feedback, supervised learning, localization, and knowing your target audience.

The author is a member of the OpenTechSchool, a free community initiative which offers Python workshop on a number of topics.  Some of the workshops have been running for more than two years now.  He has written the first versions of "Python for beginners," a workshop which has been used in many cities to teach Python to programming novices.

thank you very much thank you very much

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:26,199
for coming um how do you all like Berlin

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:34,030
got great slate stone advanced now

00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:36,100
how do you like within yeah so I've been

00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,770
to a great job last week of the open

00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,510
tech school that's Rama member and the

00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,789
open text called has workshops for

00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,129
teaching absolute beginners to

00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:48,160
programming how to program in python and

00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:49,739
other languages how we do this is we

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,510
gather a bunch of people among them

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,899
coaches who are notable Python

00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:56,860
programmers who know how to program and

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,350
learners who want to learn how to

00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,350
program they have very different

00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:05,680
backgrounds mostly non-technical people

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:08,350
and then we give them material in

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,369
digital form mostly on sir website they

00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:14,680
can browse and two hours of time to to

00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:18,670
browse and work on the material and the

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,799
exercises so that's weaker was on such a

00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,700
backrub and was walking down the streets

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:29,709
afterwards and after the workshop I

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:33,880
reached some kind of yeah funky place in

00:01:29,709 --> 00:01:36,700
Berlin and I saw this and said I was

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,709
like what why would anyone I mean this

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,810
is one style guide we all love and

00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:44,130
adhere to and yeah you can take pictures

00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,130
I can show you afterwards where it is

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:57,279
maybe so somebody apparently was very

00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:01,389
set up about Titan style guides and

00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:03,159
adhering to to some coding style sorry

00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:05,289
take a look at the Python material we

00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:08,649
currently have like the tutorials and

00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:11,590
stuff and if you look at the very

00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:13,870
official python tutorial it starts off

00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,209
with talking about calculations and

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,050
stuff and how do you add two integers to

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:22,209
each other how to do basic algebra it

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,190
stops with some funky stuff about weak

00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:27,850
references and that's pretty advanced

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,410
for tutorial but okay um so I scrolled

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,900
through it

00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,550
what do you guys think where does it

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,510
talk about the immutability of strings

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:40,050
for example just random guesses to the

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:43,560
end to the middle beginning middle a

00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:46,020
humidor no wrong wrong it's at the very

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,960
beginning it's the third chapter

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:50,370
actually I right after talking about how

00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,180
do we add two integers they go about

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,260
talking about text and strings and like

00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,720
how do I do wall strings and escapes and

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,220
how do i repeat literals of strings like

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,170
some arcane features not even

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,420
experienced Python programmers ever use

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,000
and the python tutorial just goes about

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:14,010
and talks about that in in length and

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,050
very detailed it gets even worse at the

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:18,210
beginning of the tutorials I like the

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,580
very first sentence you read in the

00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,490
python tutorial as hey you can start the

00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,040
Python interpreter with dash M to import

00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,900
a module or Dessie to invoke the command

00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,050
line or dash I to do interactive

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,370
sessions so and if I gave that to a

00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,700
beginner and all workshops they would be

00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:39,209
like oh there's what nobody nobody would

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:41,370
understand that um I had a look at stack

00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:44,520
overflow and so there was some guy

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,910
asking hey I'm trying to teach my

00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,700
brother or sister someone how to touch a

00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:52,530
program until want to do is tighten and

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,830
he asked about what is the best example

00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,030
project example thing I can give them

00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:59,459
what do you think what would be where

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:04,830
would you start with for beginner and

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:10,950
you guess is what turtle graphics pretty

00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:14,970
good anybody else databases yeah just

00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:16,650
show that load yeah crickets that's

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,959
pretty good yeah do you know what Stack

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,480
Overflow side with yeah just talks teach

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,490
them fizzbuzz that was like but why

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,980
would you I mean I yeah fizzbuzz is a

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,290
nice interview question but why would

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,360
anyone teach a beginner how to do

00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:32,100
fizzbuzz I mean having hello world or

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,200
fizzbuzz fizz fizz buds on your command

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,410
line is pretty nice but not the best

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,090
thing to learn programming red and the

00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,560
trend continues if you look at the

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,900
Python books which are out there like

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,220
the material universities have for

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,860
example the MIT starts with

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,970
object-oriented programming this is sees

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,560
the MIT sicp one like 600 one cause this

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,270
is a very beginning to programmers and

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,000
they start talking about objects and

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,600
inheritance and stuff so that's pretty

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,039
funky and so what you can observe is

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,100
that the general trend in the pattern

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,690
community is to write references so

00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,660
everybody wants to be a reference like

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,750
everything needs to be correct and very

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,280
very right and very pythonic and stuff

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:19,140
and I understand that some people react

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,990
very badly of this so if you take

00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,210
anything out of the session today it is

00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,130
that references are not tutorials these

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,840
are very two very different and distinct

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:31,650
concepts I would even say they are

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,850
disjoint and do not intermix and these

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,070
are very different and require a

00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,970
different approach so everybody's big

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:41,910
offer me references are not tutorials

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:44,900
very good great you're doing great best

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:44,900
audience I've ever had today

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,720
so I try to come up with some points

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,850
like what would I say is a reference and

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,530
what would I say as a tutorial so in a

00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,570
reference you try to be very correct

00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,340
like every single thing you say should

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,020
be correct it should be nothing where

00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,890
somebody could come and say no this is

00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,780
wrong like this is clearly not true also

00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,810
in the reference you would always try to

00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,370
be complete so I can well understand why

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,890
the python tutorial went about and

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,250
talked about strings in depth because it

00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:18,050
was a reference right it tried to

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:19,430
examine strings and it try to tell you

00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,290
everything it knows about things like

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,090
they are immutable you can slice dice

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,560
them and you can count how long they are

00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:28,970
and all that kind of stuff and also most

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,370
heightened references try to be a

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:33,320
dramatic right so for example if you

00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,360
wanted to introduce loops to a beginner

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,580
then you would not want to introduce

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,200
while loops and with index variables and

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,440
stuff but you would want to use the for

00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,780
loop with a range function right um I

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,970
think this is the wrong approach for

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,650
tutorial so before tutorials you want to

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,750
do a very different diverse you want to

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,730
be comprehensible so that people can

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,230
actually understand what you're talking

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:56,900
about you want to be coherent so that

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,210
there's like a fine thread woven fuzzy

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,040
the whole tutorial and sometimes you

00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,200
want to be adik and that might sound

00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,350
strange right now but I I coming to this

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,060
in a second so let's talk about these

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,190
points and deafened you'll maybe

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,910
understand where as a distinction comes

00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:16,730
from and how it makes sense so I said

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,970
tutorials need to be comprehensible so

00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,530
one one point I always try to make in

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,630
tutorials with that needs to be

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,370
graphical or just to be hands-on you

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,980
need to see something that you feel

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,200
something in the open tech school we use

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,760
turtle for that so somebody suggest a

00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,000
total file for teaching Python already

00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,590
that's a great tool use it you can you

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,770
can I mean most of you know total right

00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:41,270
quick show of hands who knows total

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,480
that's about ninety percent of the rumor

00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:45,980
let's say 1 99 or something ah so total

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,900
is a very nice tool for teaching Python

00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,960
because you can instantly see stuff and

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:53,360
you can get instant feedback which is

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,610
very great now some people come to me

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,200
when I suggest using trottle and they

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,240
say how about this nap I know

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,310
turtle is pretty nice and it's like very

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,440
old and people know how to use it but

00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,960
it's so childish nobody wants to use it

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,310
like this is for little little children

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,920
why would I want to talk this to

00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:14,820
teachers to adults which is always when

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:18,090
I say no it's not it's so experience has

00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:21,480
shown that when we show the the turtle

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:23,520
or total material to two adults they

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,150
react like this ago yeah it's pretty

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,060
childish but let me play with it so they

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,440
spent two hours playing with it and

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,350
instantly forget it it's for children

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,229
it's very funny another thing to be

00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,660
comprehensible is using their language

00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,820
this applies to like any tour not only

00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:45,750
patent tutorials of course um so that

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:47,310
you don't speak about like objects in

00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:49,050
the very beginning but maybe you want to

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,340
use things instead because people can

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,070
understand what the thing is right the

00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,540
fingers maybe a car or a person but but

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,610
an object like this is a very abstract

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,920
concept and try to use their the

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,410
language not they're not your concepts

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,570
of the world another thing is used their

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,890
language so in the open tech school we

00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,570
translate our material and this might

00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,790
come very obvious to most of you but

00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:11,040
very few people actually do it like

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,650
translating tutorials it's still

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,570
something I would say very few people do

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,220
and it's pretty important because you

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:22,020
can do a lot of things wrong with it so

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:25,560
you can the one-time example about

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:29,120
translations I always have is culturally

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,850
so when you talk about let's say buying

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,950
something for you as dollars then it

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,900
might not be obvious what that means to

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,670
to Chinese people or to European people

00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,920
for example so you want to translate

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:43,980
that as well it's not like only one to

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,890
one translations other things you have

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,520
to watch out is for is that using markup

00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,660
in in translation is very hard I can

00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,550
only recommend things for that but

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:56,790
disclaimer I'm involved with that so use

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:59,220
whatever you want I'm the last thing

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,930
about translations I want to say is try

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,480
to have one master set of translations

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,890
we've had translations where we had like

00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,900
a German version at an English version

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,190
and they kind of teacher

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,320
touched and we had two different

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,790
versions and we didn't know okay this

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,590
fixed was applied to the German one but

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,740
was it applied to the Englishman I don't

00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,210
know well so try to have the the English

00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,540
or whatever language you prefer as a

00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,770
mask masters head of translations and

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,840
always apply fixes to that and then

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,230
translate them back into the other

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,240
material so we spoken about how to make

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,310
material comprehensible like the the

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,130
individual units but how do I make it so

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:41,560
that it's a whole different different

00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:45,550
story like a one thing so very much like

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,890
in music you need to have some something

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:50,290
which is the main voice of it right so

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,010
you need some kind of story which you

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,900
grove and through it so that that is not

00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,340
only in the material itself but also in

00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,220
the in the process of making the

00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:02,860
material we've had material where we had

00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,920
a lot of people contributing to it so to

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,490
say a lot of voices and it kind of got

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,610
very noisy so the material diversion to

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,790
very many directions and try to have one

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,740
main voice um who says okay this

00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:21,840
material goes into that direction and

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:25,450
this is out of scope this is in scope

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,400
one thing we program as very rarely

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,220
think about that is when we write hello

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,570
world or when we write any example and

00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,880
programming we very often have a big

00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,410
context of concepts around it which we

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,680
programmers don't think about because we

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,690
know it but other people have to be told

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,370
what to do like which editor to use

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,010
which encoding do i use this is non

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,870
obvious this is also very easy like you

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,430
can tell them use whatever editor but

00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,440
when it comes to other questions like

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,080
 version do i use people tend to

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,290
say you just use free or Python 2 or

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,490
whatever make the decision you are the

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,760
informed person who can make the

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,800
decision not the learner the very

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,260
critical thing I have seen learners

00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,640
struggle with is a distinction between

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:14,590
files and the shell so are when you have

00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,380
the interactive shell it's pretty nice

00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,630
for trying things out but you want to

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,209
have one point in in the teaching

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:23,970
process where you tell them okay

00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:26,939
was nice let's go to files because it's

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,949
much better to maintain and stuff but

00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,389
have that one point in our material in

00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,089
the open tech school we made the error

00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:35,519
that we kind of left it open for the

00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,559
learner to decide where they at which

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,029
point in time they want to switch to the

00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:43,829
two two files and so you never knew it

00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:46,529
just does that run I already know about

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:49,589
fires why does he use them does he use

00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,639
them you never know so pay attention for

00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,059
that it's it's a very critical

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:58,139
distinction which we intuitively make

00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:59,730
but normal people so to say don't the

00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:02,670
last point is probably the most

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,529
confusing and surprising one but I think

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,519
two targets sometimes need to be idiotic

00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:11,129
so when you think about arm I use this

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:13,980
idiom and this style guy and whatever

00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:18,290
and this is the one true white way to do

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:23,040
it forget about it it's all

00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:25,589
I've seen people suggest very true stuff

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,600
in the sense that it is saying for a

00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:29,459
programmer but not for learner for

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,199
example take this suggestion we had one

00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:34,619
material which was about data processing

00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:36,240
and it needed to open and close files to

00:13:34,619 --> 00:13:39,899
read from them and somebody came along

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,600
and said ha well opening using the open

00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,100
function for files is not the best way

00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,079
to handle because you can lead sources

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:49,079
and stuff so let's use the wif construct

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,649
which is a very true objection but it's

00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,889
not helpful in the in the context of

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:57,449
learning how to process data because

00:13:54,889 --> 00:13:59,149
opening files was not the main context

00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:01,110
like is what it was not the main goal

00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:02,790
people wanted to learn all about data

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:07,230
processing on the with construct this

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:10,740
was not the not the objective my

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,589
favorite exercise I always do with

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,769
beginners is this one I give them the

00:14:13,589 --> 00:14:18,809
exercise draw a rectangle and they will

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:21,540
happily oblige by writing code like this

00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:23,279
so edit or remove the total forward you

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:25,740
move it to divide into that four times

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,959
and then you have a rectangle and then I

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,569
tell them ok that was great now draw

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,999
three rectangles so they will go and

00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,790
copy and paste that code so they now

00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:37,390
have direct

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,810
notes which is very good and then I come

00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm being very mean here and told them

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,010
okay now resize the rectangles make them

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,500
twice as large or twice as small that

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,840
they are so the learners have been copy

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,660
paste this code need to go in and adjust

00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:56,230
every single orange integer you see over

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:58,870
there that's about 4 8 12 integers if

00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,170
I'm correct which was very painful and

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,600
not a nice experience for a beginner

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:06,280
which is the best moment you have in the

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,350
teaching process to introduce the first

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:10,690
statement because you can tell them yeah

00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:12,460
you would not have that pain if you use

00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:16,240
the for statement it's pretty great use

00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:19,690
it I always call that the no pain no

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,910
gain strategy to teaching because if you

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,490
try to let them go through that little

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,700
pain you can adequately teach them how

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,350
to how to use the abstractions and and

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:36,490
to value the abstractions you're

00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:39,160
actually trying to convey I hope I got

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,140
across the point that tutorials are not

00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,330
references to you and that you need to

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,340
be comprehensible coherent and sometimes

00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:47,500
a little bit idiotic when trying to

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,850
teach people Titan or any programming

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:54,600
language thank you for attending and I'm

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,600
open for cushions

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:15,170
okay thank you so far there's one

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:24,620
microphone over there oh wow he was the

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:29,149
first and then at which point do you

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:32,420
explain the difference between the

00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:37,370
reference model of Python and the way

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:39,980
she does it for variables um so because

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,390
most of our audience is non-programmers

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,730
we don't have to explain the difference

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:47,660
we can just explain the bear concept of

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:50,180
references right and the the metaphor i

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,399
always used is using sticky labels so

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:55,519
that you put a sticky label on an object

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,380
and then it has that name the point

00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,850
where we do that is pretty early on as a

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:02,269
material when we talk about variables

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,010
and a variable assignment so um that's

00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,079
the projector or something is pretty

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:08,390
early because if you don't have to

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,100
compare it to to see and like this is a

00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,720
memory slot or something then it's

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:14,809
pretty easy to get across because it you

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:21,350
only say it's a sticky note but very

00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:24,439
trusting next yeah yes thank you for

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:28,040
your talk and I was curious about the

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,850
problem I am faced with in general

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:33,860
that's the self learned helplessness

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,980
problem i think in teaching in general

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:41,990
but software development in particular

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:44,570
that there's a lot of fear for oh I

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:47,240
can't do this this is only for the beta

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:50,240
guys the geeks and and I was

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,010
popularizing and what's your opinion

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,530
about this maybe it's a general

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,900
discussion within the teacher

00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:00,640
environment of software and developments

00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:04,130
to overcome that yeah that problem of

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,600
the scariness of people yeah very good

00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:11,690
point um I I'm afraid I don't have a

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:13,960
very good answer for you because people

00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,710
just sign up for our courses and

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,590
apparently those people already

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,120
motivated enough to do that and they

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:24,380
seem to have a non technical background

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:28,280
so i am not sure I know what is the

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:30,740
reason for that but if you so I've had

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,900
people I've talked to people and told

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,300
them just try it just give me this

00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,560
two-hour workshop to try it and then

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,440
most people will come out of the

00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,810
workshop and be motivated enough to do

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,470
it which is also very critical point

00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:47,360
because I've seen people like when

00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,340
people prepare a workshop most people

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,680
are like I need to explain them objects

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:56,720
and loops and inheritance and everything

00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,790
don't try to do that if you want to

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,430
motivate them like only explains the

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:03,710
very basic stuff you need to spark some

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:05,690
inspiration in them that's something we

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,320
always do like the beginning Clause does

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:11,600
not go into objects at all I guess

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,900
because we just want to spark motivation

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:20,960
and in the in the audience if that is an

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:22,880
answer to vacation yeah thank you very

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,740
much for the nice talk I think it's a

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,840
super fun to teach Python so I do it

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,520
myself and I have two questions the

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,650
first one is do you have any personal

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:33,410
experience with using using ipython

00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:37,820
notebooks for teaching purposes the

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:40,340
answer is nope okay good because I think

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,810
it's I let me um so some people in the

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,370
open tech school use ipython and

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,290
apparently they are pretty successful

00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,700
with that but I can't say anything

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,700
personally because I've not used it for

00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,020
teaching so sorry and the second one

00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,360
second one is how much time do you

00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:56,660
actually spend on explaining syntax

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,850
because python is very simple like

00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,870
syntactically but I in my experience

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,120
when people have never programmed before

00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:03,830
and depending on what language they

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,920
actually speak it is a very difficult

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,510
thing to explain that now everything

00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,610
really matters you can't just switch

00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,930
things around right in some languages

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,600
the sentence structure is completely

00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:16,520
flexible and in English it's often quite

00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,020
flexible so people think that if I turn

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,150
things around it should still work but

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,130
in Python it's really important that yes

00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:23,549
if you initiate a for loop you need this

00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:25,200
column at the end

00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:27,779
and they need to be records around

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,409
functions these things that's an

00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,570
excellent question arm so we don't

00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:35,610
actually do any syntax explanations to

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:37,769
them like going through all the syntax

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,690
at once or something we just tell them

00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:42,210
you need to write that in order to do

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,889
that so very so let's for example take

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:45,570
the for loop right we show them a very

00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:47,970
simple for loop and then we tell them ok

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:51,720
now do see the rectangle example or

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:54,929
something and my guess would be that

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,639
most people are if afraid enough of

00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,249
computers that they would just write

00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:01,109
what you told them to right in the

00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:03,419
beginning so that they know okay every

00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:04,710
single character was important when they

00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,419
miss a character that will just get a

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,029
syntax error right so that's not too bad

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,799
because then they will either fix it by

00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:13,019
just seeing the syntax error or they

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,090
will asked one of the coaches and we can

00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:16,799
tell them okay listen up this is a

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:24,989
computer he needs to understand you you

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:26,309
need the colon like like everyone said

00:21:24,989 --> 00:21:28,529
thank you for the for the sake of his

00:21:26,309 --> 00:21:30,779
own I had a question but because I

00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,340
organized a couple of a Python tutorials

00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:35,909
and some went really well in someone

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,700
catastrophically bad and the one which

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:41,489
one really bad was because I asked a

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,779
question and I kind of was stuck between

00:21:41,489 --> 00:21:47,159
a very easy answer and a very

00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:49,289
comprehensive answer and the question

00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:51,389
was okay you've introduced you've

00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:57,029
introduced us with this full loops and

00:21:51,389 --> 00:21:59,399
if but what do I want to do software

00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:02,609
chops were designed for because I don't

00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:06,029
need a for loop I want to do HTML what

00:22:02,609 --> 00:22:08,789
so yeah I was basically stuck with

00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:11,879
having no answer to this person who was

00:22:08,789 --> 00:22:14,669
attending a software development

00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:18,029
seminary without knowing why she was

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:20,580
doing it so and in these kind of events

00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:24,690
you basically some some have to convince

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,210
people that you have to explain to them

00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,100
why they need what why they might want

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,960
to learn software designers of such

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,539
development sometimes they don't even

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,509
know why they here and I feel that a lot

00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:39,809
of bacon or tutorials do not even cover

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:42,059
the like why would you even do Python or

00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:43,979
software development and so I don't know

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:47,849
if you have an idea about that or yeah

00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:50,759
that's a good point um the the one

00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:53,179
reason i would say people don't asset in

00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,399
our workshops is total total is the

00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:58,079
single best teaching to whatever because

00:22:56,399 --> 00:23:01,409
they instantly see what they are doing

00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:04,649
and they are intrigued enough to buy

00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:07,440
that kind of graphic graphical feedback

00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:09,449
that they will stick to it so total

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,869
seems to be very powerful in getting

00:23:09,449 --> 00:23:16,649
people to actually wanting to do that

00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:24,059
stuff so maybe you just try total and

00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:25,829
see if that gives them exactly so he's

00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,599
just just for the recording he said that

00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:30,179
immediate feedback is important and yes

00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,489
immediate feedback is the one single

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:37,379
best thing I would say and you can use

00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:39,659
in teaching yeah so talking about error

00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:41,549
messages and reading arrows when you

00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,129
have a syntax error what I see from a

00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:46,229
lot of users they don't know your new

00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:48,989
users how to read an error message and

00:23:46,229 --> 00:23:51,089
you talked about translating it's not

00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:53,699
just added this in English but they are

00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:55,679
word in there these are all message that

00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:58,369
they don't understand like attribute

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,709
method function whatever so how do you

00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:04,279
approach this problem the simple answer

00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:06,929
is just ask them so very often I see

00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:09,899
there is the interpreter explode in

00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:13,499
front of people's faces and they're like

00:24:09,899 --> 00:24:15,929
a while crap this didn't work I'm other

00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:18,179
here and then I just go to them and ask

00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:20,459
them hey do you have any clue what just

00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:22,199
happened what does it say and then

00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,729
people will start actually reading the

00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:26,459
error message if you ask them what just

00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:30,059
happened and that usually helps to get

00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:32,190
them trying to understand what the other

00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,289
means and if you then ask them to

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,619
explain to you what just happened when

00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:43,199
they will kind of dig into it and try to

00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:45,860
understand the easier was at hand do you

00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:48,090
take people past turtle

00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,620
so it's like turtle is a great teaching

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,650
tool that teaches the syntax of the

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,200
language and it's fun but at some point

00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:57,510
somebody's going to want to apply that

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,400
to a real world problem and and I

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,610
wondered how you bridge that barrier

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,750
between kind of drawing pictures and

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,299
searching file systems and I kind of

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,559
thing so I think did I understand the

00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,809
question correctly that you are talking

00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:14,910
about real-world problems and okay

00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:17,340
moving from test yeah um yeah sure sure

00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:19,320
so the question was how do you move from

00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:23,970
turtle to to real world problems and

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:26,280
that's indeed a hard topic what we so I

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,320
spoke about motivation right so what we

00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:32,700
use total for is mainly the motivational

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:38,040
part um so to get people to like this

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:39,840
programming thing and what and you are

00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:43,260
right that turtle is very limited in

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,929
what it can do in a real world use case

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,850
we sometimes use like very simple

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:50,820
drawing problems like you want to draw

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:55,100
some nice that's called animation or it

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:57,390
like very contrived geometrical figures

00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,370
but this is where turtle stops here

00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:02,040
right so total is useful in getting

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:03,990
people understand the concepts it's I

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,450
would say not too useful and getting

00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:10,530
them to work on a project that's very

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:12,450
true yeah thank you okay one more

00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:14,580
question because we have to switch rooms

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:20,910
and stuff and you can meet the speaker I

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:24,210
guess yeah sure only hi sometimes I have

00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:26,790
to teach people of course the

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:31,919
programming and or stuff close to that

00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:33,870
and there is one guy who's has the small

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,700
of thinking that he's learning that way

00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:40,679
this is sees a solution and he tries to

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,110
repeat it but of course in this

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,570
particular case abstract thinking is

00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:50,460
really important so this kind of

00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:52,950
behavior is not successful but it's it's

00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:56,159
really hard for him to overcome this

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:57,870
model of thinking have you ever met such

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,120
a such a person and if you

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:04,890
did how did you help him to overcome

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:07,080
this very very settled model of just

00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:10,800
repeating solution instead of finding

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,050
analogies and thinking abstract so the

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,940
question was how do you help people who

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,790
have a very different model of thinking

00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,790
to adopt a new one and so there's one

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:22,830
story I once met a guy who was a parent

00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:24,960
whose brain worked like functional

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:30,660
programming which was pretty amazing to

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,100
me but what well and I I don't think

00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:35,610
there's a good solution to do that that

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:38,910
just let them do enough exercises which

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:43,230
are well suited to the model of thinking

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:45,750
you want them to adopt and that usually

00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,140
helps like using exercises gets people

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:51,570
into into the right mood for for

00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:54,090
critical thinking that's so hands-on is

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,510
pretty important okay thank you very

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,510
much again

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:03,690
