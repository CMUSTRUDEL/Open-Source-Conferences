Description: 
	The naïve programmer
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Kilsyth]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Daniele Procida

Since Picasso encountered Henri Rousseau over a century ago, modern art has been acutely aware of the value of the contributions that the naïve artist can make. Art negotiates the relationship between sophistication and naïvety with care and intelligence.

What does our programming culture make of the naïve programmer?  What can programming gain or learn from this encounter? 

The naïve programmer is simply an unsophisticated programmer. Nobody is born sophisticated. Even the most sophisticated programmers were once naïve programmers. What's more, the adoption of programming simply as a tool to solve immediate problems, by ever more people without any formal training, means that the number of naïve programmers will become greater, not less. Are we ready for this?

This talk will explore the relationship, illuminating it with examples from the world of painting, art and music, and will offer some lessons that our own industry and culture should be ready to learn from.

(This talk will already have been presented as a keynote at DjangoCon Europe 2018)

[Applause]

00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:07,830
Thank You Noah sorry the lights are a

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,559
bit bright here so it's a bit hard for

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:13,889
me to see you anywhere I think they

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,440
probably have to be like that um well it

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:17,910
will get started thanks for coming thank

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,260
you very much to the organizers for

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,699
inviting me for doing all the work to

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,560
put on this conference I know how much

00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,990
work is involved in something like this

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,640
so when you see them say thank you to

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,810
them wearing the yellow shirts like Noah

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:41,010
so they're all volunteers I'll tell you

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:43,680
about me um this is me I look like have

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,379
you no arguments I work for a company

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,320
called DV or a Swiss company we have a

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,420
Django cloud hosting platform would love

00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,219
to talk to you about that if you hosting

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,050
Python or Django on the web come and

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:58,020
talk to me it's based on docker we

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:01,590
basically we do your DevOps for you I'm

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:04,290
a member of the Django core team I'm

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,390
vice president of the Django software

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,490
foundation and I always tell people is

00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,020
not nearly as glamorous as it sounds

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,360
although I hope it sounds at least a bit

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,159
glamorous and the other thing that I'm

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,220
really involved in that matters a great

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,259
deal to me is Python in Africa so it's

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:21,049
one of the things I had the greatest

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,170
privileges to be involved with with

00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:24,750
pythons

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,270
these are my friends from Namibia where

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,299
I go every year for their PyCon and I've

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,049
been involved sometimes more or less

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,270
directly in other pythons in Africa I'll

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,619
be going to the first Python Ghana in a

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,170
couple of weeks time so I'm very excited

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,320
about that and we have plans for a hike

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,060
on Africa so there are a lot of amazing

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,750
things happening thanks to the global

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,570
Python community and the enthusiasm of

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,079
African programmers who want to be part

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,490
of it

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,390
oh and I'm one of the organizers of

00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,040
writing the conference director of

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,240
Python UK which is coming up in

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,229
September in Cardiff you can get in

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:09,390
touch with me email or I'm on Twitter

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,230
and then and so on if you if you want if

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,530
you prefer that but will it get start on

00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:17,980
let's get to business um I want to talk

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,360
to you about the naive programmer and

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,250
that's not the bad programmer or the

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,360
incompetent one it's just the

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:28,810
unsophisticated programmer and everybody

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,550
starts being a naive programmer because

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,950
nobody is born sophisticated even the

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:37,250
most sophisticated ones were once naive

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,650
and naive programmer is everywhere there

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,620
might be some in this room in fact I'm

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:46,730
quite sophisticated but as a programmer

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:48,530
it may be less so so there are many of

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,140
them or us I should say so here's one

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,170
here's the naive programmer you see keep

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:55,790
in mind I'm self-taught so that my code

00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:58,310
might be a little bit messy we'll come

00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,250
back to this was that's important now to

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,310
understand what sophistication means in

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,230
programming we have to understand

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,000
programming as a craft programming is an

00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:10,880
art craft a skill I use those words

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,130
interchangeably so don't be upset if I

00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,639
call programming an art I just mean that

00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,620
it is a practical skill just like maybe

00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,100
shoe making is an art or a craft or

00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:24,319
skill and everybody who engages in any

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,660
craft wants to be better at it of course

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:28,609
they do and even the best programmers

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,519
want to be better programmers they want

00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:34,190
to be better crafts people now there are

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,590
different kinds of crafts in some crafts

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,109
some crafts are aesthetic crafts and

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,510
they're measured against human judgment

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,530
so you have human what kind of human

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:48,170
critics and they quite nice these

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,760
aesthetic crafts because if your critics

00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,540
don't like it they might be wrong and

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,010
you might be right

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,690
you know maybe they just haven't caught

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,120
up with you yet so you might be at the

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,220
other one guard you can engage with your

00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:03,769
critics and argue with them but in other

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,750
crafts in in practical crafts you're the

00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:07,639
exercise your of your craft is measured

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,720
not against human judgments but against

00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:13,720
the world and if you get it wrong you

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,940
can't argue back so easily

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,260
yeah it's not a critic that says whether

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,810
your bridge was any good you know if

00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,460
your bridge falls down then you can

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,669
argue it as much as you like and you

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,940
know programming into it it's this kind

00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:31,099
of craft the Python interpreter is a

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,690
very implacable critic and you've tried

00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:36,080
everything you know even try pleading or

00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:37,130
threatening or tears but it doesn't care

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,570
if you if you've got an error in your

00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:43,039
code it won't run so this is just to

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,780
help understand what kind of craft were

00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:46,789
involved in now here's another

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,830
difference between so there was one

00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,960
difference between crafts here's another

00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,590
one okay some crafts or arts are

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,450
repeatable

00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,099
so flying an aeroplane you're supposed

00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:57,620
to land the aircraft in the same way

00:04:55,099 --> 00:05:01,159
every time you're supposed to remove the

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,710
appendix in the same way every time if

00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:05,030
you're a surgeon you know you don't

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,169
invent new ways of doing it on the spur

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,050
of the moment because you feel like it

00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:10,430
so this is a checklist for landing an

00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,830
aircraft if the pilot will follow that

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,599
every single time but some arts are

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:16,729
creative and programming is one of them

00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:18,289
like painting or music or photography

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,330
where you start with this terrifying

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:21,680
blank page and then have to come up with

00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,930
something new that's never been come up

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,310
with before and that's one of the great

00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,289
things about programming it's it's a

00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,599
creative craft we're bringing something

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:31,130
out of nothing and you know you go to

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:32,900
the theater you go to it you're going

00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:37,490
you go to the theater see a brand-new

00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:40,490
improvised performance on the leading

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,229
edge of dance great that's it really

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:43,550
exciting you're going to the operating

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,880
theatre and find out that somebody's

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,840
going to do an improvisation it's less

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,000
it's less reassuring

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,550
so that helps you understand the

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,479
different kind of crafts that we you

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,950
know you don't know that your

00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,060
anaesthetist is going to be going into

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:58,280
uncharted territory

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,039
but anyway programming is a creative

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,330
craft and that means that even though

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,979
programmers are not painters or

00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:08,450
photographers or musicians in one

00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,330
important respect they're doing exactly

00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:14,479
the same thing which is practicing a

00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,450
creative skill and each of these figures

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:19,310
represents a story about artistic

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,610
naivety which I'll come on to so we'll

00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:25,159
talk about them soon now artists want to

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:27,830
be better at what they do as I said but

00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:30,890
this is literally one dimensional worse

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,380
to better and that's not a very good way

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,039
of thinking about things so all kinds of

00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,219
things matter

00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:40,659
in our you know we judge technique

00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:43,729
creativity judgment sophistication and

00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:47,240
to be a complete artist to be a complete

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:50,990
crafts person you can't lack any of

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,300
those so if you lack technique then

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,330
you're inept if you lack creativity your

00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,569
work is dull if you lack judgment your

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:04,009
uncritical and the artist who lacks

00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:05,689
sophistication is naive and to be

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,539
sophisticated in your craft is to be

00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:09,949
educated and honest a to be formally

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:12,289
educated in it but have been brought

00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:15,800
along by the culture of it to understand

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:18,169
its traditions to be able to measure up

00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,990
to its traditions and standards and to

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:24,110
be able to engage with them and you

00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:26,180
can't become it's impossible by

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,709
definition to become sophisticated on

00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,069
your own you can only become

00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:32,719
sophisticated as part of a culture

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:37,580
through a culture through participation

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:39,499
in it so the sophisticated artist is in

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,659
dialogue with their own art with the

00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:43,430
practices of their and theories of their

00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:46,059
peers and with the history and

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:53,930
traditions of their art so let's meet a

00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:55,219
sophisticated French well he was it was

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,509
all kinds of things he was a painter a

00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:01,819
sculptor ecologist he exemplifies every

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,259
kind of artistic sophistication you can

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,949
imagine he's the epitome of artistic

00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:09,019
sophistication as a young man or as

00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:12,019
young even younger Matt actually had a

00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:14,180
very obvious talent but then in the

00:08:12,019 --> 00:08:16,189
twenties interred the fovea see

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,180
encountered Paul Cezanne and those

00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:23,240
encounters turned him into a

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:25,669
world-changing painter so he he took off

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,439
from seasons innovations in form and

00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:30,289
structure and so on and then together

00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,919
with Picasso Georges Braque invented

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:36,440
cubism which is probably the single most

00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:39,860
significant movement or innovation in

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:42,260
art in the 20th century and cubism is

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,880
not just a style of painting or a new

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,130
way of painting it represents a

00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,140
theoretical and intellectual struggle

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,240
with question

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,890
about reality and representation and

00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,250
it's an engagement that reaches into

00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:56,020
back in time to tussle with the history

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,270
of painting across the arts to engage

00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,860
with developments that were happening at

00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,050
the same time in fictional poetry and

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:05,340
music or across cultures to engage with

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:08,020
African or Asian art and it draws in

00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,400
understandings gleaned from scientific

00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,860
and mathematical discoveries or

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,020
political currents or technological

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,510
developments and philosophical arguments

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:19,260
so it's not just about paint on a canvas

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:23,650
it's a whole way of looking at the world

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,680
so Brock was an artist who had all those

00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:29,380
qualities in abundance creativity

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,000
technique judgment and sophistication he

00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,430
was able to pull everything together in

00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,260
in layer upon layer of intelligence and

00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:37,360
meaning and then speak back to the world

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,030
and speak back to his art about them and

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,060
he brought something so compelling to

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:45,430
this dialogue of his art that it was

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,190
never the same again in fact he changed

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,560
not just art but helped change the world

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,180
he's one of the pillars of the 20th

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,650
century so he's an example of

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,440
sophistication at the highest possible

00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,280
level of you know matchless artistic

00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,890
invention and this complete command of

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:07,300
his craft is why we call him a complete

00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:09,280
artist now maybe it's a bit unfair to

00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,300
start introducing giants like Brack so

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:12,190
early in the morning because I'm not

00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:18,340
expecting everybody to measure up to

00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:20,770
Georges Braque but in one respect to be

00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,870
a complete crafts person if you're

00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:26,110
programmer you need something that Brack

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:28,170
had which is the ability to address your

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:30,940
art to address your craft with

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,430
sophistication so programming's not

00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:35,140
painting but sophistication applies to

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:36,910
programming too and it's an essential

00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,530
dimension of the mastery of the craft

00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:41,560
and there are programmers who are

00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,570
sophisticated and have this mastery and

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,050
face of the face of any challenge they

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,070
can draw upon wide resources not just

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,950
draw upon their own intellectual

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:53,380
resources but from every direction they

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,180
can bring things in to apply to the

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:56,650
problems they face they see parallels

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,750
and connections and relationships that

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:00,550
other people might not even have access

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,310
to or they work with

00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:07,630
and ideas and vocabularies that other

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:10,120
people can't get hold of so they draw

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:12,070
from a deeper well because of their

00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,680
sophistication and that's the programmer

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,110
that we want to be we don't just want to

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,970
be technically good or creative or have

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:21,310
good critical judgment we won't have

00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:26,890
this kind of educated sophisticated

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:29,350
intellectual power too so if the

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,450
sophisticated artist helps us understand

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,310
the sophisticated programmer then I

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,490
think the naive artist will help us

00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,710
understand the naive programmer so I

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,800
showed this picture earlier this is

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:43,920
Rousseau the French painter sitting in

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,060
front of one of his absolutely ludicrous

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,670
paintings and he was the quintessential

00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:51,100
naive artist I think the term naive

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,900
artist was invented for us so he had no

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,430
education in art you know if he was

00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,440
influenced by anything it was by

00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:58,650
inverter Smith's they thought looked

00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,940
nice or pictures and children's books

00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:05,740
we're not talking about somebody on

00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:07,240
George Brock's level here so I mean this

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,710
is there's many things wrong with this

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:12,070
picture and I think top of the list is

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:14,140
that is absolutely hideous his work was

00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:16,030
hoarse and buffoonish and he painted it

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,520
in this flat primitive style with a

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:23,050
child's grasp of perspective and even

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:24,520
the subject matter was childlike or even

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,530
childish and that was anyway you could

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,810
paint if you you know if you've had a

00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:30,610
decent art teacher out of high school

00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:33,220
your art teacher was probably

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,740
considerably more sophisticated than

00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:39,540
poor old only Rousseau so he was a

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,600
painter of let's say immense deficits I

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,400
mean that other picture was horrible but

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,800
at least all these pictures are actually

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,260
really charming even if they're not very

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,570
sophisticated or they have their other

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,670
deficits too but as an artist he was

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,710
completely oblivious to what it means to

00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,740
be an or artists and critics felt that

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:01,930
his work was so empty of thought or

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,090
intentional direction they couldn't say

00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,830
very much about it and there was nothing

00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:07,270
to interrogate or understand or

00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,880
interpret in his work and he was

00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:12,030
completely clueless so according to the

00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:13,710
legend at least he was asked

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,240
which of the artists in the Louvre he

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,980
preferred he said there are too many how

00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,430
can you remember their names so he had

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:24,270
no framework for understanding his own

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:25,590
his own discipline and he's been at this

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,030
to me who's been being accused of having

00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:32,400
an intention deficit disorder that he he

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:33,900
just put paint on the canvas and in a

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
completely shallow way there was nothing

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:38,640
beyond the layer of paint no nothing

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:42,570
deeper in there so yeah kind of a

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,310
hobbyist bungler of a painter but he was

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:45,990
absolutely desperate for recognition he

00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,700
wanted to be part of the art world he

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,260
wanted to be on the inside he loved

00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,000
those painters he loved their works and

00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,280
he wanted to be one of them and

00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,370
considered one of them but he was at the

00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,350
same time oblivious to his own deficits

00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,400
he thought he was a painter of great

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,980
importance and he exhibited relentlessly

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,630
and he and people would literally queue

00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,520
up I'm not metaphorically they would

00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:10,940
literally queue up to laugh at his

00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,880
paintings when they were exhibited and

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:18,330
he he paints as if with his feet and a

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,780
blindfold over his eyes so that's the

00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,490
naive artist and his life programmer

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:25,380
this is like being in a house built by a

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:27,690
child using nothing but a hatchet and a

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:32,150
picture of a house oh by the way this is

00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:36,180
a comic strip from xkcd I'm sure it's

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,920
often quite insightful and this is the

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,700
amateurish bunker at work in front of

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,890
the computer

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,730
the naive programmer is as ripe for a

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:47,040
good laugh as the naive artist limited

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,290
and unaware of the limitations at the

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,540
same time not probably you know style

00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,980
guide the problem here is not style the

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,860
problem isn't the code is a bit messy

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,140
even the reviewer here has not picked up

00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,780
on the problem the problem is that this

00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,690
programmer has limited intellectual

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,460
resources because of a lack of

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:08,970
sophistication to apply to the problem

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:12,660
of programming and the naive programmers

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:14,910
thinking is shallow and narrow and

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,510
impoverished and it comes out in their

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,930
work so the naive programmer is weaker

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:24,030
and less effective and less complete as

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,000
a crass person who will always be

00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:27,460
limited and

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,620
not a thing to be proud of nobody wants

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:38,800
to be that kind of artist or crafts

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:40,750
person but this photograph of only

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,700
Rousseau sitting in front of one of his

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,060
observed paintings was taken by none

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:49,060
other than Pablo Picasso and Picasso was

00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:52,060
absolutely fascinated by Rousseau

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:57,310
because because of course like Brock was

00:15:52,060 --> 00:16:01,450
one of the Giants of art but who so had

00:15:57,310 --> 00:16:05,650
something that Picasso wanted and didn't

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:07,870
have so Picasso saw in Russo's naivety

00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:10,780
not just a lack a deficit something

00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:12,880
negative but something positive a new

00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,160
way of seeing and representing what is

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,440
seen so Rousseau of course a lacked

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,720
sophistication but he did have other

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,780
things he had a powerful artistic vision

00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,660
and he burned obsessively with it he

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:29,680
developed in spite of this lack of

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:32,020
sophistication a language a style of

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,150
painting all of his own and he may have

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,760
been confined and limited to his style

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,560
but it was his style his invention he

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,470
was genuinely and actually quite

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,180
powerfully creative he may have been

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,100
oblivious to the problems in art that

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,960
other artists were trying to solve he

00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,360
may have been unable to articulate his

00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,950
problems in any useful way but I think

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,350
it's fair to say that you know we can

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,120
identify a kind of private problem field

00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,089
that he was struggling with like all

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,310
artists or all craftspeople must do so

00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:02,770
he's not naive he's unable to connect

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:05,140
with the with the dialog or the history

00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:07,630
of art but artists of greater

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,270
sophistication such as Picasso were able

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,699
to see something in Rousseau and make

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,439
those connections on his behalf so

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,290
without ever developing in

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:20,199
sophistication Rousseau came up with

00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:21,790
something new out of nowhere and in fact

00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:22,720
did become a painter of major

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,910
significance

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,589
he was an influence on Picasso and on

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,050
the Cubist's and on the Surrealists on

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:31,570
the German Expressionists on people like

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,690
Kandinsky and he became of an important

00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:37,410
figure for modernism more widely and so

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:42,810
now we've got two more

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:44,120
for dealing with naivety in crafts -

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:47,130
models for the encounter between

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,830
sophistication and naivety we have them

00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:51,720
story of only Rousseau in which even the

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:57,750
most naive things can be understood and

00:17:51,720 --> 00:18:01,290
learned from and added to to the to the

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:04,890
discipline and then we have this one

00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:06,690
which is ours and I want to know what

00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,460
happens next in this story because you

00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,140
know the fact is how in that night

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,250
however however naive this program

00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,750
programmer has built a house maybe

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:17,340
there's something new in that building

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,740
maybe there's something valuable amidst

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,330
the eccentricity and the bungling what

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,240
did they discover all along the way

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,910
doing things in their new way so despite

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,670
the lack of education or sophistication

00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:31,020
the naive programmer was able to create

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,060
something that was worth reviewing in

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,520
the first place maybe that's evidence of

00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,080
creativity or vision or just plain

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,670
perseverance and all this all of those

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:41,610
things are of value maybe there's a

00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:43,380
natural talent there and it compiled

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,660
without errors it's not asking for help

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,030
to make his code rotten he's asking for

00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,430
help to make it better he's trying to

00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,860
open a dialogue so I think that this

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:55,610
naive programmer deserved much better

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,080
than that sophisticated dismissive

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,260
reviewer who will never see past the

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,680
lack of sophistication to what actually

00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,380
is of value and Rousseau was is one of

00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:09,090
many artists of complete naivety who has

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,340
made a serious contribution to art

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:16,110
because there were people able to see

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:18,570
past that lack of sophistication art is

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,180
alive and sensitive to what the naive

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,840
has to offer now what about in

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,610
programming

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,620
what about May Eve programmers if there

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:29,130
are naive programmers with vision and

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,040
creativity and invention maybe the world

00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:33,600
of programming should be aware and alert

00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:38,130
to them in the same way the world of

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,900
artists okay here's another naive artist

00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,230
this is mike disfarmer he was a

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,420
small-town photographer in a rural heavy

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,610
springs in Arkansas and he had a

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,060
portrait studio in this town of one and

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,920
a half

00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,790
people and he made what were called

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:55,740
penny portraits I think actually three

00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:59,790
for fifty cents in it's completely basic

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:01,290
studio and he was so naive he didn't

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:03,960
even know he was an artist in fact

00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:06,540
nobody knew he was an artist until some

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,160
decades after he died when thousands of

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,650
his negatives were discovered in a house

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,990
that was being sold and he became one of

00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:17,220
the photographic sensations or the 1970s

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,260
after he died and all he did was take

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,300
photographs studio photographs of local

00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,980
people in his basic primitive studio he

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,160
wasn't even up-to-date with photographic

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:28,500
developments so he used them he made

00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,330
contact prints from blast plate

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,220
negatives for about thirty years after

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,450
everyone else had started using film

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,470
that would be like meeting someone

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:39,420
saying well here my punch cards so

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,910
completely out of date and out of touch

00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,130
with things but the work is utterly

00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,350
remarkable these unassuming portraits of

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,780
ordinary and often quite careworn

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,490
people and he was just doing his job he

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:52,530
didn't wasn't creating art and these

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,210
pictures are intimate and they're moving

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:59,130
in their startling and they're composed

00:20:54,210 --> 00:21:00,960
with immense skill and care he was a

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,700
master of lighting and his only source

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:10,050
of light was a single North facing

00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:11,550
skylight in his studio I think they're

00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:14,520
immensely sad and moving these

00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,600
photographs and their stories her you

00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,670
know this is during the war her

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,020
husband's in the Navy hence the the Navy

00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:23,940
camp and there are thousand miles away a

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,300
thousand worlds away from the usual

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,760
small town portrait studio output there

00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:32,750
are no cliches there's no retouching he

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,070
doesn't use any standard forms or poses

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,560
probably because he was so naive he

00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:40,560
hadn't even learned those cliched forms

00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:42,930
so as Anna you know it's like a song of

00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:48,000
beauty and sadness and he only had one

00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:50,340
song but such a beautiful world and the

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,170
only resources that he had were his own

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,120
he had nothing else to draw upon even

00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:56,400
Rousseau was aware of a world of art it

00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,760
seems that mike disfarmer wasn't even

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,679
aware of the rest of photography he

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,299
hadn't he wasn't

00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:04,309
out of any artistic culture he had no

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:06,320
pretensions to it and unlike Rousseau

00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:08,090
and these pictures these extraordinary

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,809
pictures come from nothing else but his

00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:14,509
astounding eye for photographing people

00:22:11,809 --> 00:22:16,070
and you don't I can assure you do not

00:22:14,509 --> 00:22:18,499
make pictures like this unless you know

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:21,409
exactly what you're doing so they're

00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:23,990
pictures of elegance and power it's so

00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:25,669
in their form they hold the eye because

00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:27,289
of the balance and tension in them and

00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:32,419
in their content that you know they

00:22:27,289 --> 00:22:33,619
speak directly to the human heart and as

00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:35,929
I say this was His only Son

00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:38,690
it was the only thing he knew how to do

00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,639
he didn't have versatility or range he

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,249
wasn't aware of the rest of the world of

00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:44,929
his the world of his artistic discipline

00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:47,539
he lived in his own middle world

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:52,220
just doing his job making pictures for

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:54,980
his customers and maybe there are mike

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,179
disfarmer 'he's in programming working

00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:59,720
away on their own

00:22:56,179 --> 00:23:01,600
unknown unnoticed disconnected from

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,429
everyone else producing little

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:10,730
masterpieces as part of their everyday

00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:12,200
work now not every programmer is or

00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,460
should be a software professional some

00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,990
are just completely normal people who

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,330
have started programming for for some

00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:19,759
reason and think about the offices the

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,769
workplaces the factories and

00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:25,100
laboratories where somebody might have

00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:27,830
written a computer program to make some

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,240
part of their work better or easier they

00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,409
allowed themselves to imagine they could

00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,909
solve a problem with the computer

00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,610
program and we meet people like these

00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:36,529
they don't tend to come to pie cons and

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,490
Europe pythons and so on because they

00:23:36,529 --> 00:23:39,320
don't know about us

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,639
they've just been working in their own

00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,070
little world but occasionally we meet

00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:45,139
them they've done some things in a very

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:46,249
peculiar way because they didn't know

00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:47,840
any better or didn't know otherwise

00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:49,700
nobody was around to show them anything

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,169
different and they haven't heard of

00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:53,059
things like version control or

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,249
separation of concerns and they don't do

00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:57,669
testing and you'll find them doing

00:23:55,249 --> 00:24:00,139
things like writing their code in

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,519
Windows notepad because they didn't know

00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:03,799
there was anything any other way to do

00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,049
it or using an online Python environment

00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:09,909
because they getting Python to run on

00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:12,620
their windows 98 was just too difficult

00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:14,360
but software development is

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:15,800
fashion and of course we have to have

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,440
standards for that profession just like

00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,930
all professions because it has to be a

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,370
bit exclusive it has to put up barriers

00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,980
to protect the profession and to

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:25,790
guarantee quality we should not if we

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,830
can help it

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:30,559
be using inadequate tools or following

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,510
poor practices so as programmers we pay

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,970
a lot of attention to how people work

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:38,690
and we don't hesitate to make remarks

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:41,710
about how they use their tools but this

00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:44,260
is so important not every programmer

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,280
needs to be measured by the standards of

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:48,380
professional software development and

00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,290
there are more of these naive

00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:53,390
programmers working quietly than you

00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:55,490
think and they don't come to our

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,780
software conferences we don't know how

00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,970
many of them are out there solving their

00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,559
own problems in whatever way happens to

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,480
work for them and we don't know what

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,700
things they might be inventing and what

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,390
things of value they might be coming up

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:11,809
with so what are the implications for

00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:16,040
them of this even if it's not directed

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:17,270
at them personally or even statements

00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,280
like this I mean this is not meant to

00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,050
put anyone down this is Jacob Kaplan

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,300
Moss one of the other Jango

00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:25,040
well the craters of Jango actually code

00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,620
without tests is broken by design now

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,000
Jacob is if you know him he's software

00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:30,980
professional of the most accomplished

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,220
kind and more importantly he's a kind

00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:34,640
and generous person but I think that's

00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:43,910
not true

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:45,679
I was if a Django girl goes into work

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,179
the the week after her first

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,250
introduction to Python and writes a

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,350
problem that solves that writes writes a

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,820
program that solves a problem at work is

00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,760
it broken by design because she did it

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:57,530
without tests or did it in Python 2 or

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,260
didn't use version control or if a

00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,950
graduate student in a science lab

00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:03,380
realizes that she can solve a problem

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:05,960
with some code can we call it broken

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:07,309
because it's deficient in some ways by

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,380
the standards of the professional

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:14,450
software developer so III think that I

00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:17,270
don't think we're entitled to call

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:18,770
things broken because of how they're

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:24,800
done I don't think there are

00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:35,160
circumstances may I declare these things

00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:35,790
broken in such a confident way for most

00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:39,050
people

00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:41,130
programming is just a means to some end

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:42,420
starting with children in primary school

00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:43,920
we're putting programming into their

00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,480
hands asking them to do things we don't

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,370
expect them all these people to become

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,410
professional software developers they

00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,240
will all be trained formally as

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,610
programmers we just want them to be able

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,050
to do a bit of coding as a tool for life

00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,540
and their work to understand how

00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,800
computation works and if we're going to

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,920
put programming into these people's

00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,080
hands we're going to encounter naivety

00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,540
in their work we're going to encounter

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,070
more and more naive programmers because

00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,170
rightly these people will consider

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,080
programming to be only a means to their

00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:16,710
ends and I think we had better get used

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,450
to as a community of programmers to

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,130
having a lot more naive programmers

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:23,100
around us and I think we'd better get

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:27,900
used to making fewer statements about

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:31,260
what we consider to be broken here's my

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,000
final choice for examining artistic

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,660
naivety now when I was a teenager I

00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,950
discovered the records I discovered the

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,630
records of Talking Heads as a teenager

00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:42,540
and it turned out to be really important

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:45,510
for my education and she was there bass

00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:46,830
guitar player they heard the four

00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,380
Talking Heads I chose her purse house

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,180
bit in love with her and they were

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,820
famous they had really long necks so as

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:57,510
you can see the amazing Nick's people

00:27:53,820 --> 00:28:01,950
admire their Nicks immensely ass now

00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:03,840
between 1977 and 1988 they released ten

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:06,060
albums of exceptional creativity and

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,040
quality and as artists they absolutely

00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:10,650
hit the ground running they were already

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,730
quite sophisticated they'd been to art

00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,990
school and they followed their first

00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:15,810
record with three more that they

00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,360
recorded with them Brian Eno and they

00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:21,420
went deeper into complexity their work

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,930
becomes digs deeper reaches further the

00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,660
surface tips you know the development in

00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:30,780
sophistication is really apparent and

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,040
firstly I just liked the sound that they

00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,210
make which is quite reasonable when

00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,810
we're talking about music you know yeah

00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,850
I like

00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:37,830
but later especially through reading

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,920
about them I realized that something

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:43,260
else was going on as I became a more

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,610
sophisticated listener that it was my

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,390
first real understanding as I say as a

00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:50,940
young teenager of sophistication as an

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:52,380
artistic quality and you can play these

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,370
records one after the other and trace

00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:56,550
this development

00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,050
and after the initial immediate response

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,120
to the music which is great there's

00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:03,780
another level to explore that itself

00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,670
yields more as their sophistication as

00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:07,800
artists grow now by the time of their

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,170
fifth studio album they were masters of

00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,760
their craft you know they were important

00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:14,400
enough to be reviewed in the Wall Street

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:17,160
Journal for example and they followed up

00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,590
speaking in tongues their fifth studio

00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,090
record with a tour from which the

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,080
concept films stopped making sense was

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:24,570
made which you may well have seen

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,600
directed by Jonathan Demi now it's

00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:29,910
described often this being one of the

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,820
best concept films ever made which is

00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:34,110
not a genre filled with masterpieces to

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,240
be honest it's of a genre filled with

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:41,910
mostly complete junk but still as a

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,560
piece of film work it is itself of the

00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:45,210
highest quality so here they are with

00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:50,090
their extended expanded nine-piece band

00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:54,240
captured at a moment of total artistic

00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:55,470
triumph I think God probably watches

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,770
this film sometimes just to remind

00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:00,180
himself how good it is and what makes

00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,160
artistic work like this worth returning

00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:04,590
to over and over again

00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,470
is the multiplicity of layers and

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:10,410
dimensions in it the depth it contains

00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:12,720
and it has the same kind of depth of

00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:14,130
artistic and intellectual curiosity that

00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,070
you'll find in an artist like Georges

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,050
Braque and for talking heads an

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,420
important part of their sophistication

00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:23,040
was attention to practice attention to

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,920
how they did what they did

00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,710
and this is something that programmers

00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,330
are very interested in programmers are

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,610
fascinated by the process of programming

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:34,610
sometimes it seems more fascinated by

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:37,370
how they work than what they actually

00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:40,590
produce in this so they are forever

00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:42,210
talking about strategies and

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,980
methodologies and workflows and

00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:47,040
processes so I've had a nice joke about

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,789
this know his craft work inventing

00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,889
electronic

00:30:47,789 --> 00:30:53,369
music standing desks and scrub meetings

00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:55,139
all at the same time yeah so programmers

00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:57,179
are convinced that if they just find the

00:30:55,139 --> 00:30:58,289
right process everything else will will

00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,359
just work Oh

00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:02,450
sophisticated programmers do that but

00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,289
attention to practice the same thing

00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:06,090
it's the same kind of thing in

00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:08,580
programmers and in artists of any level

00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:10,259
of sophistication I mentioned that

00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,539
talking heads with worked with Brian Eno

00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:14,460
so you know collaborated with Peter

00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,440
Schmidt an artist they produced a set of

00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,099
cards called oblique strategies they own

00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:25,080
heard of oblique strategies um they're

00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:26,700
to help artists by suggesting a chain a

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,830
change in thinking or a new course of

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,999
action so you just deal some cards

00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,299
randomly and they'll say things like

00:31:29,999 --> 00:31:34,769
what wouldn't you do abandon normal

00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:38,549
instruments give way to your worst

00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:40,669
impulses so Brian Eno used these cards

00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:42,539
when he was recording with David Bowie's

00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:44,489
three albums that they record it

00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:47,190
together in Berlin now Talking Heads

00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:49,229
recorded three albums with you know but

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:51,179
they didn't use the cards because

00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:53,009
Talking Heads as I said they'd already

00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:56,309
been to art school they were already

00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:58,950
interested and aware of practice they

00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:00,570
had their own strategies too fresh and

00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:05,539
stale habits and unblocked stalled

00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:09,450
creative efforts and they deliberately

00:32:05,539 --> 00:32:11,879
embraced the naive in order to further

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,529
their creative process their favorite

00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:15,629
technique was to swap instruments in the

00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:17,099
studio so they each musician was playing

00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:19,080
something they weren't very good at and

00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:22,320
that they'd often improvise like this

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:26,099
but they make sideways turns they do

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,399
wrong things unexpected things by by by

00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:32,070
swapping instruments it made them less

00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:34,019
sophisticated and more naive so out of

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,869
that niet naivety they brought forth

00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:41,999
something new and the story of Talking

00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:46,349
Heads is one of continual reinvention

00:32:41,999 --> 00:32:49,440
and serious surprising creativity for

00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:52,049
their entire existence and one thing

00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,960
that made them possible made it possible

00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:58,129
for them to sustain that was their

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:00,190
understanding of the power of the naive

00:32:58,129 --> 00:33:02,350
so it's not a coincidence that

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:04,179
you you know we have concepts like

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:06,100
beginner's luck or beginner's mind in

00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:08,200
Japanese show Shin where the beginner

00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:10,840
the naive person approaches something

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,700
and because their mind isn't already

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,860
running on Rails because of the

00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:18,210
education sophistication they come up

00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,470
with something new and unsophisticated

00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,440
so being naive doesn't make you better

00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:25,149
at doing anything doesn't make you more

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,700
sophisticated but being able to draw

00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:30,879
upon the naive might be something

00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,740
valuable so for their speaking in

00:33:30,879 --> 00:33:36,039
tongues record talking heads explode

00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:40,000
this tune of paranoia and menaces

00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:41,559
absolutely seeding and the song the

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,210
record opens with a song burning down

00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:46,570
the house which itself opens with a

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:48,879
warning so it's it's sinister and it's

00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:51,340
dark and the songs seem to be conjuring

00:33:48,879 --> 00:33:53,909
up images of madness and sin and flames

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:57,610
looking at the edge of the world and

00:33:53,909 --> 00:34:00,039
madness on every side so the Panda doing

00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:02,409
exactly what they want they're in

00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,049
complete command of all of these forces

00:34:02,409 --> 00:34:07,269
but the last song on the record is

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:08,800
called this must be the place and it

00:34:07,269 --> 00:34:10,450
takes a fight turn it's the most

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,000
beautiful song on the album and the

00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:14,859
simplest smallest one of them all and

00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,270
it's so simple and unassuming that most

00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:17,649
people kind of missed it when it was

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:19,389
when it first came out it's just got

00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:21,819
three chords all the way through and

00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:24,609
it's got a pathetical subtitle this song

00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:26,470
that's wholly accurate and it's unlike

00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:29,800
almost any Talking Heads song until that

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:32,950
point and the most tender so you've got

00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:35,470
this whole this huge slab of swampy

00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:38,079
sidewinding funk and then you emerge

00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,250
blinking into daylight with this it's

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,290
like spending the night in the company

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,409
of demons and exorcists and then coming

00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:46,210
into a clean fresh morning so the song

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:48,220
the record speaking in tongues starts

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:50,770
with this slightly terrifying song about

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:55,929
burning down a house and then ends with

00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:57,430
a song about being home and it for the

00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,140
band you can see it as a sign postal in

00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:02,829
the next direction of their two albums

00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:05,109
or where this explode naivety even

00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:08,290
further now what's interesting about

00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:10,660
this song is in the 35 years since it

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,730
will came out it has taken on life of

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:14,140
its own it's been rediscovered and

00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,900
there's a film of

00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,589
named after it with by Paolo Sorrentino

00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:22,029
with Sean Penn in it I've not seen this

00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:23,049
the talking head songs it there's more

00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:25,660
of the ones that have been the most

00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:27,489
recorded by other artists I discovered

00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,589
that by charts I didn't know that most

00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:32,650
about people haven't really heard very

00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:36,029
much oh it's not the song I would have

00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:38,710
expected to become one of the most

00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:40,960
recorded off of their songs it's such an

00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,849
unassuming simple song but there's

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,339
something in it that people have been

00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:49,349
able to pull out and I think it probably

00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:53,920
because of its naivety and simplicity

00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:55,509
maybe it allows people more room to make

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,299
their own interpretation maybe it's like

00:35:55,509 --> 00:36:01,239
one of those disfarmer portraits that it

00:35:58,299 --> 00:36:04,390
speaks more directly to people now I

00:36:01,239 --> 00:36:05,819
said earlier that being naive in itself

00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:07,930
is not a thing to be proud of

00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:09,400
sophistication is necessary to be a

00:36:07,930 --> 00:36:10,960
complete programmer or an artist and

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:13,569
it's if you lack it

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,640
that is a deficit but sophistication is

00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:19,210
not the only thing that's required to be

00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,519
a in command of your craft it's not a

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:24,009
substitute for technique or creativity

00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:27,700
or judgment and worse the pursuit of

00:36:24,009 --> 00:36:30,190
sophistication can come at the expense

00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:32,410
of these and history of art is littered

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:34,119
with artists who pursued sophistication

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:36,970
and found they left no room for those

00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:40,450
other things their work becomes tired

00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:42,279
and jaded and stale their sophistication

00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,289
grew so much it became a burden they

00:36:42,279 --> 00:36:46,749
couldn't set aside and I am sure the

00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:49,299
same thing happens to programmers and if

00:36:46,749 --> 00:36:52,119
I had to choose I would rather be a

00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:55,390
naive in expert programmer with a

00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:57,160
creative vision than a sophisticated

00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:59,799
expert who could solve all the standard

00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:03,599
problems but who had seized to invent

00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:03,599
any new problems of their own to explore

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,720
so

00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:17,730
my own code I think was messy and a

00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,069
little bit inelegant and didn't have

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,430
tests and so on perhaps it was some way

00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:26,220
it was like a botched effort by a child

00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:29,369
it was naive but it worked and I built a

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:35,369
house once with my code and it stood and

00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:36,599
it did a job that where I worked that

00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:38,839
solve the problem that other more

00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:41,160
sophisticated programmers had not solved

00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,260
it delivered the institution I worked

00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,329
for something that was badly needed and

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,790
saved many thousands of pounds over

00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:50,010
several years so it was only a means to

00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:52,020
an end but it was a success as a means

00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:53,339
to an end it served the institution it

00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:56,130
served the people who work for it

00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:59,339
however naive however bungling however

00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:01,710
botch them and amateurish it was of real

00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:04,290
value to someone and I can be proud of

00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:08,910
that even if I can't really be proud of

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:11,040
the naivety so all these figures and

00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:12,540
stories represent different models

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,230
between of the relationship between

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,270
naivety and sophistication and of all of

00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:20,790
them I think this is the only one that

00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:23,339
has no value at all however

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:28,410
sophisticated you are I think you need

00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:31,050
to be able to recognize something that

00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:32,810
lies beyond sophistication if your only

00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:35,670
response to naivety is dismissive

00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:37,980
dismissiveness or ridicule what harm

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:40,290
will you do and what will you fail to

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:46,079
learn so without sophistication you're

00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:48,569
incomplete but you don't need to be the

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,260
ultimate sophisticate to be in command

00:38:48,569 --> 00:38:54,230
of your craft as a professional you

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,950
don't need to be a George Brock and

00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:57,720
probably you're not going to be there

00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:00,060
showing back of programming I'm sorry to

00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,010
inform you of that you're not going to

00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:04,349
be a Picasso but you can be like Picasso

00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:06,720
sophisticated program practitioner who's

00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:08,670
able to see past the deficits and

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,800
limitations in the naive just to its

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:13,170
power and its gifts take advantage of

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,450
them you could be like Talking Heads you

00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:17,280
can be sophisticated masters of your art

00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,930
swapping instruments in the studio to

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,470
draw upon the naive as a creative

00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:25,280
resource finding new ways to be in

00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:27,680
main fresh and inventive or maybe you're

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,750
never going to be a sophisticate in that

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,240
case you could be a home reader an

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,520
honoree or so and it would be prouder to

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,680
be a roo so whatever your limitations

00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:39,460
producing work of incandescent invention

00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,570
than to be a tired old sophisticate

00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,300
those people who laughed at him we don't

00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:46,010
remember their names hmm

00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:48,320
so their mockery of him was a bit

00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:51,020
premature and if you're a programmer you

00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,609
have every right to be proud of what you

00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,950
do when you exercise your powers of

00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:56,480
creativity and invention to solve a

00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,640
problem even if there are some old ones

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,760
and even if the itch that you scratches

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,950
are entirely private or you could be a

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,630
dis farmer so naive that you're barely

00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:08,180
aware of the culture and traditions of

00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:12,140
your craft but working quietly producing

00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:14,869
modest creations of beauty as a

00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:16,670
programmer creating work of small that

00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:20,030
real value doing it in whatever way you

00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:22,550
know how however may even limited so

00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:24,290
these are useful ways for us to think

00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,780
about the relationship our relationship

00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:29,240
with our craft and if I said one thing

00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:31,460
that makes one programmer feel better

00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:33,440
about their lack of expertise or makes

00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:35,630
one programmer hesitate before pouring

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,900
scorn on the naive that's worth

00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:41,089
something and in modern art since the

00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:44,210
earlier 20th century the naive has had

00:40:41,089 --> 00:40:46,640
an important and influential place in

00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,470
the world of art the adventures are

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,960
honor of honorary so took place over a

00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,570
century ago and heal a sophistication he

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,089
was incomplete flawed a lesser artist

00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:58,400
but whatever his artistic deficits we

00:40:56,089 --> 00:41:00,619
now judge him much more kindly than the

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,480
ones who poured scorn on him at the time

00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:04,520
because he lacked artistic

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,849
sophistication but they lacked something

00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:13,310
much more important which was artistic

00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:14,900
vision so long if the naive programmer

00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,609
because I can't work wait for

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:20,359
programming to learn the same lesson

00:41:16,609 --> 00:41:21,140
that I learned in the 20th century thank

00:41:20,359 --> 00:41:31,640
you

00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:38,100
[Applause]

00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:42,480
okay we are thank you very much speech

00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:49,680
and also it's a question for you anyone

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:52,740
I have a question hi I'm just wondering

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:54,030
if you could if you had any examples

00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,640
that kind of came off the top of your

00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,980
head of kind of naive approaches to

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,960
programming which have kind of caught on

00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:05,970
and become influential well Django

00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:08,790
itself two of the four creators of

00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:11,610
Django were they one was a journalist

00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:14,610
and one was a student of literature so I

00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:16,890
think in the early days of Django they

00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:19,560
did many things wrong and they rapidly

00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:21,570
became sophisticated they learned very

00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:27,180
fast and they worked with sophisticated

00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:29,910
programmers but partly because of their

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,170
naivety I think they did to imagine oh

00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:36,840
we couldn't solve this problem with some

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:39,750
code and being naive helps you not be

00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,520
put off by what you know the huge task

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,080
that's maybe ahead of you so I think

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:45,770
that could be one example perhaps I'm

00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,770
sure there are others

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,230
okay this is a most blessed question

00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,610
because we have been wrong time yeah

00:42:55,230 --> 00:43:01,830
yeah thank you for the talk I think that

00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:05,640
we're in a in an environment where we

00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:09,180
are pushed to you sometimes pretend that

00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,640
were sophisticated and I think that a

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:15,930
lot of us do you pretend that from more

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:20,610
sophisticated that we that we are what

00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:22,410
would be a recommendation to talk to

00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:25,800
someone who obviously pretends he is

00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:28,500
more sophisticated than and there and

00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:32,340
and tell them no it's okay to be naive

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:34,080
and please stop this I don't know maybe

00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:36,950
you can tell them the story of only

00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:40,650
Rousseau or mike disfarmer because

00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,760
people will see that in other contexts

00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,410
even if they can't see it in their own

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,260
perhaps I'm not quite sure it's a good

00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:49,020
question

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:51,970
okay sorry we are all time so this well

00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:55,910
can't thank you

00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:55,910
