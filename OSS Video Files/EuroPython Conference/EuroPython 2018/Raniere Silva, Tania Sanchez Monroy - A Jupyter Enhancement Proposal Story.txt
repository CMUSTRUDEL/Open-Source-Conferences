Description: 
	A Jupyter Enhancement Proposal Story
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Fintry [PyData]]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Raniere Silva, Tania Sanchez Monroy

Python users should be familiar with the concept of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs), the way that the Python language evolves over time. In a similar fashion, the Jupyter project has Jupyter Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). This talk with cover the proposer first-hand experience when submiting JEP 23 - Add Template as Metatada enhancement proposal from it's beginning, during EuroPython 2017, up to its current status. We will, in addition, present efforts made as part of the OpenDreamKit project to perform Jupyter notebooks conversions using custom metadata, templates, and exporters, in a programmatic way. 

Outline

0:00 - 0:05 Who are we? We are impostors!
0:05 - 0:10 Our previous experience with Jupyter Notebook. We will talk about the time that Software Carpentry used Jupyter Notebook for their lesson creation and OpenDreamKit Jupyter notebook programmatic notebooks conversion.
0:10 - 0:15 You are not alone. We will talk how the idea for the Jupyter Enhancement Proposals (JEPs) borned at EuroPython 2017 Help Desk
0:15 - 0:20 Writing our first Jupyter Enhancement Proposals. We will cover our steps to create the pull request required by the Jupyter Project.
0:20 - 0:25 What is the current status of the Jupyter Enhancement Proposals? We will cover any progress from the time of this talk proposal submission and the date of it presentation.
0:25 - 0:30 Time for questions

thank you so Tanya sent her apologies

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,790
she was double-booked it so she couldn't

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:19,020
come so my name is hinari silver most of

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,630
the time online news are GA ACS as my

00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:25,890
username so if you're looking to find me

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,630
online that's my username and Tanya

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:30,679
that's her contact if you want to find

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,969
her online she's very active on Twitter

00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:40,050
so how does a triplet proposal kind of

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:43,530
start was last year on this same city in

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:49,110
Edinburgh so there is a project from

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,309
Arizona 2020 that's a big grand project

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,579
from the European Union

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:57,719
and one project under that umbrella stay

00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:59,969
open and drink it so the idea for this

00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,149
project is to work on infrastructure for

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,299
researchers and one of the goals is to

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,350
strength really researched and

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,500
environment so for example Jupiters

00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:17,310
notebooks and all the duplicate systems

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,740
and last year as I was saying we had a

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,560
meeting that was the computational

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,210
mathematics we've shipped and at the

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,770
International Centre for my family's

00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:31,409
science so the Institute's suffer

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,509
sustainability Institute where I walk we

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:38,130
have some fellows and one of the fellows

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:42,780
is Alexander canal what I love and his

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,240
one of the PI's co-investigators for the

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,869
open trinket project so he kindly

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:54,770
invited me to join are the teams for

00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:59,399
this one week half talks half Hockey Day

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,469
which was kinda quite nice so during all

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,560
the conversation that people is having

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,479
we're starting talking about how to

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
develop a license because most of people

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,239
there was interesting on that so at some

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,950
point was like we want to have lessons

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,310
in a website that

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,519
looks nice not exactly as nice as this

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,040
one because this is an old one but I got

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,319
involved in software carpentry

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,569
that's a nonprofit organization that

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,230
teach people in academia how to code in

00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:34,110
Python and version control that's their

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,420
software and this is a screen shot for

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,459
how their license was looking like in

00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:44,099
2014 what you can see on the screen is

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:46,349
that they have title for this license so

00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:49,709
it's making choices and they have a

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:52,769
little below a series of objectives for

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:54,810
that lesson so for example readers

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,510
suppose you know how to create a single

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,799
image made out of call of blogs at the

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:04,230
end of that lesson so it's a little not

00:03:01,799 --> 00:03:07,349
too long lesson but you can see some

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,959
codes at the first section so image

00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:13,410
grades you can see some Python codes in

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:15,900
some cells so the idea that was

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,600
discussing on the workshop site will be

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,380
really nice you end up with some lessons

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,900
that has this kind of look look a little

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,630
more professional and with some colors

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,940
that make readers find things easily but

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,880
that you could write the lesson in

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,980
cheapest notebook because if there's

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,780
some code and some output you don't want

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,250
you to copy and paste every time that

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,630
you change especially if you you have

00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:45,799
100 cells on your lesson so we were

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:49,079
looking on Jupiter so this is the same

00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,489
lesson that doesn't have the title but

00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,160
you can see that their objections are

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:57,900
the same and the same Python codes so

00:03:53,160 --> 00:04:01,530
this is Jupiter at that time 2014 we

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,500
didn't use the word Jupiter was ipython

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,930
notebooks at that time so it's the same

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,109
notebook that was generated in that

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,459
previous image but just on Jupiter and

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:16,169
it was like so this is how we'll have on

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,320
Jupiter and this is how we're writing

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:22,849
which most people on academia that used

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:26,550
that tools is already familiar with but

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:28,169
this when you're trying to export is you

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,880
can choose someone that's going to read

00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:32,460
the lies you can say oh I can use any

00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,979
beef veal that's a nice suit I just need

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:39,330
to send that link and this is how you

00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:41,970
going to see on an review which is ok

00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:45,510
but as you see you still have like the

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:48,360
numbers of the cells here which as you

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,940
see certain six on this example and why

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,340
they really can think why start on six

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,700
and not one if they start of the lesson

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,620
and there is no caller so it can be a

00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:01,969
little high for people to follow the

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,919
lesson because it doesn't make very

00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:07,200
highlighting things and it was keeping

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:11,669
these discussions like okay so what you

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:15,000
can do and if you ever use tube the

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:18,240
notebook you might have come across with

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,550
the option to download your notebook in

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,070
different formats so you can download

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,349
this the notebook itself but you can

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,479
also download as a Python script that

00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:30,320
was something that I mentioned yesterday

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:33,060
on the beginners day for someone that

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,039
person was asking like if I want you get

00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,979
just I scraped from the notebook so you

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,690
can just go download you can download as

00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:45,479
eight ml for you or markdown or

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:47,700
restructures tags or latex or get a PDF

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,330
via latex so there's a couple of options

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,700
and it was like okay so let's see how

00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,710
end up if you decide to download as HTML

00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,729
because you can upload the HMH many

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,979
websites and they just render and looks

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,349
exactly as any review because that's

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,169
basically what any of you was doing and

00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:09,030
it's like okay we still have this kind

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:13,050
of same problems you want to remove some

00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:15,630
things and add some things so keep on

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,599
that discussion are not thing that

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,460
people kind of raised was like sometimes

00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:23,280
you have one less and what you want to

00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,110
split the lesson in soup lesson so it

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,610
may be when she's splitting like day one

00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:30,539
and day two because the two days

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,779
workshop or morning or afternoon and you

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:38,250
might have extra contents not just to

00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:39,370
pen notebooks you might have Python

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,260
script because you

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,930
explaining for people how they're going

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:46,450
to use scrapes or you might have some

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:51,760
file formats that want to download

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:53,320
because you have some chemistry files

00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,210
that people need to read and so on and

00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,550
you want to make easy for people to

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,770
download all this files so you aren't

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,190
you organize all the lessons in some

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,440
format so this is screenshot was

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,960
something that Tonya was end up working

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,500
during that week one one year and half

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,710
ago

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,560
here in Edinburgh and it's kind of a

00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:18,490
good nice prototype it's you can

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,400
actually use but still was discussing

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:24,820
how you can use batter-dipped in

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,340
notebooks and the main thing that was

00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:31,270
like why do you want use Duplin

00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:35,380
notebooks it's because the environments

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:39,460
familiar to outers and it's part at this

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,620
moment mod 40 program language so it's

00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,110
not just fight and if someone is writing

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,150
a lesson in ah they can use the same

00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:49,450
infrastructure if someone is writing a

00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:51,910
lesson in C the same thing they just can

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:57,010
build on top of everyone what everyone

00:07:51,910 --> 00:08:00,550
else already contributed and what pieces

00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:03,340
of the pipeline are we kind of build on

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,410
top so there's n bit convert can you

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,080
raise your hand if you know all right

00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:11,289
what and we'll convert axis so let's

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,690
half of the room so when we convert is

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:17,140
what's behind all that options that I

00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:19,000
was showing before on Jupiter notebook

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,880
that you can download the notebook in

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,390
different formats and the other things

00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:29,110
any start site generated like Sphinx who

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:31,409
go check oh so that was the two pieces

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:35,830
of work that you need to build on top

00:08:31,409 --> 00:08:39,039
and Tonya was again working on other

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:41,140
ideas on mixing gypte notebooks and

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,820
Jacko's so that's one of the git

00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:48,810
repositories and

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,770
fast-forwarding a little bit this is the

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:54,170
Travis

00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:57,530
TARDIS soaring on his time machine from

00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:02,470
Doctor Who so you are in England so I

00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:05,480
went to put this image I will end up in

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:08,660
Europe item last year so that's the

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,940
photo of some discussions but not in

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:15,710
discussion but some of the people was

00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:19,760
close by so was Thomas Thomas is in the

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:22,760
back here and I was in one of the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,610
helping desk and someone show up saying

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,610
so can you help me with something called

00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,220
gypsy notebooks names like yes so what

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:35,630
do you need and that the tent was like

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,150
so I have to create some reports but

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,000
every time I need to put some logo and

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:44,170
night reports because my boss need those

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,880
parts should be archiving something and

00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:48,830
all their knowledge for the reports are

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,530
on gypsy notebooks

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:55,100
but I at the end I just when she like

00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:57,110
include the logo and I went to save time

00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,050
because I don't want you keep doing that

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,230
every time that Annie was like because

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:04,970
at the moment I generates the light that

00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:07,550
code and then I need to add in the late

00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,890
ed code so I don't want you keeping a

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,560
date in the files every time because as

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,590
you might know as a software developer

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,110
if you need to keep doing things every

00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:22,310
time again it's a problem so that's why

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,700
you want to automate and at that time on

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:29,330
the tables like yeah you could like

00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:31,970
create a later class and try to avoid to

00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:35,510
do most of the editing and Tom was like

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,640
oh no but you can have customs templates

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,680
for NB convert it was like oh yeah

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:43,490
that's true

00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:47,630
so for so that's was like it's funny

00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:50,020
because I never I was using that option

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:54,740
a long time ago but I kind of forgot

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:57,560
what was so this is a demo time just to

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,910
give your idea of how any convert and

00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,910
they're custom templates work

00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:12,070
we're going to do this on the shell

00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:15,070
thinks it's okay for people on the

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:22,510
audience to read so there's a few files

00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:26,440
here they 0 4 - count dot I pi n EB is

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:33,610
just a jupiter notebook so if I do lies

00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:36,070
on that for you it's just a JSON format

00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,460
if you have open that file without let's

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:42,910
use a plane tax so there's nothing extra

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:46,150
space on that one and there is a

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,820
template here this food template that I

00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:52,720
basically just download from the source

00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:57,030
code from the note and be convert so

00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:01,630
it's exactly the same file and they use

00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:03,760
ginger too so if you ever edit any of

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,530
the gene to file suit template so you're

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,180
going to be familiar with these

00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:12,250
instructions X n so it's just saying

00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,230
that's extending one previous template

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:18,190
and there's blockers and so on and not

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:21,160
going to tip on this one but it can

00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:24,010
create a can use that template to

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:28,620
generate the HTML 5 from the ipython

00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:32,560
notebook so I can type trip and be

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:36,600
comfort and I can pass the file you can

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:43,830
use template and I can pass a file so

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:46,930
for GPL and I can pass a file name and

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,240
it's going to generate saying that it

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,250
comfort so I just want you switch the

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,800
screen to open on the browser so it's

00:12:53,250 --> 00:13:01,510
this one yeah

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:04,630
so that's the output I just refer so you

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:05,860
can see and it's pretty similar of one

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:08,830
of these screens that I show you before

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:11,770
on the Jupiter notebook but if I want

00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,890
you say oh I want you add some extra

00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,480
information I can build on top of that

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,839
template so

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,899
I have a cousin a here and they're just

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:28,720
going to show you what if so you can see

00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:36,100
what I make the change fool Tempe and

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:39,760
cause a T and P so I just add this line

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:42,279
so is just say you know Python 2018 so

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,850
it's just before all the notebook

00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:50,440
information they can use jublia again

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:55,540
and be convert a template and now I

00:13:50,440 --> 00:14:07,889
going to change the template to question

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:07,889
a dot TPL and I want output as 0 for

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:24,370
question a and a notebook itself so it's

00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:27,100
mm sorry there's a typo here it's using

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,930
now the template my custom template and

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,819
converting the notebook

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:36,850
so what's writing and I don't you open

00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:39,069
on the browser so this is the new one

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,579
just refreshing so be sure that's going

00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:47,139
there so that is a Europe item 2018 here

00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:49,720
on the top so in as a any minimal

00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:53,889
example I can do something I can

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,709
customize that my template and then I

00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:59,260
want to do something more interesting

00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:03,310
just like not just a tax I can maybe

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:07,510
image so that's the second one so the

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:13,550
difference between the food and the

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:15,990
question be so I just add an image yeah

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:20,410
[Music]

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:24,910
so you can see ya so just a HTML tag

00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:26,949
with the image and you can convert using

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,550
the same command just changing the

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:36,700
template here

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:40,420
this one and I'm going to switch to the

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:44,170
other one so then I have the logo of the

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:46,870
Euro Python thousand 18 here so the idea

00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:49,600
is like if I can do this with like just

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,330
changing one line of code I might be

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,040
able to add in your kind of information

00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:57,160
that my employee might want you have

00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:01,930
from the reports dello that address any

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:04,540
email or anything so that's what Thomas

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:07,750
had suggest to her to use this feature

00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:14,430
from any be convert and it was like this

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:17,320
looks very good but it's kind of that

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,330
uses are just accessing the Gupta

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:24,640
notebook and see some at the top of the

00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:27,220
iceberg and that's just 10% the 19% of

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,920
everything is under the water and no

00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,770
one's kind of seen that was the case of

00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,840
that attending and the same attending

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,040
that was like yesterday on the

00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:40,960
beginner's day it's like maybe you can

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,330
see if you can prove that and they make

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,280
that my more visible in terms of

00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:47,860
templates and so on and that's what I

00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,200
end up talking with Thomas on last year

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,050
it's like what I can do and it was like

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:55,360
maybe you can send a proposal and I was

00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,090
like okay I know that like python has

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,570
proposals they have their pets and I was

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:05,200
already kind of familiar I read a few of

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:09,790
them special step 8 that's about coding

00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:11,650
for months it's like okay Thomas told me

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,900
that there is a tube 10 last man

00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:17,110
proposes very subtle looking online and

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,510
it's like okay there's a kid repository

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,670
that's from the Jupiter organization in

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,920
Scotland last-minute proposal seems like

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,959
reading the readme and it's like yeah

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,810
that's the procedure a friend suggests

00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,000
something can copy one of a file is

00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:35,140
correct and directory open a pull

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,450
request so that's what I decide to do I

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:40,090
decide to open a pull request saying

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,610
like can you add templates as metadata

00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,920
and this design enlargement proposal

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,600
for this powe request and you can see

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:52,210
that no man had that comment just left

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:54,790
to me so my idea was because I want to

00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:56,110
reuse the same template over and over

00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:59,049
again every time that the going to

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,090
export is it supposed to be saved

00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:04,510
somewhere so that's why each me

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,270
something on the notebook format not

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,730
just the note Jupiter interface so

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,780
that's why I end up sending the proposal

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,730
and there is a few comments below and I

00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,580
include like eye image a screenshot or

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,130
this is how I envision the idea you can

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,440
go to the Jupiter interface and you can

00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:25,419
say this is I want to set a template

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,000
that's my template custom template that

00:18:25,419 --> 00:18:31,900
I would use in later you can just go and

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,270
download that at the end we had some

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,730
discussions on the issue but I ended up

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,850
being too busy to just portion get like

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,820
a kind of prototype and explore more the

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:46,299
ideas and if you propose something can

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:50,230
you really not able to take forward with

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:51,640
lots of time it kind of keep open people

00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,860
was very welcome

00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,419
from everyone from the Gypsy community

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:58,020
sending feedbacks and so on so it's kind

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:01,929
of my fault not have too much time but

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,950
that was what I want to share with you

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:05,799
today

00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:08,620
I want to thank special Thomas for all

00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:12,220
their contributions and for me to share

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,049
this and if you have questions I open to

00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:16,150
having questions now if you want to make

00:19:14,049 --> 00:19:19,330
questions later on Twitter or anything

00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:22,260
that's my AG and Chinese IT thank you

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,260
very much to listen

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:37,520
I think other any questions no what kind

00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,430
of say give enough time to sell for

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,550
implemented how big of a job do you

00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:50,090
think is implement one of these

00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:53,120
proposals main challenge was just like

00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:57,890
learning how they insides of like how

00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:02,000
any big convert walks and the order that

00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:07,730
it breeds files because the challenge is

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,920
like if I started any not the name of

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:13,280
the template that I want to use it's

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,350
inside the notebook but they only

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,700
convert he started doing some things

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:22,850
before open the notebook so I kind of

00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,520
was like I'm changing this part it's

00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:28,040
like you're not super treeview you kind

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:30,050
of need you open the notebook and at

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,480
that moment you kind of past that and

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:35,030
later you can say okay I have that piece

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,450
of information and now I need to go back

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:41,809
and change the default one okay so that

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:45,200
was the most like time consuming that I

00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:46,160
didn't have time to devote to much in

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,860
Python

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,230
yeah and we've converted in Python is

00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:54,110
fully fighting the templates they have a

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:57,140
series of templates and those templates

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:59,929
are in change at you okay yeah that's

00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,540
your Python and there's the Jupiter

00:20:59,929 --> 00:21:04,640
notebook these are fully Python or other

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,400
other bits of know Jupiter notebook

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,809
there's lots of JavaScript oh they use

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:16,130
interface yeah make sincere anyone any

00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:18,590
questions before we wrap up okay well

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,679
thank you again thank you for listening
