	How to develop your project from an idea to architecture design in 50 minutes
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Kilsyth]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Anastasiia Tymoshchuk

Have you ever asked yourself: 
- how and where to start developing a new project from the scratch, 
- how to choose main components of a new software or how to develop a new feature, 
- how to decide whether your project needs refactoring, 
- how to avoid repeating the same issues? 
This talk will answer all these questions.  

You will learn:
- how to develop the idea from scratch, 
- how to use principles of Object Oriented Analysis and Design, 
- how to show amazing architecture design.  

You will get better understanding where and how to start, analyze and decouple the system, create a clean, clear and extendable architecture.

thank you for coming to my talk my name

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,309
is Anastasia Timur shook and this talk

00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,039
actually was designed and created by 2

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,650
cos speakers and function the the second

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,740
first speaker speaker couldn't come

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:27,539
today but I will present also her part I

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,090
will do my best so here is the link you

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,279
can follow the all the presentation

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,309
slides and also use all the links

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,739
because all the slides are equipped with

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:41,610
all the links to some sources with more

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,980
information and maybe to some free

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:46,920
advice --is which you can use later and

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:52,949
with all the pictures and examples and

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,379
everything so what is the talk about how

00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:59,059
many of you have any ideas which you

00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:03,180
want to present just give me some hints

00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,339
ok maybe some projects or maybe some

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:07,409
features it doesn't matter if you have

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,490
any idea and you want to present it to

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:15,299
somebody for example your chief or C or

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:18,119
C for somebody who even is not a

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,280
technical person then probably you need

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,860
to have some skills of presentation and

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,979
everything it's not just of presenting

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,770
some slides it's about showing your idea

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,250
and developing it further and if you

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,829
have some idea and you you're stuck with

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,990
that or you don't know how to go with it

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:44,090
so probably it's the right place to sit

00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:47,520
actually in my experience I had the

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,430
problem when together was a team of 10

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,829
people we created the amazing back-end

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,649
it was super great it was working

00:01:52,829 --> 00:02:00,750
perfectly it was saving hours and hours

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:03,360
of working time so it was saving like 2

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,060
hours per day per developer for the team

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,179
of 500 people that's a lot I would say

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,629
and also we presented that project was

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,410
amazing back-end and some kind of no

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,730
front-end

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:21,120
no UI to our customer and we said hey

00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,310
you can just see URL and just get the

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,810
results and get everything done and then

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,390
you will get the file with all the

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,520
results and he said yeah but there is

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,770
another team and they are presenting

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,080
kind of the same so they are working in

00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,780
the same field yeah you don't know about

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,550
them but they showed us amazing UI

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,500
amazing thing yeah they don't have

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,110
back-end but they will probably win

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,490
because they have something which you

00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,610
can click and then you will get

00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,690
something and we said yeah yeah wait we

00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:54,060
will do our job we will do everything in

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:57,300
a week and then yeah we speed up we were

00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,900
working hard and making as much as we

00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,510
can and we presented also UI so we kind

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,030
of won that battle but sometimes you

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,640
would be in the place when you cannot

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,310
really have the second chance so you got

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,100
the idea you got the feeling that it's

00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,130
something which will be super great

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,410
which will save all the time which you

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:21,120
can help with all the developers but

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,550
then you cannot present it fine you

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,160
cannot show it and then you are failing

00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:29,700
I will help you with that I will help

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:32,250
you to create your idea from just raw

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,910
idea to the architecture design so let's

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,860
start first of all I would like to tell

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,160
you some words about my company because

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,610
they are supporting me a lot also in my

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,690
skills and also developing myself so

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:48,780
it's a siren

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,850
it's a internet security company I will

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,489
show you some short video about the

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:58,520
company maybe you saw it already in the

00:03:53,489 --> 00:04:01,470
previous session siren is developing

00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:05,489
system as a service center loans

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:08,820
solution for business companies we are

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:12,720
on the cloud we are parsing all the

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:15,030
emails from our partners and then saying

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:19,169
if it's palm or not vision or everything

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:22,680
and as everything is on the cloud so we

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:26,550
are as fast as it could be and if there

00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,900
is a new attack already alive then

00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,690
it's taken usually some minutes or maybe

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:37,349
maximum hours to fix it and then its

00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:40,500
life for all the speakers and sorry for

00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:43,979
this because for all the people which

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,900
are using our services so it's really

00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:51,389
nice to have such a speed because some

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,360
old solutions where you need to install

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:57,599
all the software on your company's

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,930
servers then you it will take ages and

00:04:57,599 --> 00:05:03,629
ages to update and to get those updates

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,300
and then install and everything so it's

00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:14,840
not really so fast as it should be

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:17,699
nowadays we have different services for

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:22,530
anti-spam solutions to check the emails

00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:27,449
and also to answer the customers we have

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:29,870
some our inside internal tools which I'm

00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:34,400
development currently and here in my

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:37,500
daily tasks I'm dealing a lot with

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,469
designing some new ideas and then I need

00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,419
to present it to sometimes to my

00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:47,009
colleagues sometimes to my boss and then

00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:49,740
to make him believe that my idea my

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:52,139
feature will work and even if I will

00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,199
show him amazing architecture but it

00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:59,430
will be just some short schema he will

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,159
say that might not work and then I'm

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,520
trying to do my best to keep up with all

00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:09,210
the technologies and everything and then

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:14,009
they are accepting more times my talks

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:16,349
and my ideas so what's in the talk we

00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:19,830
will start with some basic concepts then

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:22,849
we will visualize the idea we will take

00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:27,090
one simple example to show everything

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:29,430
and see how to develop it then we will

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:31,860
talk a little bit about with our visual

00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,469
style and then we will go a bit deeper

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:37,409
to object oriented analysis and design

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:39,479
approach and then just jump to some

00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:43,139
conclusions

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:47,219
so let's dive into basics what is the

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:50,819
design design as you can read everywhere

00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:53,339
it's just a creation of some plan of an

00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:56,099
object which you can think in your mind

00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:57,979
so it's like a representation object of

00:06:56,099 --> 00:07:01,259
the object

00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:03,779
what is the visual design is a visual

00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,870
representation somewhere on the media

00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:10,289
maybe in some photos pictures some

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:15,240
mock-ups and everything what is software

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:20,270
design is a special design for creating

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:23,819
of a new software what is architecture

00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:27,060
architecture is also a process and the

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:30,719
product of creating some plans and some

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,889
schemas and some design steps

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:37,169
how will the product will look like what

00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:39,479
a software architecture it's mostly

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:42,870
about software about creating the

00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:45,120
software and creating some schemas only

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,999
about the software how it is going to

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,800
work so building a software architecture

00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:55,709
is always about trade-offs as you can

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,779
see I have this huge list of system

00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,060
quality attributes and if you will

00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:02,430
fulfill all of them I have written just

00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:06,089
a few of them so if you will fulfill all

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:11,009
of them it will take years to build such

00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:13,499
a solution it will be so expensive and

00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,419
time-consuming and you need thousand

00:08:13,499 --> 00:08:17,639
million developers to fulfill that and

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:20,509
I'm not sure that is even possible to

00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,889
fulfill all of the requirements so

00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:25,919
building of the software it's always

00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:30,360
about trade-offs depending on how much

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:33,419
resources and time you have it will be a

00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,490
different architecture and different

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,649
software for example if you are running

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,839
out of time and you need to run it as

00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:43,459
soon as possible then you will probably

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:47,220
take something smaller maybe some

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:50,970
smaller features some shorter features

00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,329
and maybe like you will go to monolith

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,339
structure

00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:59,980
not maybe you will go further into some

00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:03,189
micro services or just services so it's

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,829
always about trade-offs so let's start

00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:09,269
here as you can see at the photo is

00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:11,679
working a place of visual designer

00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:16,660
actually it's a place of my second call

00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:19,149
speaker let's try to build the idea on

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:24,339
based on some example then you will see

00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:28,689
how is it going to work how many of you

00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:34,809
have swapped something like clothes jobs

00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:38,949
or whatever homes working places did use

00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:41,439
of something okay but actually it's

00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:44,139
really really popular I searched and we

00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:47,290
on the internet and job swap idea it's

00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:50,949
not really well developed so for example

00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:54,189
you are working as a Python developer

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:58,540
but actually you were always dreaming to

00:09:54,189 --> 00:10:01,209
be a Python keeper if you want to take

00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:05,379
care of pythons or maybe gorila so maybe

00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:08,559
some other activities maybe you wanted

00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:10,720
to make tea in your life but actually

00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,569
you are software developer so you cannot

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,019
really go there and just work as a queue

00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:19,929
keeper you can kind of just switch so

00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:22,600
that's the idea to switch for one single

00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:25,269
day just to try yourself if you will

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,139
work in this area and if you need to

00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:31,119
speed up with learning of something new

00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:33,549
it's just for example it's not project

00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:38,589
that's a real one maybe in the future

00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:43,449
but yes so in this area we have the idea

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:46,689
of job swap when you have a job still

00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:49,439
have it for sure and you want to swap

00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:53,850
with somebody and there is another

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:57,939
somebody who wants to do the same so

00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:01,559
let's analyze for sure we will have some

00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:04,779
registered user and unregistered user

00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,649
now we defined user types we have two of

00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:08,509
them

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:11,509
let's define what is unregistered user

00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:14,110
is going to do at the website for

00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:17,540
example we have a website for job swaps

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:22,970
like I don't know swap your home but for

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:26,120
jobs and registered to you the user is

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:28,579
coming to website and he understands

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,810
everything how is it working how is it

00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:35,180
looking like so it's like a process

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:37,790
mmm which I'm showing right now it's how

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:41,000
to develop your idea you had the idea of

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,100
a job swap website and then you are

00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,290
starting with development with the

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,509
defining of user types then the next

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,670
step you are defining how are they

00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:53,360
behaving this is a behavior of

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:57,380
unregistered user and this is behavior

00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,589
of registered users now you defined how

00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,690
are they aware of the website how is it

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:11,810
going to look like will define later

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:15,529
your like UI and your design how do we

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:19,519
decide how to show the website and how

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:22,209
to create it we can do our conclusions

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,790
based on mood and on target audience

00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:27,949
mood for example you can describe your

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,399
project with some keywords some

00:12:27,949 --> 00:12:39,250
associations with the job swap idea any

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:48,230
ideas of job swap moods for example okay

00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:52,130
yes yes that's true then we will define

00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:54,800
in target audience who's our target

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,290
audience for sure it's somebody who is

00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,680
willing to swap something who is going

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:04,250
to try something new and somebody who is

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,790
as couraged as jumping on something new

00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:11,029
and doing some crazy stuff but for sure

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:14,899
the user should have a job you have a

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:16,790
possibility of swap I defined here some

00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:18,079
mood types and some target audience

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:20,480
types

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,720
the mood could be like business

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,050
experience fine life change the mood

00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,689
will define how the main page will look

00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,269
like for example if it's more like a

00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:34,549
business style than you probably have to

00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,309
look for some similar pages about

00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:40,549
business style if it's just for fun and

00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:43,249
you are targeting audience just to have

00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:47,540
fun there then probably it's another

00:13:43,249 --> 00:13:49,759
coloring and style and everything so

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,319
let's dive a bit more about in the

00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:58,579
visual design visualization of the idea

00:13:54,319 --> 00:14:02,959
I will consist of defining basic

00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:08,029
elements then creating the wireframes so

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:11,689
website wireframes is the skeletal like

00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:16,189
mock-up of the website it's how will the

00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:18,679
user experience look like for that we

00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:20,899
can use something like that we can just

00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,149
define that here we will have a catchy

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,689
picture there we will have like a button

00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:30,769
or something and that we will while

00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:33,769
doing that we will develop more our idea

00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:38,389
and we will define what do we really

00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:40,970
need in our idea actually this is a

00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:43,540
special case because you are presenting

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,649
your own idea you are not taking

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,569
requirements from somebody you are not

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:49,999
taking requirements from your customer

00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:51,980
or somebody if you will have a customer

00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:55,999
then probably everything you need to ask

00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:58,670
from them and those steps are also

00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:01,040
possible but they should be a bit

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:03,410
changed because then you will probably

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,889
have some requirements and then you can

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:08,749
jump to other parts or you will not have

00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:14,809
the requirements and then you can ask

00:15:08,749 --> 00:15:17,239
more questions so I will show you the

00:15:14,809 --> 00:15:21,429
example of wireframes for unregistered

00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:25,549
user it's a like a great hand line with

00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:30,740
this description of the main idea and

00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:30,990
also some like hints where to go and

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,700
what

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:38,520
to do then it will explain how the job

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,670
swap idea is working and then it will

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,470
show some hot jobs for a district user

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,779
everything will be a bit different

00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,820
because he knows everything how is it

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:51,660
working and what to do on the webpage

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:55,110
and how to proceed with that so then it

00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:03,209
will have just applications and just a

00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:08,690
simple search for creation of that

00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:15,870
mock-ups we used figma I can show you

00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:18,300
maybe it's taking some time to render so

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:21,510
figma is for free you can just register

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,520
done it's really easy to create a

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:27,600
mock-up just to create a page to put

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:30,990
some sort of boxers black or red or

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,890
something and then just to render it and

00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:38,760
show it how's it going to look like

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:40,890
let's wait a little bit more so here we

00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:52,140
have registered user on the side and

00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:55,829
then unregistered user hmm maybe

00:16:52,140 --> 00:17:00,180
Internet is too fast today yes finally

00:16:55,829 --> 00:17:02,370
it's done so this is for unregistered

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,709
user we have headline and then we have

00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,140
all the description it's a one single

00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:09,270
page application for sure we want our

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,959
user to stay on the page that's why it's

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:17,400
built like that and then we have all the

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:22,470
other stuff to have to get the attention

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:26,130
of the user let's develop further

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:28,650
so about visualization of the idea we

00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,640
also we already use target audience and

00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:34,800
then mood and spirit of the website and

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,290
there is another thing which we need to

00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:41,070
think about it's the color colors

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:43,050
typography images and icons so visual

00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:44,260
style examples for sure if you are

00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,410
developing something

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,750
then you need to search on the Internet

00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:54,040
if there is something which is pretty

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:57,940
similar for swap you can think like

00:17:54,040 --> 00:18:01,060
maybe Airbnb might be a great idea or

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,090
maybe it's more like business it's a

00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:07,060
news website and this is couchsurfing

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:10,540
it's also about kind of swapping homes

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:12,580
not really but a little bit and then let

00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,320
me meet up it's like hosting a meet up

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:18,460
and then organizing something it's more

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:22,900
about adventurous people this is about

00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:24,880
life exploration so the thing is when

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:28,630
you are thinking about your idea you

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:33,130
need to check some others ideas because

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:37,000
you need to use similar colors which

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:40,180
will follow you or the user follow the

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,730
user to use the same kind of experience

00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,550
spirit and pattern which is used by

00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,790
something which is already well-known

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:54,520
for example if you will take a news

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:57,010
website for news idea for a dating

00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,340
website then it might not be work

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,920
because it's like too cold and not that

00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:06,220
great for meeting other people not that

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,510
adventurous and so that's why you need

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:13,920
to keep updated with all of the news and

00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:17,140
all of the ideas already online

00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,970
psychology behind the colors also you

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,050
need to check which color you want to

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,600
use if it's appropriate or not you can

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:27,730
check that a bit later

00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:31,690
typography there are different kind of

00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:33,910
types fonts it's better to use not that

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,730
hard to read and understand so the last

00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,920
one is totally and unreadable and if you

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:40,860
want to make a headline with that then

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:45,700
it's probably not the best idea ever

00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:46,540
usually the normal one which is San

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,330
serif

00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:52,300
it's used it doesn't have this serious

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:55,210
thing and it's more readable it's more

00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,450
easy to understand and to catch up the

00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:57,450
idea

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:05,320
so job swap website design we have

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,720
already created it let's take a look how

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:12,760
is it looking like if you would like to

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:17,320
apply for something like that it's a

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:18,940
main page for unregistered user it's

00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:25,860
looking like that and then it's

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:31,200
explaining all of the steps three steps

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,200
and the hot jobs of course

00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:38,920
and some successful stories as usual

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,560
some reviews some partners social links

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:56,930
and for registered user is just

00:20:51,320 --> 00:21:07,700
applications recommended jobs and all

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:09,770
the same social links and partners we

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,740
have some links with some free graphic

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:16,070
resources we can use unsplash.com to get

00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:19,400
some photos and everything which is for

00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:23,560
free and you can just use it also icons

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:27,890
and prototype in a figma was used and

00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:31,280
then now it's object-oriented part how

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,350
to design back-end part this is my table

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,900
it's looking like that it's almost the

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:40,400
same as designers but it has some more

00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:43,970
modeling there so let's start about

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:47,060
basics of object-oriented approach this

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:50,390
approach is about showing everything as

00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:54,700
an object you need to define main object

00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:57,970
and then made object and then just

00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:01,220
develop it primary types of

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:04,850
object-oriented design is to define

00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:06,800
objects to describe them and to show how

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:11,770
they relate it and how are they working

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:15,620
with each other object or analysis tools

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:17,660
how many of you used UML or C form model

00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:22,640
or any of them

00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:26,360
UML yes that's nice

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,210
actually UML is most commonly used it's

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,790
not that simple as can be but there are

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:36,230
a lot of books and all of the sources

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:43,100
how to work with it and non UML which I

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:44,410
really like it's a c4 model maybe I will

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:47,470
show you

00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,950
the idea but the idea behind the c4

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,600
model which I really like is that

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:56,170
everything is super simple it shouldn't

00:22:52,600 --> 00:23:00,250
be so decorated you shouldn't show some

00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:05,050
component structures as they're hard to

00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:09,400
understand so this is like a model where

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:11,440
you have just boxes with names and then

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,270
if you will even decorate yeah it will

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,430
feel better you will understand more

00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:18,180
but even if you remove all the

00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:23,730
decorations then it will be still

00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:32,650
understandable and clear to update it to

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:38,950
share with somebody so I will show you

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:41,920
my example with some different models as

00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:45,520
we defined on the previous steps our use

00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,490
cases for unregistered user and

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:54,870
registered user we now we can develop it

00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:59,920
further for this design let's keep the

00:23:54,870 --> 00:24:03,640
diagram up to date it's a use case which

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,940
we wanted to develop so the start is

00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,620
how's the use case is working the user

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,840
is coming to the website then it's

00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,330
entering the city then checking all the

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,980
available jobs and then finding

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,670
something interesting then clicking

00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:21,760
apply and then if it's registered and

00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:24,840
applying it is more information if not

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:30,130
registered than registration form and

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:35,050
some other step for unregistered but

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:39,070
what are the main components for example

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:42,760
we will defined a few who define few of

00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,130
them like a user a job and application

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,910
and maybe a job swap offer and maybe

00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:51,220
some results of application it was

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:55,270
written by hand by the way I didn't use

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,340
any tools so at the very beginning when

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,760
you are not sure about

00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:02,200
architecture you will start with the

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,060
building the components and then

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,370
thinking and analyzing how are they

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:10,090
going to work together for example user

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:13,270
will have the application or will create

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:15,760
the application and then a user will got

00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:18,340
a job swap offer and the job swap offer

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,770
will probably be connected to a job for

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:28,690
sure it will be and the application will

00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:31,630
have some results of the application so

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:34,180
the components diagram will look like

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:37,540
that will have like database of users

00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,360
database of applications database of

00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:45,760
jobs and then they will be related to

00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:48,280
job with a submit a job component it's

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,310
not only an object it's more about

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,760
component which is working on some

00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:56,880
function it can be like a micro service

00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:02,740
also it can be like a part of the

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:06,100
monolith structure also depending how

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:09,340
much time we have how much time and

00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:12,190
money then we will define less or more

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:15,280
models it's more simplified we just need

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,830
user bunch of jobs application and maybe

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:20,020
results or even we can get rid of

00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,460
results we can put their everything in

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:25,810
application then we will have a

00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:29,650
component as a user which has a job and

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:35,140
the application with the job offer see

00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:39,390
for model see for model will look like

00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:42,880
that it will show the components of our

00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:44,500
application for sure we have single page

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,500
application which is providing

00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:50,440
everything and which is based on the

00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:52,480
idea to keep the user on the page we

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,210
will have database in all of the

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,580
structures there and then we will have

00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:03,310
some components sign in register form

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:08,680
submitted job service for example form

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:09,720
offer but on the swap of users it will

00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,760
be

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:15,030
something based on the Preferences of

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:22,050
user for example and submit an

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:24,930
application object-oriented design when

00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:28,790
you created those models and you defined

00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:31,950
the base components then for sure you

00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:34,650
will go for the object-oriented design

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:37,530
you have an object and then you need to

00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:38,910
define how they are related with each

00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,480
other how they are working with each

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,750
other

00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:47,150
then you can create database you can

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:53,700
create flow how is it going to work and

00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:56,340
use for that different models so the

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,730
input for object-oriented design should

00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:00,870
be provided on the previous step as a

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:03,660
object-oriented analysis when you have

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,820
all of the forms defined and then you

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:09,030
need just to use that and as input

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:11,580
sometimes if you are not your own

00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:13,980
designer and developer and then you will

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:16,980
have all of those requirements already

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,460
and then it will be a part of a design

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:24,300
already so it depends really on your

00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,250
structure and on your system then you

00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,490
will have different ways of

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:33,990
understanding but if you have the idea

00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:37,230
and you need to develop it then think

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:41,040
how is it going to work how the user

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,940
will experience there on the website and

00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:50,550
how do you want to build it as fast as

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:58,190
possible as good as you can or just

00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:58,190
cheap do you have any questions yes

00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
questions

00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,330
if you have any questions just raise

00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:14,330
your hand

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:26,169
I thank you for the talk

00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:30,950
so you start off with well building a

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:32,509
front page design basically how do you

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:37,940
how do you validate the day this is a

00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:39,200
good design actually it depends how

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,330
you're going to present if you are

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,490
presented to somebody then you will get

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:52,389
the feedback for sure you will win or

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:52,389
not okay oh thanks any other questions

00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:16,700
Oh ha sometimes there is somebody over

00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:20,470
here hello how do you make the entire

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:24,320
process to be incremental from the

00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:27,800
analyzes of the application the end and

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:33,290
delivery you mean to add more features

00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:42,250
or yes add more feature in like agile

00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:46,730
way do you take feedback from clients or

00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:50,990
users or yeah thank you for the question

00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:53,720
so it depends how is your workflow is if

00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:56,000
you need to present to somebody and to

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,630
get the feedback right away and you need

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,420
to just show somebody and to win the

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,180
tender or to get the feedback or to

00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,580
convince somebody to go for it then you

00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:10,790
will probably say I need a week for that

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:12,500
and then I will show it and if it's more

00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:16,070
about building the software architecture

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:18,470
at work and probably you will have a

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,590
team and then you will have Sprint's

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:25,640
ethics and so on so you will have an

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:30,490
epic to create a design of like a visual

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:34,430
design then another epic to create some

00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:36,710
back-end part some design and then you

00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:39,230
will have a feedback so you will say I

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:41,900
need to finish those epics and then I

00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,180
will show you if not and depends of

00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,920
course on your project if you will show

00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:47,540
that just a part of it and then get a

00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:51,380
feedback then you can change something

00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:53,210
but for sure you I will be changed

00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:56,420
that's why we are not programming here

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:58,460
the UI part we are just showing how can

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,500
it look like and then we are showing

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,560
also the components sometimes you need

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:09,620
to change everything in two years what

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:13,550
we did yes what I'm wondering for a

00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:17,390
startup it's better to start with

00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:22,970
and add more features after that based

00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:26,030
on users feedback so the question was

00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:27,920
more for a product manager or product

00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:30,230
owner not for the development part

00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,810
because yeah we know the developer

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,540
development will follow the business

00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:37,700
after all I would say it's better to

00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:39,770
start with a small feature just to run

00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:43,550
it live or to show to somebody and get

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:45,980
the feedback then to go so huge then you

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:48,290
need to develop like one year or two

00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,120
years it's better to show something

00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:53,120
small and then get the feedback right

00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:55,670
away or just to be fast on the market

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,890
because some sometimes somebody will

00:32:55,670 --> 00:33:11,900
take your idea yes thank you thank you

00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:14,810
any other questions do you think I have

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:17,190
the power to dismiss you but we do that

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:23,489
let's thank the speaker

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:23,489
