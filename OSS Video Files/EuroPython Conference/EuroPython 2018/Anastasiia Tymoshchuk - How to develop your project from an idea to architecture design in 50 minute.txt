Have you ever asked yourself: 
- how and where to start developing a new project from the scratch, 
- how to choose main components of a new software or how to develop a new feature, 
- how to decide whether your project needs refactoring, 
- how to avoid repeating the same issues? 
This talk will answer all these questions.  

You will learn:
- how to develop the idea from scratch, 
- how to use principles of Object Oriented Analysis and Design, 
- how to show amazing architecture design.  

You will get better understanding where and how to start, analyze and decouple the system, create a clean, clear and extendable architecture.
