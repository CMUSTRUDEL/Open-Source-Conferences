We’ll start with the basics you need to know as an app developer about interacting with your database, then dig into how you can start to analyze performance. We’ll look at things you need to know for a small application, then the things you should be cautious of as you start to layer in other items you need to be aware of for performance including:


Cache hit ratio
Index hit ratio
Proper use of indexes
Bloat
Efficient joins
Sharding
