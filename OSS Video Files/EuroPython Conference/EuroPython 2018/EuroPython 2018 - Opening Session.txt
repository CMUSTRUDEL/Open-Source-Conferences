	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:14,670
hello and welcome to European 2018 so we

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:20,250
made it again this year it was a lot of

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:22,859
work this year we in Edinburgh obviously

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,140
it's almost as warm as in Remini the

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:35,219
weather is at least as nice so I think

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:36,770
we made a good choice so we want to give

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,420
a special welcome to all the new

00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,969
European Easter so people who come here

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,680
for the first time how many of you are

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:49,350
here can you raise your hands please

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:51,239
Wow that's excellent so we'd like to ask

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,280
the regulars who come here very often

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,039
because we have many many regulars to

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,570
help these new people integrate into the

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,059
conference and feel comfortable and feel

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,250
at home at the conference because we're

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,309
all a big family and and this is a very

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:10,080
nice event and it Betty lives by what

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:12,510
you put into the event we also want to

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,490
welcome our responses of course because

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,040
without the sponsors this would be

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,420
almost impossible to do just to give you

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,000
an idea the sponsors pay for almost 200

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,920
euros per for every single ticket on

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,590
average that you buy for the conference

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,150
so the prices would go up a lot if we

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:35,910
would not have these sponsors so I think

00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:42,110
we should give him a hand a big hand

00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:45,180
[Applause]

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:48,720
and especially two smart kids which is

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,180
our Keystone sponsor this year you can

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,740
go down to Lenox sweet the way well the

00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:56,130
sponsor booths are they have some nice

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,840
things waiting for you there so who is

00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:59,880
making all this happen well it's

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,710
actually a very small team that makes it

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,670
happen and we're all doing this in our

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:09,210
free time none of us get paid for this

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:12,300
so it is a lot of work and of course we

00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,920
and of course we would like to we would

00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,630
like to have some recognition for that

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:22,380
as well so I'd like to ask all the

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:23,290
volunteers up on the stage now hey come

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,980
on guys

00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:31,830
[Music]

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:34,910
[Applause]

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,500
okay this is a subset as you can see

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:39,930
still fighting with tickets downstairs

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,330
and all right yes people are still

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,040
buying tickets very late so you can see

00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,510
all these names here all these people

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,060
have helped really a lot in the

00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:49,380
conference the the ones in red there

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,300
those are the board members of the

00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,700
European society the organisation behind

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,530
you're a Python but we also had help

00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:59,630
from lots of other people as you can see

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:04,380
here the team has 20 people in total and

00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:06,240
yeah this is how we made it happen the

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,540
organisation as I said behind this is

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,210
the European Society we used to run just

00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,490
Europe Python but we have more recently

00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:17,070
extended our mission to also help the

00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,560
Europe European Python community so if

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:21,240
you run a conference for example then

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,430
you can come to us and ask for grants

00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,770
for that conference we're going to

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,720
announce that it'll on a little larger

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,150
scale after the conference or maybe in

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,620
the next few days again it's all

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,930
volunteer driven you can join you can

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,420
help us if you want to participate in

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:40,620
this and we would like to have more

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,810
people join the European society we also

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,230
have on-site volunteers who help a lot

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,590
you can recognize them by by the t-shirt

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,780
color so they wear these yellow t-shirts

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:53,580
you can sign up as volunteer as well we

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,470
have a volunteers app for that you can

00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,080
go to the website to the volunteer

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,450
section and it has all the links you can

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,489
do session sharing for example you could

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,320
help with well can't help with setup

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,850
anymore but we can help with teardown

00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,160
and everything else that we have to do

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,489
throughout the conference so we'd

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,530
appreciate somewhere help there

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:16,380
if short Hitchhiker's Guide to your

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,450
Python these are basically the details

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:21,180
that you have to know Wi-Fi I think you

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,930
have already connected to Wi-Fi we only

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,720
have 5 G Wi-Fi in some cases people

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,890
don't have 5g on their devices in those

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,450
cases you can come to the conference

00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,880
desk and we can give you a separate

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,190
login for that we have the conference

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,020
app this isn't it

00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,000
you need to download the attend defi app

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,300
and then you search for the code your

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,310
prize in 2018 and it should give you the

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,020
the conference details and then this app

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,940
has all this

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:50,150
rules and everything so very nice up

00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,460
hashtag we use Europe Python we would

00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,560
like to ask you not to use ep 2018

00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:58,159
because there's a different event called

00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,259
Electric Picnic which happens which

00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:02,990
happens every year and so every year

00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,930
they use ep 2018 so there's kind of a

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:08,000
mix if you use ep 2018 we have a

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,270
telegram group which is working really

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,340
nicely to connect to each other so it's

00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,960
the channel is called Europe Ison and

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,449
then for everything else you just go to

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,940
the conference disk and we can help you

00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:23,409
something about the venue the venue is

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:28,370
is organized in different levels the

00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:31,190
most important level for like food and

00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:34,099
for coffee breaks is in level - - this

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,860
is all the way downstairs this is in the

00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:39,199
Lenox suite it's a huge hall that they

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,690
have down there we are currently at

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,610
level 3 and the other rooms are

00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,620
distributed between those levels at

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,020
close to the conference desk there is

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,389
there's a plan you can you can search

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,509
for the rooms there's something I want

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:56,210
to mention we have two sponsored rooms

00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:58,940
one is the the Pentland suite this is

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,580
where we're currently sitting in this is

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,930
sponsored by smart kids the Keystone

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:08,449
sponsor and then we also have the room

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,810
sit law it's called by the venue this is

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:13,370
sponsored by pycharm so those names are

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,969
different than what you see in the venue

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,430
as signage then of course you have your

00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:21,800
back or at least you you can pick it up

00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,190
downstairs so if you haven't yet you'll

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,630
find a European bottle in there again

00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:28,159
they were so popular we decided to have

00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:29,690
them again

00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:31,909
and of course you find lots of other

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,699
things in there like nice gadgets and

00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:40,819
lots of information coupon codes for

00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:43,969
your Riley for example right but you've

00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:46,069
all come here to not only grab a back

00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:48,319
but also to to hear some nice talks so

00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:50,990
we have a great lineup of keynotes we

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:53,210
have David Marco Ennis Nicole and iron

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,149
ore Ian I don't know how did this is

00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:58,110
pronounced maybe you can tell me

00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:00,840
Ian is yeah

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,470
and these are going to be very exciting

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,350
very interesting I think Marco is

00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,290
actually is he's logging in from

00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:14,630
Antarctica yeah so it's not physically

00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:17,280
here but we'll have him by a video link

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,080
we also have some other events we ran a

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
few events on the last two days two

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,340
training days we had the beginners day

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,860
workshop we had a jungle workshop for

00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,120
women we had the training sessions we

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,800
also had a few sponsored training

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,920
sessions that you were able to attend

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,750
without the training passes what we're

00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:36,240
going to have during the conferences

00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,250
we're going to have pi data tracks those

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,990
are marked in the schedule will have a

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,730
recruitment session in case you want to

00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,610
are looking for a new job

00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,310
we have helped us helped us is something

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,050
where you can go to a desk that we set

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,300
up in Lennox suite and then there are

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,010
certain projects they're running

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:55,340
helpdesk sessions you can go there ask

00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:58,440
questions and get answers from experts

00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,450
we have open space in two rooms so if

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,840
you want to self-organize into a session

00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,880
basically self-organized

00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,410
then you can go downstairs to the large

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,270
panel that we have next to the

00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,250
conference desk next to the large

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:14,310
schedule that we have there and you can

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:16,310
you can just get a slot there and then

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,510
run a session in one of these rooms and

00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,550
of course we have the poster session

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:22,710
posters are going to be set up in Lenox

00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,440
as well and those are usually very

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:28,350
interesting too so for the open spaces

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,820
how many of you do know do know what an

00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:35,940
open space is not for any of you so the

00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,800
way that it works is you go to the to

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,450
the through the grid that we have down

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,640
there you do take one of these post-its

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:43,080
you write a session name on it you post

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,470
it into one of the slots and then

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,300
basically that's not it's yours and then

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,680
you can do in that in that room whatever

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,370
you like of course you have to respect

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,350
the code of conduct and you can you can

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,240
have sessions this may not be used for

00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,440
commercial presentations but it's for

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,030
example if you have like you're an

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
open-source project that's perfectly

00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,360
fine to run a session there and do

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,580
something ad-hoc you can also have

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,830
discussions there like you can do panels

00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:09,990
whatever you like this is up to you what

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,460
you want to do there then we have

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,459
lightning talks how many of you know

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:16,950
lightning talks

00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:19,709
okay so almost all of you these are five

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,290
minute talks very short the content is

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,640
completely up to you of course it would

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,060
help if it had something to do with

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,470
Python you can make it you can make it

00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,870
funny you can make it interesting you

00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:32,700
could make it boring if you want to this

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,769
is also completely up to you after time

00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,589
permits is over so the sureno and the

00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:39,000
attendance is not too high and again

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,220
it's may not be used for commercial

00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,640
presentations so please know recruitment

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,649
or anything in those I mentioned the

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,290
conference app I hope you've downloaded

00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:52,079
it the schedule in there is the most up

00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,519
to date that we have it also has lots of

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,350
other information in there it works

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,120
offline so you if you don't have

00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:59,670
internet connectivity you still can get

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,839
and see the schedule you can rate

00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:05,610
sessions so there's this the star bar in

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,490
all for all these sessions so you can

00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,660
give ratings to those speakers are

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,880
usually interested in getting these

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,070
ratings afterwards so we try to publish

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,360
them this year

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,310
but of course this will only work if

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,350
enough people actually do the rating so

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,350
we'd like to ask you to use this feature

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,720
social event so usually at your path and

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,640
conferences we have a social event but

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,290
this year unfortunately we don't because

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,630
we could not find a venue that could

00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:37,500
hold the number of people like 500

00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,290
people and and then do a party there so

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,839
unfortunately we all we can do is we we

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,910
can just have an ad-hoc session we can

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,430
all meet at the Edinburgh grass market

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,110
for example which is it's a nice area as

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,600
plenty of pubs and restaurants and then

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,730
we can basically socialize there I think

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,529
that's the best that we can do you can

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,970
wear your badge just show that your your

00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,070
past attendee and you can get in touch

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,430
there you can have a few beers you can

00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:08,029
have some some food it's really close to

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:11,130
the ICC so you can usually work there

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,779
then we have a quiet room quiet room is

00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,730
for people who want to relax a bit who

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:18,480
want to get off of the busy stuff that's

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:23,160
going on here and this is in room Tinto

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,390
which is on the ground floor and of

00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,360
course we have a code of conduct so

00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:30,970
we'd like to ask you all to basically

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,970
adhere to this code of conduct its code

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,070
of conduct is very very simple of course

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:37,720
this is just a short version

00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:40,120
so essentially be nice to each other

00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,320
talk to each other communicate with each

00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,650
other

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,950
don't be intimidating don't be don't run

00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:49,660
any harassment the sponsors and everyone

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,140
who's coming from a company we'd like to

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,990
ask to be professional don't spam theirs

00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,840
you cannot run recruitment in in at the

00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:01,780

00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,940
