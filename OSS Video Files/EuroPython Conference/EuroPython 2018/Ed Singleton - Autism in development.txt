	Autism in development
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Moorfoot]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Ed Singleton

Autism is a condition that correlates with engineering.  Many people in the industry are diagnosed autistic, undiagnosed autistic, or near autistic.  There are many lessons that can be learned from how to deal with autistic people that are very useful in our industry.  These lessons are often also useful when dealing with non-autistic people.  There are many lessons on how to deal with your own autism that are useful to undiagnosed autistic people and near autistic people.

We will cover the basics of autism, and related conditions.  We will cover simple tricks that can make discussions and changes easier in workplaces ("10 Simple tricks to make your autistic colleagues shout less!").  We will also cover techniques you can use for dealing with your own autistic tendencies ("100 coping mechanisms to pretend that you are normal!").

I am a late diagnosis autistic person myself, and will discuss the difference between knowing and not knowing that you are autistic.

[Applause]

00:00:03,049 --> 00:00:09,269
hi so this is autism in the workplace

00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:11,490
I'm ed singleton there probably won't be

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:15,150
questions at the end my timings are

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,400
awful but if you do have questions tweet

00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,250
me I love being treated positive

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,609
negative feedback I like it

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,119
feel free to email me and the slides are

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,580
on the web at single tones comm slash

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,160
talks slash autism in the workplace

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,040
there's nothing else up there at the

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,180
moment apart from that this talk and you

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,030
can follow along at moment it should be

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,129
up at the moment but I'm hoping there

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,379
will be in future because I want to talk

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,480
about this and share information about

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:52,579
this topic a lot more I'm hoping to be a

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:57,030
bit more proactive me I'm artistic

00:00:52,579 --> 00:01:01,640
particularly specifically Asperger's I'm

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,850
high-functioning I actually realized

00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:10,670
about a year ago at PyCon UK and then I

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:13,710
got a formal diagnosis I would say I'm

00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,860
80/20 I'm 80% high-functioning

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,930
completely normal

00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:23,939
get on OK in social interactions and I'm

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:26,220
20% completely dysfunctional so rather

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,390
than being a even mix I'm sort of some

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,409
things I'm perfectly fine and some

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,210
things I'm terrible at so as a example

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,460
of that to sort of I've been trying to

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,409
work out ways of putting this in context

00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,350
I only been thinking about myself as an

00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,930
autistic person for a year and but I

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,270
have never decided where to live I'm 39

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,619
years old and I've never made that

00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,229
decision I've only made it for the first

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:51,960
time in my life this year as part of

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,649
kind of realizing that I need to change

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,950
and grow up and take more control of

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:05,820
specific parts of my life that I've been

00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:10,410
allowing to go on thought about autism

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,910
in general and Asperger's autism and

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,180
Asperger's have been merged together in

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,280
the latest D

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:22,810
Sam which is the dictionary that defines

00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:25,000
particular psychological disorders so

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:30,069
Asperger's doesn't exist anymore there's

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,659
just autistic spectrum condition now I

00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:36,549
don't think that's a particularly useful

00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:39,549
combination because for some people with

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:42,939
autism it's an utterly crippling

00:02:39,549 --> 00:02:45,909
disability and for quite a lot of other

00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:48,069
people it's something that actually can

00:02:45,909 --> 00:02:51,700
live a normal life to the time

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:55,510
perspective 16% of autistic people are

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,060
in full-time employment for disabled

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,620
people in general it's 48 percent and

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,750
actually in this country but doing

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,879
fairly well I know in other European

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,280
countries like Switzerland it's only 8

00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,040
percent of autistic people are in

00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:12,909
full-time employment and that includes

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,250
the Asperger's people so a lot of that

00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:19,449
16 percent are the high functioning

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:24,629
people high functioning is defined as an

00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:27,579
IQ of over 70 which is quite a low IQ

00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:32,979
you know I'm sure most people in this

00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:35,709
room are past that anyway and Asperger's

00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:38,549
is defined as not having any language

00:03:35,709 --> 00:03:41,680
difficulty whereas classic autism

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,680
includes language problems as well as an

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:49,659
IQ of below 70 if you're not high

00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:52,299
functioning clearly I'm not the very

00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:54,370
high functioning level in terms of

00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,720
autistic people when I sort of go and

00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:58,479
spend time with them I realized that

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,489
actually most of them wouldn't even put

00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,780
themselves in the situation of standing

00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:09,250
up here and talking and also wouldn't be

00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:11,079
able to sort of cope with this I don't

00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,169
want to spend too much time looking at a

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,539
formal definition of autism you can go

00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,009
on Wikipedia anyway like that just read

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:23,080
up on it well I would like to talk about

00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:27,100
some of it from the inside out just give

00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,930
my picture of it which I think

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,910
is particularly interesting in a stem

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,270
environment because it definitely seems

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,790
to occur a lot more in these

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:39,070
environments and also I think a lot of

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,500
people in our engineering science

00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,160
background are sort of partially

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,430
autistic or just somewhere up the scale

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,410
repetition and obsession is one of the

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:54,810
most notable famous characteristics of

00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:58,270
autism and so social awkwardness

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,570
there's over stimulation is one of the

00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,790
things that's less talked about outside

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,160
of autistic circles but it's one of the

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:11,080
things that most effects

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:13,870
high-functioning people that you're you

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,910
feel as if there's this flood of sensory

00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,010
information coming in all the time

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:20,380
there's no filter there's no sort of

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:22,630
what that it feels like there should be

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,640
a layer between you and everything else

00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:27,550
that sort of thins this outing just got

00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:31,180
this flood of visual information of

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:34,110
audio information of smells things like

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,430
that sensation and it's absolutely

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:42,690
overwhelming just this sort of influx

00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:47,520
into your brain this leads to meltdowns

00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:49,600
which can be from too much social

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,190
problems when you've been socializing a

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,330
lot and you can't cope with it or

00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:58,050
sensory input if there's a excess of

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,820
sensory input for a long time you can

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:06,610
completely lose it I'm at the level that

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,160
when I completely lose it I'm often

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,060
quite good at hiding the fact that I'm

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:15,640
having a meltdown or of stopping myself

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:17,170
seeing that this is coming predicting it

00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,370
I'm going out okay to pull myself out of

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,410
those environments go for a walk and

00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:23,770
you've wonder off that's fine

00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:26,530
when people at the lower end this can be

00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:33,340
a complete breakdown for hours and hours

00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:36,100
and hours and it ties in with this is

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:39,190
not a medical term but fizzy mind this

00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,380
is my term for what's kind of going on

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:43,680
in your head of this

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,020
with this sort of sensory input flowing

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,220
in constantly and it's just bubbling the

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,150
bubbling and bubbling and you can't

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:57,360
control it you can't rest you can't

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:59,010
manage it or deal with it and also this

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,990
isn't something that's in the official

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,900
definition of autism but it's something

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:06,060
I have massively noticed in my dealing

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:10,650
with fellow autistic people that I've

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:13,740
started to me is stubbornness and a

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:17,990
willingness to sort of be completely

00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:20,820
unreasonable about things because

00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,950
arbitrary reasons you know it's whatever

00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:25,920
it is that you've decided is your way of

00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:32,730
doing something you will stick and fight

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:36,750
to that it also has lots of correlations

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:39,750
and what they call comorbidities there

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:43,710
seems to be a cluster around ad and ad D

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:48,230
and ADHD to the extent that these may

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:51,330
even be different aspects of the same

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,490
condition not not a lot is known about

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,970
sort of where autism comes from it's

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:59,670
from it is defined from a symptomatic

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,140
point of view so it could even be that

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,320
there are multiple conditions which all

00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:07,170
cause the same symptoms and then but

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,810
around dyslexia dyscalculia dyspraxia ad

00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,640
D ADHD autism there seems to be a

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,680
clustering around them if you have one

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:20,340
you're much more likely to have another

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:25,920
I have dyslexia as well happens insomnia

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,970
is really common in autism and one of

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,140
the greatest benefits have been

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,800
diagnosed as autistic

00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:34,740
oh okay mind Samia that I've had for so

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,300
many years turns out actually these

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,400
things I can do with it I'm simply just

00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,320
sleeping with a blindfold on and we have

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:44,120
an eye mask something like that block

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:48,030
out all sensory all visual sensory input

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,830
has massive effect and my sleep has gone

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,830
from I pretty much get good seven to

00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,080
eight hours every night do you think the

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,060
really well about button I must on is

00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,950
it's a signal to yourself you know you

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,720
can't do anything else you can't sort of

00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,220
I'll just read I'll play with my phone I

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,720
think because you're blind for the

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:10,650
moment that's been wonderful low muscle

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,180
tone effects 40% of autistic people this

00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:15,540
isn't just a neurological condition

00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:17,460
there are issues outside of that now

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,100
these may be secondary that are caused

00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,540
by I don't know not exercising listening

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,850
quite that low muscle tone and

00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,850
clumsiness are heavily associated

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,990
alcoholism correlates very highly with

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,140
autism

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,820
I myself drank very heavily consistently

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,120
for about 15 years

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,020
and again one of the benefits of

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,470
realizing that that was a way of coping

00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:46,230
with busy mind insomnia stuff like that

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,420
was you know alcohol it also makes

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:52,320
social interactions a lot easier when

00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:54,420
you have awkwardness you a you're with a

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,540
group of other people who are all drunk

00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:00,560
and you care less about getting things

00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,560
wrong and they care less

00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:08,850
eating disorders particularly anorexia

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:12,810
and bulimia in women correlate highly

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:15,480
with autism and digestive problems in

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,330
general again no one knows why but there

00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,390
are physical symptoms of autism not just

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,880
neurological there's a lot to

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:27,960
neurological differences to interesting

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:29,880
ones autistic people on average have

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:34,050
larger brains than neurotypical people

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:38,550
and even in brains of the same size they

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:42,050
have more neurons and a more connections

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:45,300
between neurons with less large branch

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:47,340
connections throughout the brain so if

00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:50,220
you imagine if this was a street map

00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:53,280
this is like a map of lots of tiny back

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,380
streets and for this is the way I think

00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,910
of it is for thoughts to get from one

00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:01,080
place to another it's a much finer

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,790
journey of lots of tiny back streets you

00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,860
haven't got this simple straightforward

00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:05,640
oh I can take a highway from there to

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,170
there

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,750
everything's always going through these

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,480
tiny sort of roots and at any point it's

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,890
subject to oh I'll go this way I'll go

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,590
that way or things happen like that

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:23,280
benefits there are benefits to being

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:26,670
autistic if I was given the option to

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,320
sort of be neurotypical and just be

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,300
completely normal

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,790
I'd like to do it for a day maybe two

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:39,420
days try it out but no I like Who I am

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,580
anyway but also I like the benefits a

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,810
lot of my success in my career has come

00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:47,430
through the benefits systemizing

00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:50,670
thinking in systems constantly thinking

00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,900
in systems and seeing the system's

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,810
pattern recognition

00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,970
all these things are a common aspect of

00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:00,720
autism to the extent actually you can go

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,880
too far calm thing I do is over

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,170
systemize things including the way I

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:11,340
walk down pavements that I'm looking for

00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:14,340
dualities of slabs triples or bad and I

00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,570
mustn't step on them you over systemize

00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:17,160
even things like that to the extent I

00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:20,130
you know in central London are a bit

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,200
I'll just leap into a different vein of

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:24,480
traffic in order to correctly touch

00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,220
those two slabs because otherwise I'll

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,070
have to do a three over there which you

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,710
know is no good and doesn't make you

00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:35,490
terribly popular repetition and

00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:37,560
obsession aren't definitely there

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:40,320
positives and negatives there on both

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,600
sides if you're obsessed about something

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,510
good or useful that's actually that's

00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,070
really useful and tied in with insomnia

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:49,860
and things like that you know I have in

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:51,510
the past spent insane numbers of hours

00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,050
just focused on building things creating

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,330
things and the repetition is useful in

00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,800
learning I'm happy to repeat things over

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:02,310
and over again until I get them right I

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,510
enjoy trampolining and unlike most of

00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:05,430
the other people there I will happily do

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,740
the same job over and over and over

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:10,650
again for an hour fine tuning it

00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:12,780
perfecting it you know and whereas they

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:14,750
need to keep changing and doing

00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,030
different things all the time

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,910
radical honesty is something I value in

00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:22,720
other or

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:24,880
people and autistic type people if you

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,860
ask an autistic person for their opinion

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,760
on you know that honest feedback on

00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,190
something you've done doesn't think

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,680
about you you better be prepared because

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:38,230
it will be genuinely honest and it will

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:40,540
just I value that and I enjoy talking to

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,190
other autistic people about things like

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,130
that because we're just completely open

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,890
with each other in a work context

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:50,140
sometimes to open don't always know

00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:53,470
which parts of my life I shouldn't be

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:57,190
sharing with my colleagues originality

00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:01,680
of thinking certainly you see in

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:06,550
Asperger's a lot it might just come

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,760
because of a low inability to learn what

00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:12,250
we should be thinking we don't get take

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,810
feedback well from society because we're

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,320
sort of slightly stepped out of it we're

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:20,140
not involving too much we just haven't

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,210
been railroaded into a particular route

00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,920
and therefore we can think of these

00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:30,100
stupid insane things without any checks

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,560
more spare time I read insane amounts of

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,240
books and when I talk to people how do

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,670
you manage to read so much well if you

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,040
don't go out and don't socialize you can

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,840
get loads more time to do stuff you know

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,680
this is actually a benefit it's

00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:46,450
something I'm trying to work back on and

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,190
spend more time socializing and being

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,290
that kind of person actually it's been

00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:52,330
unhealthy for me too bad you have

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:55,530
learned so much I wouldn't have done if

00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:59,680
I had a social life attention to detail

00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:02,020
focus on detail partly we can see things

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,340
it fit it seems like we can see things

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:05,260
that other people can't just because all

00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:07,180
that raw input is coming in and you can

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:09,040
like you can oh look there's a thing

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:11,020
over there and I just temp and that

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,410
people haven't seen it haven't noticed

00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:19,900
it and also I think a literal mindedness

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:21,160
of Khitan they're caring that's there to

00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,520
tell me I've spent too much time on that

00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,529
slide

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,440
this is why my timings a terrible

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,790
because another common thing you see in

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,589
autistic people is just when they

00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,060
started talking they just pours out

00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:34,339
these just sort of splurging this

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,990
torrent of kind of all the thoughts

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:40,670
coming out and I have trouble actually

00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,160
pulling back and only saying smaller

00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:46,910
things there's an archetype of an

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,000
Asperger's person I think this you see

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:54,380
this it tied in well with I felt

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,970
Danielle proceedures talked earlier he

00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,740
was talking about the naive program of

00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:01,760
the naive artist I think that's actually

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:06,430
an Asperger's artist the people who can

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:09,740
stay naive for their entire career and

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:14,180
you see this sort of archetype of the

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:16,100
mad scientist the mad artist sort of in

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,110
fact hands us perjure himself said it

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,930
seems that for success in science over

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:23,240
art a dash of autism is essential I

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:25,420
think there's some degree of truth to

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,910
that and I think that's possibly why

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:32,600
autism exists we have evolved to have

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,399
autism in society it's there for a

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:37,040
reason my suspect that might be the

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,570
reason that one or two people it's

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,430
crippling them to the vast majority of

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,870
people who have it but one or two people

00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:47,149
benefit greatly from it and quite a few

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:49,880
self-made billionaires have Asperger's

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:52,220
Bill Gates Warren Buffett probably does

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:54,680
if you read any biographies of him he

00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:59,029
comes across as Asperger's Ray Dalio

00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:02,149
as well so the workplace bit how does

00:16:59,029 --> 00:17:06,079
this affect the workplace over

00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:09,559
stimulation this is really common in

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,910
open-plan offices and as we're moving

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,010
more and we seem to moving more and more

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:17,449
towards open-plan offices and no

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:19,610
personal offices the flood lights the

00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,670
movement if you've got one of those a

00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:24,589
desk where you're facing onto the open

00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:30,309
plan office this constant shifting

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:33,620
movement is awful noise as well

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:36,290
conversations constantly sort of

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,090
trying to tune out other people's

00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:40,220
conversations and only focus on the

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,510
conversations in your head I find

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,450
particularly difficult I find myself

00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:47,450
listening to everything everyone says in

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:49,910
the office and actually I've just done

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:51,500
is got quite good at listening to other

00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,050
people's conversations while still

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:55,760
working and then just interrupting when

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:02,300
I've noticed that they're wrong about

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:06,620
things smell is one that people kind of

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:10,430
forget about but if if you wear strong

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,220
perfume or strong deodorant

00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,130
that's actually really effects there's

00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,770
one of things I changes I've made it's

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:22,120
been beneficial is unscented washing

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:26,360
powder unscented shampoo unscented

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,500
shower gel things like that and just get

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,480
rid of as much of that sort of

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,220
artificial scents for my life and it's

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,590
had a huge benefit for me unfortunately

00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:38,990
it means I'm now even more sensitive to

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:42,710
the smells of other people and if you if

00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,780
you ever spray deodorant in the office

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,660
place because you're off you know to

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,270
meeting I hate you you know that is and

00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,380
there seem to be people who can't quite

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,900
tell the difference between do

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,560
particularly in gym changing rooms you

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,650
can't tell the difference between

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,720
deodorant and air freshener yeah you

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:04,460
don't need to spray it in a big thing

00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:08,030
around you oh and I think we all know

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,380
headphones are a huge benefit you don't

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,720
have to listen to music if you find

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,250
music distracting noise cancelling

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,230
headphones or just big headphones a

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:19,960
signal that you're doing something and

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,960
be block out lots of annoying noise

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:32,090
resting whatever face so I might default

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:37,700
face turn fairly or steer slightly sort

00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:39,170
of not welcoming I didn't know that when

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,410
you make eye contact with someone and

00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:45,040
they if you don't smile or respond

00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:48,340
that's actually quite aggressive

00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,720
39 years whenever someone I made eye

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:54,130
contact with someone I just kept my

00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:56,160
default slightly austere face turns out

00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:00,070
people thought I was deeply arrogant

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,120
aggressive you know had its benefit

00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,610
apparently I came across as quite a

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,940
powerful person in the office because of

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,330
this I've now got okay right so when I

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,790
make eye contact with people I need to

00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:16,410
smile or react in some way to the fact

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:18,820
that we've made eye contact I'm still

00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,500
learning try and turn that into a habit

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,320
I'm learning to do that and actually I

00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:26,290
have to constantly be in my conscious

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,020
mode of thinking about Who am I making

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,850
eye contact with am i doing the right

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,290
facial expression and also trying to

00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,150
make it genuine because if I'm

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:35,820
concentrating on too much on that I can

00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:39,940
actually do really stupid smiles which

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:44,680
makes people think I mean makes people

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:47,260
think I'm autistic so in the workplace

00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,940
and one thing I found from this is okay

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,280
all right so I'm actively practicing

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,780
correctly smiling at people making art I

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,580
make eye contact some smile at them I

00:20:52,780 --> 00:21:00,100
get nothing in response they've got this

00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:03,850
stony face and then went oh no no that

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,640
was me six months ago yeah maybe the

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:10,200
person who isn't responding to you or

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:13,150
who seems or steer for who seems

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,800
powerful but distant is a t just

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,320
autistic and they don't know any better

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:24,870
and they don't know how to come forward

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:27,070
and come out of this so in the workplace

00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,750
one thing I'm trying to do is also

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:31,540
forgive other people who aren't

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:34,690
correctly being as friendly to me as I

00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,540
feel they should don't for socializing

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:39,460
in the workplace it's great that it

00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,350
happens I'm perfectly happy for you to

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,330
go off and socialize as a group I don't

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,340
need to be part of that sometimes I

00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,400
might try and come along sometimes I

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,720
won't I actually quite like socializing

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,380
one-on-one I will go out for lunches

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:56,380
with my colleagues on a one-to-one basis

00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,789
and that's great I don't like group

00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:02,979
situations and I

00:21:57,789 --> 00:22:06,039
don't like stupid socializing where

00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:09,759
you're doing something pointless just

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,879
for the sake of everyone kind of sharing

00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:17,769
meaningless conversation I like to have

00:22:11,879 --> 00:22:21,519
serious conversations about a topic try

00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:22,899
to tolerate meltdowns not just autistic

00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,409
people have them other people have them

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:28,779
we don't need to turn into a whole issue

00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:30,999
that like if someone has a genuine

00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:33,070
breakdown it doesn't have to be

00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:35,229
something that is then analyzed than

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:38,979
anyone feels sorry about or awkward

00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:41,649
about equally if someone rose up in

00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:44,229
anger because that might just be because

00:22:41,649 --> 00:22:45,549
of sensory issues throughout the day

00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:48,309
just let it go

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:51,519
and certainly if they are autistic or of

00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:54,369
that type it will just sort of go away

00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:56,649
an hour later nothing you know it's fine

00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:58,960
you know you can have an a massive

00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:02,669
argument blazing around with someone and

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,669
then it goes away and it's fine Oh

00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:08,470
tsking people are less like to be

00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:10,210
mentored they're less likely to come

00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,190
forward and ask for help and this isn't

00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:18,399
just autistic they're also shy people as

00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:20,259
well but bear-like I'd never and again

00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:24,669
this was something Danielle was talking

00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:27,009
about earlier that you get these people

00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:29,440
who have been autodidactic for in my

00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:32,590
case 12 years of programming with no

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,849
real mentoring or guidance from anyone

00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:39,099
else so I've developed a very

00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:42,159
idiosyncratic style by coincidence it's

00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:48,009
a very good style but it's my own very

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:52,389
idiosyncratic one work patterns

00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:54,369
I won't go running out of time but I

00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:56,229
won't go into this too deeply but the

00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:57,940
future is scary and the unknown is scary

00:23:56,229 --> 00:24:01,840
particularly when you know you're going

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,029
to struggle adapting to it I travel and

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,980
camp out wonderful any anything like

00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:07,210
that where you can see the future you

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,739
can see this is this is what the next

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,999
few weeks is going to be like this is

00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,690
what I'm gonna do I just have to work

00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:13,390
through

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:14,860
a list of things someone is juggling

00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,900
that thinking about that and I can just

00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:18,220
sit down and concentrate and do this

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,400
ticket this ticket this ticket this

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:23,200
ticket now prefiguring change if you're

00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,700
moving offices if you're going to change

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,500
the codebase if you're going to change

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,480
libraries change language anything like

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,010
that just coming in one day and going

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,790
right

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,190
everything has now changed we're doing

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:35,050
things differently you will get people

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,270
you will certainly get autistic people

00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:39,610
fighting you just on principle

00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,650
yeah they may even want the change but

00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:44,380
they don't want sudden change that they

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:47,320
can't control just pre figure it over a

00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:52,930
series of time leading up to it and it's

00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:56,620
all much easier meetings don't expect

00:24:52,930 --> 00:25:01,420
people to speak up yeah

00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:04,150
I particularly noticed this in engineer

00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,970
business meetings where there's both

00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:09,400
sets of people there and the engineers

00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,800
would just be silent or when we have

00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:14,350
retros yeah we had mixed retros there

00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,310
was commercial people and engineers

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:21,130
engineers had massive problems they were

00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:22,240
so there's such a culture clash and they

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,500
were they were really upsetting they're

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,420
angry I had all these issues but they

00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,040
wouldn't speak in retro and the

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:30,970
commercial guys it was just all them

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,600
talking they were very much at the not

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:37,390
at all autistic end of that spectrum and

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:40,450
they dominate that you need to actively

00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:43,420
manage discussions and the other problem

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:46,420
being when autistic people do get to

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,440
speak in those meetings you know someone

00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,730
said well you know what do you think

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,550
like me

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,780
they just spew out you know tons and

00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,070
tons of information and won't know when

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:55,390
to stop and can just keep talking and

00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:00,100
talking and you need to actively manage

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:04,020
that and shut people up sometimes all

00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:06,490
meetings benefit from conscious active

00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:09,370
management of the discussion rather than

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,140
just letting this sort of Amorphis leaf

00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:16,060
flow because then you only get stuff

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:20,080
from the confident people who you know

00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:21,820
are all agreeing with each other as

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,520
opposed to people with these new ideas

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,200
things

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,820
so in general I'm there's lots of things

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,490
I can see we can change we can improve I

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:38,710
think they will help everyone I don't

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:41,020
think less noise less smell is going to

00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:43,450
be a problem for anyone it will benefit

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,890
everyone in the office I'm particularly

00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,450
interested in it from the point of view

00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:50,440
of autism but I think it's good for

00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:52,960
anyone I think managing meetings is good

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,960
for everyone in the workplace and I

00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:01,150
think the stem environment engineering

00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:06,370
science skews towards autism so I think

00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:08,980
it can help this environment more that's

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:11,620
it please give me feedback I love

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:13,960
feedback I'd prefer negative feedback to

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:17,080
no feedback please ask me questions I

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,770
want to try and make no more noise by

00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,080
this and do more talks if you know of

00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:27,669
anywhere where I can try and talk I

00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:30,580
would love to and oh hopefully I will

00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:34,270
actually stop blogging and talking more

00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:37,120
about autism with inner sectors my first

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,920
little foray into it thank you thank you

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:45,690
very much
