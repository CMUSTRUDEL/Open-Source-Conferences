	reno: A New Way to Manage Release Notes
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Moorfoot]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Doug Hellmann

reno is a tool for managing release notes in projects that support multiple branches of development, and releases, simultaneously. It solves the problem of managing release notes within patches that fix bugs, and makes it easier to cherry-pick changes between branches (allowing backports or forward ports). This talk will cover the requirements, and constraints, that led us to design and build reno. I will also show how to use it to create notes and publish them in your packages and via Sphinx-based documentation. Then I will talk about the impact reno, and the release notes publishing automation, had on our project and release processes.
