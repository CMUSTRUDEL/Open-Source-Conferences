By Franziska Schropp

Engineers are rare, jobs are plenty, so far so good. But what if I don’t just want any job that pays the bills, but the job that will push my career and that I actually enjoy doing every day? If your answer to why you’d like to join company XY is: “Work from home and make good money”, you should not be surprised to not be taken into the next round. But what would be a good answer to that question? What should I say when asked where I see myself in 5 years? There are a lot of subtle aspects to succeeding and failing in the application process, from your initial cover letter to the on site visit meeting the team.  As a tech recruiter, I’d like to share with you the best and (sometimes quite entertaining) worst practices in the application process in order to help you get the job you want!
