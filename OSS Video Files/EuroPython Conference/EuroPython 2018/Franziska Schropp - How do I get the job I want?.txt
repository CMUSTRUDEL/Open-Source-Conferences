	How do I get the job I want?
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - PyCharm [PyData]]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Franziska Schropp

Engineers are rare, jobs are plenty, so far so good. But what if I don’t just want any job that pays the bills, but the job that will push my career and that I actually enjoy doing every day? If your answer to why you’d like to join company XY is: “Work from home and make good money”, you should not be surprised to not be taken into the next round. But what would be a good answer to that question? What should I say when asked where I see myself in 5 years? There are a lot of subtle aspects to succeeding and failing in the application process, from your initial cover letter to the on site visit meeting the team.  As a tech recruiter, I’d like to share with you the best and (sometimes quite entertaining) worst practices in the application process in order to help you get the job you want!

[Applause]

00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:07,379
hello there's actually quite a lot of

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:09,929
people here more than I expected for

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,759
this very non-technical talk on this

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:13,320
Europe Ison so I guess as some of you

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,059
just were too lazy to leave because they

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,550
had a lot of whiskey yesterday so you're

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,449
welcome to stay and maybe you'll learn

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:24,330
some things so I have to mind the timing

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,180
a little bit and I hope I can convey you

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,519
some new things and some tips and tricks

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,679
to how do you get the job I want so I

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,910
suppose that some of you are maybe right

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,469
now looking for a new job

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,960
or maybe at some point in your career

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:42,809
sooner or later we'll have to be on the

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:45,030
job hunt and if your main motivation is

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,559
something like this you just want a job

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,350
and not starve to death I think

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,760
especially as an engineer or a scientist

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,550
you will have very good chances to find

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,840
at least something that pays the bills

00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,899
but what if you actually want a job that

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,579
you enjoy doing and that also gets you

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,989
somewhere and that you like to go and to

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,570
work every day then I can tell you a

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:10,229
little bit more how to get that job and

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,689
you might wonder who the hell am I to

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,750
tell you I just won't wait until the

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:19,470
newcomers arrive my name is Francisco or

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,790
Francie or funny so my actual you might

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,640
wonder a little bit about that my actual

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:26,009
name is Francisca my nick name is

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,530
Francie so my friends and my family is

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,100
calling me Francie and as I applied for

00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:34,740
trust you we had a HR team of one that

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,479
girl happens to be named francium so two

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,150
friends isn't a team of two people was a

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,189
bit awkward that's why I introduced the

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,619
name funny and I'm very aware especially

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,750
in this country that this name is a

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:46,950
little bit controversial but I was

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,079
thinking they're also people called ich

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,850
so I think it's just great to have a

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,470
female version of this if there's any

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,259
one cultic I think you would make a

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,290
great team let me know so you can call

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,579
me any of those three names and I'm

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,960
speaking beginner this is the second

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,270
talk I ever get to hold at a conference

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,790
so I'm very excited to be here and that

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,240
so many of you are here to listen to me

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,489
today

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,739
and I'm also a beginner in Python so I'm

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,819
learning right now a little bit but I'm

00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,640
not an engineer

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:19,750
I work in HR and I'm here this

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,370
conference to recruit people and I

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,629
handed in a talk and I was thinking I

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,569
might share a little bit of knowledge

00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:28,659
with you to how to get to how getting

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:30,519
the job that you would like to have all

00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,959
right I am a recruiter for three and a

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,000
half years and I specialize in tech

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,400
recruiting so this is pretty much what I

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,390
do every day

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,069
despite also doing the payroll but

00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:43,870
that's less sexy so not talking about

00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:47,439
that so my dream job was being a chicken

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:50,889
nugget scientists as a kid I'm kidding

00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:53,829
it's still my dream job I never got to

00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:55,620
the point so maybe you will think a

00:02:53,829 --> 00:03:01,209
little bit about what your dream job is

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:03,819
and I hope that I can get you some tips

00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,459
for that so we will start this journey

00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:07,930
at the point where you already found the

00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:09,909
job you want to apply first so we're not

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:11,439
talking about how to find a job there

00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:13,720
are a lot of portals out there I guess

00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,310
the majority of you knows where to find

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,810
good jobs it's also very country

00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,370
specific so we will start our journey

00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:19,479
today at the point where you will

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:23,769
actually have to send out an application

00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:25,959
and some of you might think oh she's an

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:28,479
application form once I had to fill out

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,150
one hour long of psychological

00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,609
intelligence test for an internship that

00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,319
was really not cool but if you want to

00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,579
get the job you will not get around the

00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:40,180
point where you have to fill out an

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:43,900
application form but first things first

00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,659
I want to walk you through a little bit

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,349
through that typical application process

00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,569
structure that you have it's probably

00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,889
similar in every company that you apply

00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:56,919
through this is the process that we have

00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:58,599
entrust you did I mention that I also

00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,040
work for trust you it's every promise

00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,409
it's not a commercial session here we

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,090
just happen to be Elisaveta and I after

00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:06,069
one each other so this is not about

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,919
trust you this is about recruiting in

00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:10,629
general but normally you will have to

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:12,790
fill out an initial application at some

00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,530
point of course either Wireless in

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,750
famous application form or you will have

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,000
to send an email or you just can apply

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,669
via LinkedIn so you will have to apply

00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,830
at some point right and normally when

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:26,500
you apply for a tech job there will be a

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,300
technical test very likely

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,840
you will at some point encounter one of

00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,820
us the HR people that's also very likely

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,320
that will happen to you and normally you

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,100
also have a check screening at some

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:42,070
point and also very likely you will be

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:44,160
invited to an on-site visit so I wanted

00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:48,040
to give you a little bit of an overview

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:51,340
how likely it is that you get to which

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,100
step so the initial application about

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:57,220
70% of applications are filtered out

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,990
already and when it comes to the

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,960
technical test that we send out for

00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:04,360
example you will have about 60% of

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,800
application filtered out so from the 70%

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,540
right the ones that are staying and that

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,800
then again 60% think I I know math I

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,550
should have a little bit more in that

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,690
subject but so once you manage to go

00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,760
through the technical test you get

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,160
accepted you will encounter the infamous

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,500
HR people like me and we filter out

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:27,250
about 50% of you sorry

00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,900
and then you will encounter one person

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,970
of the department probably or more aware

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,620
again about 30% of people will be

00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,680
filtered out and through the on-site

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,390
visit you will have so about 20% and not

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
will make it that will not make it

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:44,560
grammar all right just to give you a

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,870
little bit of a context so maybe some of

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,400
you think that well sure my I just got

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:50,410
to attach my LinkedIn profile should be

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,630
fine right or just I can send an email

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,770
send a link with my LinkedIn profile I

00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:58,540
think that should be fine maybe not

00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,919
again actually we counted this the

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,900
percentage that gets filtered out so

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,210
these are two actual jobs that we hadn't

00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,800
trust you the first one is the data

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:08,020
engineering job the second one a

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,530
full-stack role and you can see that

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:16,000
from 434 candidates we ended up hiring 2

00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:19,030
or respectively 570 candidates we ended

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,430
up hiring two so you're not one out of

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:27,370
ten you might probably end up being one

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:29,620
out of hundreds so I advise you to put a

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,210
little bit of an effort in it so your

00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:34,599
LinkedIn profile might not actually be

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:37,320
enough so it can work of course so in

00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:39,460
general today I'm giving you more of a

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,380
sort of say a mean

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,120
of how things can happen like how it's

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,410
very likely to happen of course you can

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,210
you encounter different people you

00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,889
encounter different companies you might

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:49,180
very likely encounter a company that

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,550
says ok I just need your LinkedIn

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,319
profile that's fine but I think it's

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:57,190
always best to be on the safe side and

00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,870
just assume it won't be enough so even

00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:01,419
if you have this one click apply' thing

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,860
or LinkedIn I would if I were you and I

00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:05,289
would do it myself and I would ever look

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,539
for a new job never of course if I might

00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:10,240
that you will look for ways to

00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:12,250
distinguish yourself so for example find

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,750
out the contact person are linked and

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,330
that's responsible for the job send an

00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,590
email or send an email to them because

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,990
you will probably find an email address

00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:22,780
somewhere on the company website suggest

00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:25,300
that they have seen you already a little

00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,690
bit more than just one out of this 500

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:31,840
LinkedIn profiles they will be getting I

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:33,610
advise it to generally attach a CV this

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,259
is a controversial topic probably some

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,300
of you might say well CV years but

00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,310
outdated right I have the data I have my

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,470
psych overflow I have my LinkedIn why do

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,240
I need to put effort in a CV it's very

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,130
likely the company still require it and

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,960
it creates much less noise than just a

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,909
LinkedIn profile so if I look a LinkedIn

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,560
profile look at a LinkedIn profile I

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:53,050
will see a lot of other people I would

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,669
have to log into LinkedIn it's just very

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:56,530
convenient to have a well structured

00:07:54,669 --> 00:08:00,909
nice CV to get out the data that we need

00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:03,210
to have from you and to give you a

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,710
little tips about the creation of the CV

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:08,380
keep it short but informative I'm

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,860
encountering CDs that are five pages

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:15,460
long in block form we do not go to read

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,130
it sorry but it's we don't have the time

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:20,830
to read through five pages of CV so I

00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,930
would say that more than two pages are

00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,610
already a bit critical so if you're a

00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,469
data scientist for example and you want

00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,699
to attach your publications I think it

00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:30,159
makes sense to attach it in the third

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:34,240
page but in general your two pages

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:35,800
should be fine and what's a really nice

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,270
thing about having a CV is that you can

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,149
adapt it to the company you want to

00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,829
apply for so you can maybe emphasize a

00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:43,659
little bit more machine learning or

00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:46,690
emphasize a bit more Python depending on

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:48,730
the job requirements pay attention to

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,550
the visuals if you're applying as a UX

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,820
designer then this should have really a

00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,200
lot more gravity

00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,210
but also if you're applying for as a

00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,920
full tech engineer please pay attention

00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,710
it looks somewhat nice it doesn't have

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,720
to be crazy fancy super nice-looking CV

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,410
but at least somewhat orderly and easily

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,890
readable and this should be common sense

00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:11,270
but please have a proof read it's not

00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,490
that common sense than you might think

00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:15,530
so spelling mistakes a lot of spelling

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,330
mistakes in the CV are really or not

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:20,690
that's painting out the grade of a

00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:23,450
picture and also in advice I would give

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,920
you to list your side projects so not

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,390
just what you have been doing at work at

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,710
your previous employer yet cetera but

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,320
also something that you might have done

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,460
on the side maybe you created an app

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,200
maybe you are contributing to open

00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,610
source mention that because it paints a

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,420
very good picture of you being a commode

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,980
evade it and yeah cool person also in

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:44,240
speaking of motivation I will repeat

00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:45,800
that a couple of times find a way to

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,110
state your motivation just a little bit

00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,790
of well I have looked up your company

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:51,680
online it looks like a nice place to

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,690
work because I like this and this and

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,050
I'm also raised in in our case would be

00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,340
for example NLP and and machine learning

00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,410
I would like to work for your company

00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,600
looks interesting that's enough you

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:04,820
don't have to write again five pages I

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,800
have it with a number five five pages of

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,830
your your life story in there but just a

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,730
little sentence on why this particular

00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:15,020
job caught your eye all right and it's

00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:20,450
always good to inform yourself of the

00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:23,180
company so I would like to give you a

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:25,550
little bit of a worst case practice here

00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:28,210
this is our application form that you

00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:30,770
will encounter if you apply to trust you

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:34,910
so that guy or girl who ever applied

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,900
there probably likes adventures but you

00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,340
also doesn't know what she doesn't

00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,640
really think about why they're the right

00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:44,720
candidate for the position so we did not

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,640
proceed to the next round here I was not

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,150
100% convinced of that person's

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,550
motivation

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:53,990
I wonder wife might be too judgmental

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,110
but I also have a very good example of

00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:01,610
someone filling in this question why

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,690
they want to join us so something that I

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,160
would like to mention in the job

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:06,480
descriptions that we're having we have

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,030
exactly this I love Python with a little

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,860
and a person obviously read the Job

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:12,870
Description picked up the I love pison

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,700
thingy and adapted it and also we are

00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,260
writing there that your ideas will be

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,860
heard and implemented and this person

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,880
picked up this as well and they also say

00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,350
that why they think there would be a

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,820
good candidate for the position and what

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,340
they're passionate about in case you are

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,680
here who wrote this I didn't get back to

00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,230
you yet I will I'm sorry approached me

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,410
outside but this is a very good example

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,030
for yeah just a little bit of effort to

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,740
save you motivation so you can see this

00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:42,990
didn't probably take three hours but

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:45,930
it's just a little bit right so there

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:49,080
will also be a test probably we using

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,880
qualified just to give you a little hint

00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,330
of what might coming up to you when it

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,980
comes to coding tests coding tasks that

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,450
you will have to solve before someone

00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,210
will actually speak to you or a later

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:01,620
point depending on the company's process

00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,330
but this is a very nice tool where you

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,470
will have a cup of coding questions they

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:09,870
run unit tests right through your code

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,970
you can say that like this and there's

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:13,590
also a time tracker so the percentile

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,880
you can see is the the time they spend

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,070
on it this is also not a very good

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,690
example cuz yep first and gave up at

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:24,900
some point normally these tests should

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:26,700
take around an hour alright so you walk

00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:30,120
through the effort of creating a nice

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,890
application uploading your CV no

00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,720
spelling mistakes in your CV M and you

00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,310
stayed a little bit of your motivation

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,290
so far so good

00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:39,240
you might consider you for the next

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,580
rounds if you like adventures you guess

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,960
maybe not but if you're really

00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:47,450
passionate about adventurous then yes

00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,450
and you will encounter the HR screening

00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,300
yeah nobody ever gets this question

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,860
really well but don't worry so yeah just

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,590
don't say like oh I really work a lot

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,720
like work/life balance I have a great

00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:01,830
weakness I work all the time I really

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,120
want to work on this please don't say

00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,210
that nobody will believe you that's the

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,980
thing but what is the HR interview

00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,210
actually for you might want to tease

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,740
well I do have to bother with these

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,980
people we actually sometimes really nice

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,280
people but besides that it's really

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:20,250
about finding out if expectations match

00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:22,050
so it's really more about what you want

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,180
what do we want is it a good match

00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,130
because for example in terms of

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,590
seniority right you can see if this is a

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,330
good match already again we want to find

00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:33,000
out your motivation we want to check if

00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:34,380
this is a cultural fit and in this case

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,640
I'm really not talking about do I want

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,130
to hang out with a person having a

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,140
whiskey which also plays a part but it's

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,060
more are you more of a corporate person

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,190
a start-up person do you like structures

00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,020
are you fine with wearing many hats like

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,870
what's the the kind of corporate income

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,860
Pinilla environment atmosphere that you

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,750
would like to work in and this is

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,720
something that we can offer him it makes

00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:56,490
no sense to really like structures and

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,980
really like processes ending up in a

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,500
start-up so it makes sense to kind of

00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,830
clarify this beforehand we can check for

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:07,140
relevant experience we can that's

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:10,110
something people that don't trust the

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,730
age of people and it's also to already

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:13,680
check salary expectation because it's

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,150
this differs a lot it makes no sense to

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,770
continue for both sides we don't want to

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,240
steal your time but we also don't want

00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:22,350
to invest time if this just won't be a

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,870
match all right I will give you a bit of

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:26,610
an overview about zones please don't

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,620
assume we have no technical knowledge at

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,080
all this is an extra thing that someone

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,410
once said to me in an interview when I

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:36,750
was asking if the person has any further

00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:39,830
questions he's he said in this case it

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,580
was a year not and she thinks he said I

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:44,100
really don't think there's anything that

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:45,540
you could answer me it was like well you

00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,280
will not get the chance to actually ask

00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:51,360
anyone else in our company any questions

00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,040
so tough luck but that that obviously

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
went bad but also a lot of people tend

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,280
to say well I'm not sure if you're the

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,110
right person to ask this or I'm not sure

00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,300
if you know this which is okay it's

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,850
totally not a reason to kick anyone out

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,070
of the process but it's better to just

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,420
not assume that we have no technical

00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,580
knowledge because for example I really

00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:10,020
try it to like learn some coding through

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:12,140
in the language and I'm very interested

00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,520
in the subject and I do know some things

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,980
so it makes sense to just skip the very

00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,420
technical questions right away and you

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,050
can ask the high-level questions if we

00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,910
don't know we will tell you very

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:25,560
difficult is also talking nonstop

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,700
especially product managers tend to do

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,090
that for reason no offense no offense

00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,680
but they do versus one-word answers it's

00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,379
also a bit of a drag if we have to drag

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,239
out every word of you out of

00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:38,029
you but also if you cannot actually ever

00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:38,689
ask any questions so both of this that

00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:42,189
should be right

00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:44,779
medium same with constantly interrupting

00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:46,279
please don't talk very badly about your

00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:47,929
previous employer I had someone saying

00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,579
was well these guys are so dumb so dumb

00:15:47,929 --> 00:15:51,739
like this is the most stupid company

00:15:49,579 --> 00:15:54,139
everyone's like oh my god please don't

00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:56,779
say that you can be honest but don't be

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,759
rude and also tricky is to show that

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,199
relocation is the only motivation so if

00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:01,309
the entire interview consists of how

00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,459
much you would like to relocate to

00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:06,169
Germany or Munich in our case mmm-hmm

00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,970
it's good to mention it but maybe

00:16:06,169 --> 00:16:12,319
shouldn't be the the main motivation

00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:13,059
even though if it is just lie comes to

00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:18,769
the next point

00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:20,899
don't be obviously dishonest if you say

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,209
like my my colleague likes to ask the

00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:24,559
question what have you been criticized

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:27,079
for in the past and if you say well I

00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:31,279
have never been criticized for anything

00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:33,229
that is not true probably I mean and if

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,579
it's true then that's tough luck for you

00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:37,579
because we will never believe that's

00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:41,869
true so it makes no sense being very

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:43,339
obviously not honest be honest you can

00:16:41,869 --> 00:16:46,069
see this talk follows a lot of good

00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:48,229
structure right so please be honest we

00:16:46,069 --> 00:16:50,179
want a mutual match so it makes no sense

00:16:48,229 --> 00:16:52,609
to come up with something that's not

00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:55,309
true or choose just say yes I totally

00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:57,199
love structures I like really strong

00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:59,299
hierarchies that's truly my thing if you

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,579
will be unhappy we won't be happy either

00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:03,949
so it makes sense to really this is the

00:17:01,579 --> 00:17:07,129
main message I want to give you actually

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:09,139
for this talk know what you want make

00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:10,399
really be sure that you know what it is

00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:12,649
that you want and what it is what you

00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:14,569
don't want because it helps no one if

00:17:12,649 --> 00:17:16,069
you come into a company and it's just

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:18,500
not a match at all and you will be

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:20,629
leaving after two months so make sure to

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,819
also communicate what it is that you

00:17:20,629 --> 00:17:24,949
want if you're want to be in a dynamic

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,049
environment if you want to wear many

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,230
hats but if you also find with frequent

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:32,870
changes with some sort of uncertainty

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,639
then it's fine just communicate it and

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,779
if it's the case is the other way around

00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:40,070
also communicated again show interest

00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:44,809
and motivation for the company you're

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:46,429
applying to and very important is to

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:47,030
prepare some questions beforehand it

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:48,410
paints a

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,750
negative picture if you have no

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,790
questions at all and if you actually

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,300
have all your questions answered in the

00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,950
process that's perfectly fine just say

00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,090
that something like well I had listened

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,830
this question prepared but you already

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:03,980
answered it in your explanation of the

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,630
company of the team etc so I have no

00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,310
further questions that's fine but then

00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,780
the recruiter knows ok you prepared a

00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:12,590
little bit and you had some questions in

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:14,360
pattern it's also for you very good to

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,520
eliminate those no goals that you might

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,690
have in mind that's what you don't want

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:23,540
right so you could ask so how you could

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,190
ask for example about the roadmap like

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,840
how would the company create the product

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,160
roadmap and you can see if they if they

00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,080
have a three year plan if they have a

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,730
ten year plan about the vision of the

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,530
company like these kind of things that

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,450
will show you how frequently they change

00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,670
like if they have a good plan if it's a

00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,620
stable company so just make sure to

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:42,140
prepare those questions and prepare an

00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,270
informed salary expectation that's a

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,890
reasonable salary expectation it's fine

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:48,020
to be a bit ambitious with the salary

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,270
but it helps no one if it's completely

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,680
out of hands because then something like

00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,720
this could happen that they say well

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,490
okay we have these three great

00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,410
candidates this one is really really

00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:59,540
good but it's it's really the salary

00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:01,790
expectations is really high so we will

00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,980
settle settle we will take the one with

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,000
a less high salary expectation so it

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,320
makes sense to inform yourself on

00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,690
glasstor etcetera and come up with a

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,220
reasonable number and don't be afraid to

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:14,000
write a follow-up email if the response

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:17,480
takes some time all right I know that I

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,920
am checking my timers so I have to walk

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,060
a little faster I could have you I could

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,710
tell you so many more tips and tricks

00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,240
but twenty five minutes is actually

00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,280
really short yesterday it took me almost

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,860
45 minutes walking through my talk so I

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,620
had to cut a little bit them things I

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:32,540
would like to tell you who of you knows

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,980
this though hands up if you know the

00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:37,190
scene if you know what it about nice

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,350
okay not Eric you're a Python Python

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,670
conference right Monty Python had to be

00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,800
this is really funny I wanted to show a

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:46,250
video first but it's very risky showing

00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:47,600
videos and took a long time so if you

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,300
encounter a tech screening like this

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,700
leave don't don't work there just do the

00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,310
hint if you don't know this is this

00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:57,740
Monty Python case some people who didn't

00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:59,330
raise their hands and just Google

00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:02,140
interview Monty Python you will find us

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,140
and it's very very funny

00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,650
alright there's a couple of tips that

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,770
our review of engineering actually

00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:10,300
prepared for me so it makes sense to try

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,380
to find out of the tech stack of the

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,270
company beforehand you can ask a

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:19,000
recruiter in the previous interview we

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,440
might know so at least we can read

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,160
through the list that somewhere right so

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:26,320
this should be fine as I mentioned

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,910
before I mentioned some projects that

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,100
you contributed to a like open source

00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,260
project like a private pet project

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,790
anything that could be interesting for

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:37,750
the job and just generally shows that

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:40,210
you're a motivated person also very

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,590
interesting in the tech part is that you

00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:43,060
can collaborate with your team members

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,940
right working in an engineering team

00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:48,090
requires a lot of collaboration with

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,500
your teammates and we want team players

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,570
so it makes sense to prepare a couple

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,000
example where you successfully worked on

00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,290
this and also for you I am sure that you

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,850
all agree with me in staying up to date

00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:00,450
is very very important in the tech

00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,650
industry so I prepare a couple of

00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:04,860
sources where you get your your

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,150
knowledge from for example like blogs

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,210
any books that you've been reading any

00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:12,400
podcasts you're following like yeah any

00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:14,640
forums etc so that makes a very good

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,640
impression

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,390
alright and last but not least you will

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,070
at some point have an on-site visit

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,410
probably except for when you live very

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:28,780
far away it's always tight but you will

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,310
have to talk to people there I'm telling

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,680
you even if talking to people might not

00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:34,570
be your thing and it's also not always

00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,430
my thing which sounds weird working in

00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:37,870
age everybody's - but you will have to

00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:44,110
make an effort to actually talk to

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:44,520
people at this point don't ask just wing

00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,570
it

00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:50,710
if you don't know what the interviews

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:53,020
name is it doesn't matter it's makes

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:54,460
sense though to prepare beforehand which

00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,290
people you will be talking to it - ask

00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,730
the recruiter who will prepare the

00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:59,590
on-site visit for you whom you will be

00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:01,390
speaking with maybe you could even look

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:04,930
them up on Stack Overflow whatever see

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:07,510
what they working on this is something

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,070
that I really shouldn't be telling as an

00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,440
common sense again but please be

00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:12,880
punctual and in case you're running late

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,560
that happens like a coupie flight

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,230
connection

00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,120
train delay it whatever please make sure

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:21,590
to call someone or write an email say

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,300
I'm really sorry I gonna be late

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:25,130
nobody is gonna be mad but if you just

00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,030
show up two hours later the real life

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:31,970
case someone showed up two hours later

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:36,170
bit odd didn't get the job please make

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,580
sure to inform someone also that's not

00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,710
less common sense though but please

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,480
don't show up super early because we

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,100
won't be ready if you show up half an

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,810
hour earlier it will be very awkward for

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:46,730
you sitting somewhere and very awkward

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:49,010
for us having to finish what we are

00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:50,360
doing knowing that you're sitting

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:53,060
somewhere so ten minutes five minutes

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,950
earlier is perfectly fine but if you are

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:57,620
earlier at the premise just walk around

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,560
the building 1 million times less

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,970
awkward than awkwardly sitting somewhere

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,350
it makes sense to ask what to bring if

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:07,820
it's not in the instruction and also

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,260
that's again interact with the team

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,110
because it will probably go for lunch

00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,120
with them you don't have to be super all

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:16,010
over the top with talking non-stop and

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,210
being the most outgoing person ever but

00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,950
make sure to show a little bit of an

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:20,660
interest in your future colleagues and

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,970
listen to the conversations ask some

00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:24,940
questions and mind the companies dress

00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:28,040
code I know that for engineering

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,510
applicants this is normally not super

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,280
important that you don't have to show up

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,830
in a suit normally if you apply in a

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,180
bank you might have to show up in a suit

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:40,400
so check a little bit the company

00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:42,080
culture that you were applying for and

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,780
see you what make sense how to go there

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,210
it's not super important but it just

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:51,280
shows ya again some effort that you

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:53,840
inform yourself and also if you have

00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,430
like a test or a task or something to

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,650
work on you will have a presentation

00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,960
maybe some feedback please react

00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:01,760
appropriately so don't get super

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,710
defensive and be like well I didn't have

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,270
the time to do this or well this was not

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,690
a rightly phrased question even if this

00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,490
is the case make sure to UM take the

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,170
feedback say well okay I will work on

00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:16,940
this the next time just like try to

00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:19,370
react appropriately yeah you have one

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:24,770
minute to sum up all the things sum of

00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:26,300
all the things again motivation it's

00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,080
very important I cannot stress this

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,970
enough

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:31,220
because I have this might be like the

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:33,380
main reason or the majority of people

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,570
that we would reject because it tends

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,580
people come off super unmotivated to

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:39,950
actually join the company or to do the

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,330
job so really make sure that you

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:43,100
showcase a little bit you're interested

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:45,429
in the company and the job both right

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,950
not just the job but also the company

00:24:45,429 --> 00:24:51,019
prepare take it seriously just

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:53,149
confidence is good being overly

00:24:51,019 --> 00:24:55,899
confident walking in like everybody was

00:24:53,149 --> 00:24:57,799
just waiting is a little bit tricky

00:24:55,899 --> 00:25:00,139
exactly don't tip the scale of

00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:02,899
confidence versus arrogance have

00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:04,580
realistic expectations about the job but

00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:06,260
make sure you have the right

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,820
expectations and again and this is the

00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:10,159
message I want to leave you guys with

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,840
today and I hope that you took some

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,669
hints and tricks out of it if you want

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,830
to discuss more I'm happy I'm also

00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:19,519
somewhere around later make sure you're

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:22,610
very aware of what you want and what you

00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:25,399
don't want and adequately be able to

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,340
communicate it alright

00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:31,580
oh my timer is done sorry I don't even

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,929
know what Oh Chris ending if you have

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,010
any questions I think we still have a

00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:36,010
little bit time for questions right

00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:48,360
I have to stay in this thing we have a

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,000
presentation training at our company and

00:25:48,360 --> 00:26:05,340
they say don't stay behind the booth

00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:12,600
sorry Katarina great talk I think it you

00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:15,559
mention in the side projects to put your

00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:21,059
blog you have accounts there cetera I

00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:24,929
didn't mention as side projects or if

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:26,809
you want to do spore dance oh let me see

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:29,760
yeah okay

00:26:26,809 --> 00:26:35,789
that's actually really compliments I

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:38,610
think your behavior so what how much is

00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:40,049
important for you that's a very good

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,750
point actually that I completely

00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,580
neglected but thank you very much

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,100
it is absolutely nice to also write in

00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,289
your CV or mention somewhere your

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,700
hobbies absolutely because it makes it a

00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:52,830
little bit more approachable as a person

00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:54,630
we know a little bit more who you are

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,429
and it can also be very impressive for

00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:58,230
example if you're running marathons

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:00,270
frequently this definitely shows that

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:04,799
you are someone who's capable of

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:06,510
discipline who's yeah like a person that

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,360
has passion and who's following through

00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:11,279
with something so side projects as in in

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,470
interesting stories interesting hobbies

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,809
anything that's not related to work is

00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:18,809
definitely very beneficial to mention

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:19,919
even in the severe already or also in

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:28,500
the on-site visit in the talks

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:30,000
absolutely more questions for me it

00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,760
would be really important the company

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,770
culture and yet you don't actually as a

00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,720
applicant you don't see anyone who works

00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,620
at the company other than HR like the

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,020
people you're going to be working with

00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:43,070
until you've gone through Asia how does

00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:46,460
an applicant assess company culture

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:48,740
that's a really really good question I

00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,840
think on

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:53,330
many companies you can already find out

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,670
a lot on the internet actually for

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,950
example last door we have a lot of

00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,840
reviews on craft store and I think when

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,280
you read through the reviews it actually

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,020
gives you a bit of an idea what it is

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:05,480
they're like what it is like to work

00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:07,490
there or there are also other products

00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,600
like who knew no in Germany where you

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:10,370
can find out what people say about

00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:13,190
review company where people say about

00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:15,200
the company also you might check out the

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:16,700
websites so employer branding is

00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,410
becoming bigger and bigger and normally

00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:20,600
the companies tried to paint a realistic

00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:24,830
picture what it's like it's realistic

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:26,510
but positive but still realistic so it

00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,100
makes sense to check on the internet

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:31,280
what you can find and it also makes

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,840
sense to ask the HR person to explain

00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,330
you a little bit what it is like to work

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,400
at rescue some people ask me Petra

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:41,090
at the company so no recruiting center

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,890
Greek people ask me what I like

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,510
especially about the company and I

00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,400
normally answer very honestly what I

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:49,160
what I personally like a lot so this is

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,450
a question you might ask and ask them to

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,679
explain you a little bit what the

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,150
company culture looks like because it

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,980
also beneficial for them to be honest

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,380
about it as I said since they don't want

00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:02,080
a mismatch I hope that answer your

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,080
question one more question

00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:17,910
yeah exactly like the HR screening would

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,410
normally be the first content you can

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:24,630
ask them there one more question that

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:27,200
was very quick comment so we have one

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,200
more question

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,950
hi thank you so I've been in your

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,410
situation where I've been interviewing

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:40,080
people and one of the questions that

00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:43,020
people have asked me at the end is can

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,060
you give me any feedback oh yeah on the

00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:49,010
spot what do you think of that question

00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:51,420
with an interview process oh yeah yeah

00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:54,360
yes that's a tricky one that's a tricky

00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,000
one you would know probably I think it's

00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,250
it's a good question

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:03,060
it's a good question and it forces the

00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:04,290
interviewers who answer sort of honestly

00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:06,270
I would say at least I try to answer

00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:07,860
very honestly cause it makes no sense to

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,630
say well this was amazing greatest and

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:12,960
if you ever had and then a week later I

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,640
go by the way with lining you so it's I

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,350
think it's a very good question and it

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
gives you the chance to know right away

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,100
where you stand because normally the

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,290
interviewer would give you an honest

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,460
feedback like pack nicely of course or

00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,230
like you and say like that was just

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,150
creepy sorry but you would say that I'm

00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,380
not sure if this is like a very good

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:29,700
match right now I can see you're looking

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,850
for something different but then you

00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,320
already have your answers so um and it

00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:36,840
will never be taken negatively I would

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,090
say so I think it's a good question to

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,890
ask already in the HR screening but also

00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:43,430
for the for the tech screenings I would

00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,830
say especially because you have very

00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,780
technical just like non emotional

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:53,070
feedback because this is like very you

00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:55,790
know straightforward all right I thank

00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,790
our speakers again

00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,220
