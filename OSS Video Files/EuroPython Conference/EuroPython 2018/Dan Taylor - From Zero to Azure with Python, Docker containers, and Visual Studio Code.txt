By Dan Taylor

In this session we will walk through creating a Python web app
with Docker and deploying it to Microsoft Azure using the free,
cross-platform, and open-source Visual Studio Code. We will also show
using hosted Jupyter notebooks in Azure Notebooks to analyze data, and
storing data in CosmosDB using the Azure SDK for Python. If you're
excited about Python and want to learn more about the capabilities of
Azure, then this session is for you. We will cover all of the basics, no
experience with Azure, containers, cloud computing, or Visual Studio
Code necessary!
