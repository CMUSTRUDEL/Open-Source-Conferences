Description: 
	White Mars: living far away from any form of life
[EuroPython 2018 - Keynote - 2018-07-25 - Smarkets]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Marco Buttu

Concordia Station is a French/Italian facility located inside Antarctica, in a plateau called Dome-C, in the middle of nowhere. A dark and cold place: no Sun from May to August, temperatures around -80 Celsius degress, no life. Here I am living and performing scientific research with other 12 collegues from Italy, France and Austria. We are the most isolated people on Earth, more than the austronauts in the International Space Station. There is no way to move from Concordia until November, and no one can come. It is like to live in another planet, and that is why the European Space Agency is interested in making bio-medical research on us, in order to better understand how the human body behaves in a such extraterrestrial environment. We will introduce our studies, describe this place and our life here, and of course also speak about Python.

	00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:15,619
okay then we get to the second keynote

00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:19,090
of Europe - um you ready you're ready as

00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:19,090
well okay yes you ready

00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:28,280
I've one questions out we've been with

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:31,100
Europe - two florins Bilbao and Remini

00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:35,300
and who think is too cold here in

00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:38,300
Edinburgh who think it's too hot in

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,390
Edinburgh I wasn't aware so many locals

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:43,870
around so okay but if you think like

00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,149
twenty-two degrees and editors too cold

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:48,979
let me tell you about some guys in

00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,819
Antarctic are they'd probably have like

00:00:48,979 --> 00:00:54,979
minus 80 degrees Celsius now and we're

00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:56,989
now going live to basically the other

00:00:54,979 --> 00:00:59,839
side of the world you see them already

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:03,829
sitting there they're more isolated than

00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:05,510
the astronauts on the ISS because there

00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,880
is only certain time spots where they

00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,160
actually can leave the Antarctica

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,920
station and they're going to tell you a

00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,470
lot about their work their research team

00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,330
in a bit so please give them a warm

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,330
welcome to Antarctica

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:36,060
I hole I was supposed to be there with

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,390
you also this year but actually I'm a

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,150
little bit far from Europe this as

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,540
Alison told you before is Concordia

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,900
station is the European outpost in

00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,430
Antarctica in the middle of Antarctica

00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:56,520
and it's a French Italian facility and

00:01:52,430 --> 00:02:01,890
twinned a winter season I toss these 13

00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,110
of the people guys and we are yes the

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,760
more isolated on earth more than the

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,220
astronauts the International Space

00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,840
Station because between February and

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,880
November there is no way to move from

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,880
here and no one can come because the

00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,660
temperature is really low it can be

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:25,530
lower than Meuse 80s and the sensors

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,020
degrees and now I want to share a little

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,730
bit of a shot the screen because I want

00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,610
to show you a little bit of slides and

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,610
so we will see in about five minutes

00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:58,110
just a second okay oh it's okay okay

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:07,000
perfect so Concordia is one thousand and

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,520
two hundred kilometer far far from the

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,860
closest based on the cost and there are

00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,490
three point two kilometers of snow and

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:18,970
ice under width there is lack of oxygen

00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:22,090
because the air is rarified as if it's

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:26,380
at 4,000 meters of altitude at normal

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:30,100
attitudes and this ugly dry because this

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:32,800
is the largest desert on earth there is

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,200
no life here except us and the last time

00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:39,730
we saw the Sun was exactly 80 days ago

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,040
Concordia is the most similar place on

00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,860
earth to another plant and that's why

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,320
the European Space Agency is making

00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,990
biological specimens in order to better

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:59,170
understand how the human body behaves in

00:03:49,990 --> 00:04:03,700
such a crystal environment so imagine to

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:06,940
have a continent 1.5 times larger than

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,370
Europe totally covered by from a layer

00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,760
of two kilometers of ice and snow

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:15,730
that's Antarctica the highest continent

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,790
on Earth with an average altitude of two

00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:21,340
kilometers from the sea level

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,730
approximately 61 percent of all

00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:28,150
freshwater the physical potable water

00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:31,540
it's here if you melt Altis eyes the

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:36,550
fresh walk the sea level will everywhere

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:39,370
of eight meters during the Antarctic

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:41,590
winter between February and the total

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:45,100
population of the continent is in or

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:48,520
less the people in Europe also the was

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,680
most of them the cost and a few in the

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,280
middle of the plateau in fact there are

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,150
only three permanent bases in the middle

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,630
of Antarctica

00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:59,230
Concordia base with certain people

00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,410
Vostok base

00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:08,050
managed by Russia certain people as well

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:10,960
and also us a base with 45 people the

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,230
population here is is here in order to

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,080
perform us in research comes I hope this

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:20,560
place will be to pass an exam all the

00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:24,660
rest because it's a huge laboratory for

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:28,030
science nation cooperate peaceful which

00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,500
was the goal you know more about our

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,500
planet and your path

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,600
okay okay

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,280
to have power we use three directors one

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:55,330
generates until 100 kilowatt in 20 and

00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:58,120
150 kilowatt we consume about 5000

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,040
liters of fuel per month and this

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,710
probably is similar to Carolina with

00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:06,850
that it's not that it's freezing

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:10,090
temperature 55 still sousta greece it's

00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,580
stored outside the base and we keep

00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:16,240
about 2 t5

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:25,870
it's always warm in order for them to be

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:28,180
immediately available the fuel and the

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,610
majority of the food comes here

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,870
transported by some catepillar

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,990
like the one we use in the picture and

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:43,570
it's driven by around twelve people it's

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:46,030
a long trip of about fifteen days one

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:48,640
thousand and three hundred meters at the

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:50,950
cost and they usually travel twice a

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:53,560
year exclusively to test procedure of

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:57,060
course because the winter time Concordia

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,060
is a unattainable

00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,689
yeah as I told you before we are here to

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,659
perform scientific research in different

00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:15,270
fields one of them is the straw me and

00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:17,939
that's my duty and we have two

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,250
telescopes observing the sky optical

00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:23,759
frequencies the one we use in the

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:27,090
picture on the Left follows a star for

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,240
all winter because we expect the transit

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:33,539
of apartment we are lucky also some news

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,620
and why is this place so important for

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:40,590
us - because there are no artificial

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:43,949
lights and no humidity and so the sky is

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:46,110
really clear also because we have three

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:51,620
months of darken so we can observe

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,620
Tinsley we can only from space

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:04,020
Python is the most used programming gear

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,360
a program in programming is hard and the

00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,590
contributing to open source project is

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:14,000
almost impossible because we have a 512

00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:16,620
cubic of bandwidth for all the station

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,379
we don't have the internet on our

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:25,319
personal computers and to access the

00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:27,779
network we use a common actor now I show

00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,069
you just a couple of pictures before it

00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,069
was a colleague's

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:47,370
this one is Concordia sunset I pick two

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:53,640
at the beginning of the winter that's

00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:56,000
the last time we saw the Sun in the days

00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,000
ago

00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:11,810
and this one is syrupy under the mode so

00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:15,950
this picture is a beginning of the

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:39,560
winter okay now it's time for clean I

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:42,199
will speak about Eugene so hello

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,230
everybody I'm Colleen as I just told you

00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:48,019
Marco and me I'm a glaciologist here I

00:09:45,230 --> 00:10:05,120
will then speak a little bit about

00:09:48,019 --> 00:10:08,540
mythology and with a PowerPoint okay so

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,940
we're here we static the Suraj here here

00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:13,760
clarity is it cool to better understand

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:16,029
our surrounding climate so in the

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,920
present a bit as well on the past and

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,690
here is a very good environment because

00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,050
we don't have a lot of pollution around

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:28,130
because ACTA Kate it's really desertic

00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:32,449
and because but we are speaking no

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:37,670
matter above the the ice so here on the

00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:38,360
on the cross section you can you can see

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,940
where we are

00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:47,390
so it's naturally okay today's Concordia

00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:49,550
here so it means that we are around what

00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:55,069
we call the high plateau of Antarctica

00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:58,730
and here is a very good realized I start

00:10:55,069 --> 00:11:00,470
really why because as we are on the

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,230
plateau we are almost in the middle of

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:07,220
the ice cap and so there is absolutely

00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:10,160
no velocity so no velocity means that

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,100
the layer of ice are not disturbed going

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,410
on in the depth of

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,860
is very good because but so we have a

00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:21,470
lot of ice you know matter and the

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,340
accumulation of snow equivalent ice is

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:27,830
very very low and we have approximately

00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:36,010
millimeter of ice corresponding to one

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:41,900
year why why we are doing some ice car

00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:43,730
it's it's it's because so I told you I

00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:48,700
we want understand better the climate of

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:52,940
the past so the snow when it's holding

00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:55,970
it it captures some some air and some

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:59,720
particles of the atmosphere after is

00:11:55,970 --> 00:12:04,580
going to compact it and become ice the

00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:11,060
ice is material and so those bubble of

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:12,860
air in so in practical this is what we

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,920
are doing so on the first picture on the

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:20,720
left you see the ice which is into the

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:24,890
drawing instrument just under you see

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,580
ice coming out the Linea instruments and

00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:30,410
on the right this is a section of ice

00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,270
that we analysed and what we analyze on

00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,990
it we don't analyze all the ice but we

00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:40,040
analyze the bubble of air which are in

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:41,480
prison and ice and so as this is my

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,320
accumulation at the beginning if you

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,980
remember in the surface this is a

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,560
present-day Morales whereas at modem or

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,960
you've gone on depth and the more you

00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,320
find information of the past with the

00:12:53,960 --> 00:13:03,830
pickup we dwell first three kilometer

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:05,540
and so we arrive to 800,000 years ago so

00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:08,750
we we arrived to get some information

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:13,940
about a long long time ago so the main

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:16,940
results of this I am and and so main of

00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:20,000
main of I tell you that we analysis

00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:23,360
those ice carpet now we have analyzed

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,570
only one quarter of the ice car and all

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,810
the rest is is the EPA

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:32,510
kept here because the attack is the mr.

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:38,630
pritter the world so why not keep this

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:42,410
here so the main results of PK it's

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:45,290
really what we're talking now in the day

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,780
it's the correlation between a

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,930
temperature the greenhouse is a

00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:54,110
saturation so here on graph you can see

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,950
that when sunfish is the pressure sorry

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,670
is going up

00:13:54,950 --> 00:14:02,090
does she look for example at meeting the

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:06,650
following same train so we could we can

00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:09,230
have a cue spoiler but the consequence

00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:14,720
of the augmentation of house gases the

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:17,240
on the pressure of the atmosphere but we

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,460
wanted there is another project now

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:24,190
running here because I finish in two

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:27,080
thousand five six morales and so want to

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:30,080
perform another drilling yet forty

00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,320
kilometers far from Concordia where I

00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:37,580
think that we can find some ice of 1

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,150
million years ago probably 1.5 million

00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:42,200
years ago

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:44,690
so why yeah we want in the weight is

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,050
interesting on it the project called

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:50,690
beyond the PTA oldest ice and we are

00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:54,430
interested after going to a more than 1

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:59,000
million years Bob because the cycle of

00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:03,770
inter decision until a 1 million years

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:08,270
ago was a cycle of 110,000 years whereas

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:12,020
after what in years ago the cycle are

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:15,350
very moreish shorter and it is like the

00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:18,200
cycle takes moral it's forty thousand

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:22,340
years ago the formation we have a things

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:25,070
to sediment cores or some like

00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:30,920
information of the aqua T of the earth

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:34,100
this kind of parameters so that's why if

00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:37,880
we if we arrive to perfect running after

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,830
1 million years ago and we think that we

00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,470
can have rain from issuing about

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:47,589
by the spirit of lesion become shorter

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:51,320
and there is a valid knowledge achill

00:15:47,589 --> 00:15:55,670
goal and this is the PT a-- was what we

00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:58,880
call the destroyed destroyed ruling it

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,910
means that we put instrument to the ice

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,600
we take the ice bring it up in the face

00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:08,000
then we bring it to Europe and in Europe

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,130
we make the analysis whereas here we

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,240
develop a sword you can see on the

00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:18,410
picture here you have the heating so it

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,720
melts the ice go down and after us we're

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,450
on this tube you have a spectrometer the

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,350
spectrometer is but louis to analyze to

00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:30,470
analyze the debacle of gas basalt past

00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:33,890
position at the atmosphere it's a way

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:37,790
more fast that not the ice core and

00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:42,290
everything and so in normally one year

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:45,459
so in what a stomach pain will perform

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:50,899
all this drilling and so have results on

00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:56,649
the composition of gas so this is the

00:16:50,899 --> 00:16:59,300
new project unfortunately does the

00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:02,510
dwelling it was a huge project are

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,970
performed only summer because the

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,760
problem is that in a winter the rally

00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,559
like i yeah it's more complicated to

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,410
perfect drug because of instantly

00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:15,470
because the electronic inside because

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:22,699
you you have more things to put your

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:24,949
instrument or like stuck on the ice but

00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:28,069
we are still keeping your class your

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,830
twitter but it's more smoke scary so

00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,309
more interface and so you can see for

00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:36,919
example that we are making a wet snow so

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,929
you dig your hole in the snow and you

00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:40,850
take a samples you take on page

00:17:38,929 --> 00:17:42,770
referring to take some physical

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:46,250
properties of did not better in the

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:50,150
climate present climate and climate of

00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:52,400
the past and so of para la zoology I

00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:57,940
will stop here

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,940
thank you thanks

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,100
hello everybody I am sick investor and

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,080
I'm the station leader of the base but

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,410
I'm also glass eulogists but don't worry

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,850
I'm not gonna talk about snow again

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:16,860
because actually less tillage is not my

00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:20,280
background normally I'm a biologist I'm

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,810
doing space biology and well the reason

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,670
why I'm here is not so much from my

00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,230
background intellectually because I've

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,150
been trained specifically for coming

00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,010
here but it's because I've been doing

00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,380
other missions in isolating on compound

00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,880
environments one of which I'm going to

00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:36,380
talk about as soon as we can get our

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,380
computer to work just

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,010
oh yeah it's good

00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:19,309
okay it's coming

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:27,390
okay so the submission I was talking

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,670
about a skull heist is for and it's a

00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,590
mission which is funded by NASA and the

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,750
purpose was to simulate one-year mission

00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,670
and norms and the reason why NASA is

00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,670
funding this program it is because

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,070
and the reason why NASA is phoning his

00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,350
program is because it planned to send

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,809
humans to Mars in the 2030s even though

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,670
the exact plan is not very accurate yet

00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:59,850
but there are still some questions to

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,500
hunter including whether astronauts

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:03,690
after spending months in isolation and

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,429
confinement would still be able to

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:08,370
perform at a high level and would still

00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:10,080
be able to work as a team and to answer

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,710
this question and some others NASA is

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,750
funding a program called high seas

00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,370
basically simulations of missions to

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:20,250
Mars which happen in system here which

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:23,550
is about 11 meters in diameter and which

00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:26,880
is isolating the slope of the moon or of

00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:29,910
the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii and

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,059
their crew of six people spend different

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,130
periods of time going from for four

00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,440
months to one year

00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:39,929
there was one one-year mission and in

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,690
which I took part and they're doing this

00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:44,400
mission the six people leave as if they

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,740
were on Mars which means for instance

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,690
that they don't interact in real time

00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,270
with anybody because the only way to

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,920
talk to people is using emails with the

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,809
delay in 20 minutes in both directions

00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,700
which means that you send an email it

00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:59,040
takes 20 minutes to arrive and then

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,850
after the person has answered text again

00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,980
20 minutes to come back to you so for a

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:06,750
year I have not talked to or seen

00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,850
anybody besides my five crewmates

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,290
another important particularity of this

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,890
is that the crew members and ever

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:15,720
exposed to fresh air or sunlight because

00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:18,750
when they go outside but once or twice a

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,910
week maximum they have some analogs of a

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:27,410
suit which I'm going to show later this

00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,410
is how it looks inside the dome

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:34,440
okay it so this is what it looks inside

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:36,450
season as you can see it's like

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,179
basically looks like a bit like the

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:40,650
Emmys freak movie theaters so it's quite

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,360
quite voluminous it gives an impression

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,730
of space even though the surface is

00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,100
quite small and we are basically one big

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,530
room on the lower floor and then you

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,350
have a mezzanine with some bedrooms

00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:53,970
it's the drawers that you can see and

00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,820
those bedrooms are basically the size of

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:59,250
big closets and there is very very

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,900
little sound insulation

00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,850
which is actually funny because just by

00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,710
listening I could always know where my

00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:06,450
chromatic own words were doing you know

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:11,150
there was very there was a lot of let's

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:14,070
approximate you really had no intimate

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:16,289
as for resources and we were basically

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:18,140
behaving as if you were on Mars and so

00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:20,820
for food for instance we only

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,100
freeze-dried food or mostly freeze-dried

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,510
food I can see some examples here with

00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:26,940
some cubes

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:30,419
Jerald chicken dried cherries red

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,210
vegetable dn't simply because on a trip

00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:36,210
to Mars you would bring some food that

00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:40,049
you can stop or extended birth time and

00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:44,240
we did grow a little bit of fresh food

00:22:40,049 --> 00:22:44,240
using basically what we could find that

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,730
to be true the amounts were quite

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:54,630
limited there you can see our first

00:22:50,730 --> 00:23:00,000
harvest of cherry tomatoes as you can

00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:01,409
see it's not crazy amounts and our

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,570
bathroom and you can see that there is a

00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:05,010
there is a toilet but the toilet since

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,750
we have to spare as much water as

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:09,480
possible as a dry toilet which means

00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:11,250
together you do what you have to do and

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,350
bacteria take care of turning what you

00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,260
produce into some things that smells a

00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:18,539
bit less and water also would be ripped

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,770
as I said well reproduce and you can see

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,530
that we have a shower which would

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,270
require a literary for mass mission but

00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,390
since who are worth saving as much as

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:30,630
possible we're talking about two showers

00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,070
of about 30 seconds each a week and then

00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:36,720
we're collecting the water on using it

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:38,610
for our cleaning the ground what we're

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,350
doing most of the time was research we

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:42,929
all add our own research projects

00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:45,179
because all researchers or engineers or

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:47,220
something approaching which were mostly

00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,980
test subjects here for instance you can

00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,370
see I was taking some some hair samples

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,380
from it of mine which was analyzed for

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:59,820
looking at stress hormones we also gave

00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:03,240
urine samples saliva samples we had

00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,330
questioners we had various tests we

00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,510
tested some technologies for instance

00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:12,210
three little girls to mitigate the

00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:13,170
effect of isolation confinement our

00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:16,860
sleep was may need

00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:19,710
our physical activity was monitored we

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,230
also had time as we called sociometric

00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:24,120
badges which basically some devices that

00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:26,760
were whirring around our necks and out

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,800
we're able to know who we were talking

00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:34,580
to how we were talking to them how close

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:36,960
we were and answering we also had some

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,760
some experiments outside we are for

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,830
instance some collaboration experiments

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,660
where we had some objective that we had

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,720
to reach together and where we

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:48,660
interacted was was there a it we were

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,610
some geology taught to perform in

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,980
recognition that you were doing similar

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,580
work on Mars the working underground

00:24:52,980 --> 00:25:04,860
outside or under the ground in what is

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:08,700
called lava tubes and in addition to

00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,830
that we also add we also had our own

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,840
research projects there I was working

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:17,100
for instance yes that's me when I was

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,110
younger I was Sweden back then and I was

00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,580
working and development technologies

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,160
that could all you to produce what you

00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:26,910
needed Mars from what is already there

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,860
using mic so yeah that's me on that

00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:30,750
mostly why I'm here and here I'm not

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,610
doing but biology simply because what is

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:34,800
it so called outside that you have no

00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,650
plans on emails and even microbes do not

00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:43,470
proliferate so if you find them just

00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:48,290
work by doing divide so that's basically

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,290
why I came here and thanks for Adam

00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:59,810
[Applause]

00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:06,340
hello everyone my name is Moreno

00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:08,500
padishah which the real life I work as

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,990
computer scientist for the Italian

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,850
national research council and here in

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,060
Concordia I cover the position of

00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,710
electro science which basically means

00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:21,690
that I take care of both the outer and

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:24,760
the softer side of data acquisition or

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:26,860
experiments we are conducting here I'm

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,130
responsible for 12 experiment the

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:35,760
physics among which an interrupter

00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:35,760
patapri forces moto G the magnetism and

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:44,320
usually when you think about Antarctica

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:47,680
you see something like you should see a

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:53,100
picture so you should see the continent

00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:58,440
covered by ice and what's important to

00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:58,440
research in this part the word is back

00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,000
it's because the sulfur net miss Emma

00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:07,870
sphere as you can see from the next

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,450
picture is mostly I do ssin say 2

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:14,410
percent is water and the Antarctic 8

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:18,610
staff to cover the south part the planet

00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:20,710
and and the sulfur atmosphere is not as

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,130
densely populated or fur one we have

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:27,460
less observatories be at stations in

00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:30,010
Antarctica is the stream important to as

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:33,240
much as possible observation point and

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:38,830
we have one here for values experiments

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:41,830
and concerning seismology the continent

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:44,710
is clearly on a stateful tectonic plate

00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:47,950
and see in the picture and so it means

00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:51,760
their local events whatever we artistic

00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:55,180
in g-strings is no meters are incident

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,930
at somewhere else in work and so there

00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:03,040
is no much from from activities and our

00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:05,260
station is isolated in winter and

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:09,570
there's no movements or anything that

00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:09,570
can interfere the measurement

00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:17,330
of course earthquakes

00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:20,120
use McQuade that propagates inside nets

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:21,830
and they carry some information due to

00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:24,590
the fact that the propagation is

00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:28,490
affected by nominal like a reflection

00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:31,670
and don't think that resemble refraction

00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,680
at well and there are my facts that are

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:37,540
introduced in the prefecture

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:40,370
it's like detail a changes phase or

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:43,310
polarization activation there are equal

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,920
signs for a know the information is way

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:48,680
it's curve is is a lot of information a

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:50,780
lot of insight about the inner part of

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,660
our planet and most of the information

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:59,300
we have about the planet like solid

00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:01,240
participating with the inner core the

00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:07,910
log until the upper mantle and the crust

00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:10,400
or big part as you can see this is just

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:14,780
a plot of an earthquake you can see

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,570
you're going to see that seeing yet ok

00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:19,460
that's it and you can see there are

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:20,990
several ways they propagate with

00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,820
different speeds and in different

00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,830
depending on the material they're

00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:28,390
crossing and support so this is a

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:30,620
example of what we detect here meters

00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:32,870
but as well we can detect other

00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,550
phenomena like in this case is an

00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:38,180
eruption

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:41,180
- I and in May of this year and what we

00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:42,980
can detect us on local events in the

00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,880
next picture we are going and to see

00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:50,810
some spikes and those are just ice

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:53,810
cracks and that happens sometimes when

00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,790
the different engine temperature is

00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,970
higher in this case was Delta in

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:01,850
temperature of like 20 degrees and the

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:06,950
ice was really cracking and we can tell

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:09,200
as well we detect the activity and in

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:13,550
the next picture you would see it this

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,490
it reversed either utter it brings the

00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:18,290
container with few herbs the food and

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:20,590
all the material we need we need an

00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:23,750
station

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:26,900
as well since we are located close to

00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:31,160
the South Pole we are students of course

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:34,060
and as you probably know we have North

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:37,640
and the South port traffic poles and he

00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,860
related to the rotation axis of the

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:42,770
planet but as well we have magnetic

00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:44,600
poles and disposed inside with a

00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:47,120
geographic person they are continuous

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,800
moving and so measurement we are taking

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:57,890
here allow us to track the motion it

00:30:51,800 --> 00:31:00,110
sports and as well we have what called

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:05,510
the geomagnetic paused it belongs to

00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:09,020
another coordinate system and this is

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:13,310
responded to a perfect deport center of

00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:17,740
the planet and that is usually used and

00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:22,220
medical modeling and ltos explain why

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:24,770
mobile is it centric above us and not on

00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:31,150
the South Pole or Magnetic Pole the

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:34,640
South Pole respond to the station and

00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:37,820
the Magnetic Pole gonna be metered far

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,450
away from the coast look to the did you

00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:44,660
the French station on the cost and the

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:47,450
geomagnetic pole is close but as well we

00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:49,640
conduct studies concerning the space

00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:51,970
weather so the accident between the

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:56,140
solar activity and the Magneto's

00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:59,060
atmosphere and this phenomena is the

00:31:56,140 --> 00:32:01,430
particularly important close to the post

00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,120
because there are particles that are

00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:08,150
injected in the atmosphere and that

00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:11,630
interfere with our use human activity

00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:18,380
but in space in a planet and especially

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:22,340
for what is a satellite

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:24,740
operative and telecommunication as well

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,430
the power the electricity distribution

00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,430
basically

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:37,309
here I take care of 50 computers

00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:41,600
different from practice from ik mounted

00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:44,630
servers at the device this appliance is

00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,270
a raspberry PI's or a knows that

00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:51,740
whatever device we can use that

00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:54,650
acquisition we use Python mainly for

00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:56,690
prayer and processing of data validation

00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:59,780
of that of additional data at the most

00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:02,630
of the data we collect are sent to the

00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,750
search groups in Europe where the data

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,799
is foreign Allah is there and then

00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,340
contributed to create models at

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,130
geographical and global scale

00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:17,030
concerning the telecommunication scene

00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:20,360
yet take care of the demand tennis and

00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:22,640
that means raishin of the local net and

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,400
as well of the telecommunication via

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,190
satellite and array oh we have a

00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:30,320
satellite connection of 500 per seconds

00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:33,020
so we are very good at in whatever

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:36,740
activity we are conducting here for

00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:40,400
instance for this complicated connection

00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:43,610
other possible and while we are in the

00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:47,260
same connection or email whatever there

00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:50,720
so that with station brightening

00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,299
whatever and we send all this data to

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,299
Europe store larger part of the treaty

00:33:53,299 --> 00:34:00,200
dedicate just send this data we are Isis

00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:11,090
HR sync and whatever it is - no - Europe

00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:11,770
where are the other groups and ok ok

00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:20,360
time

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:20,360
[Applause]

00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:27,690
hi everybody my name is Kevin posnick

00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:31,530
and I'm I'm here working for the

00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:35,730
European Space Agency and so is a sense

00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:38,070
doctor down here every year to study the

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:41,100
adaptation of the human body to the

00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,860
extreme environments here and this is a

00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:45,600
perfect spot to do this because

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:48,420
Concordia is the best and elegant we

00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,980
have on earth to a base on Mars for

00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,680
example or to prolong distant

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,870
spaceflight this is of course because of

00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,590
the extreme environment we have outside

00:34:54,870 --> 00:35:00,720
so we have the cold that forces us to

00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:03,030
dress up accordingly before we go

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:05,340
outside we have three and a half months

00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:08,040
of darkness the complete isolation

00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:10,500
during the winter months and a small

00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:14,670
crew size so we are 13 people for nine

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,130
months and all this makes it a perfect

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,190
place to study for future human

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,950
spaceflight missions so I have four

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:24,690
different experiments four different

00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:29,220
scientists laboratories throughout

00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:31,560
Europe two of which are concerning the

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:33,930
immune system so what I do is well

00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,530
basically I study my crew members here I

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:40,080
take monthly blood samples and urine

00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:44,130
samples and stool samples and hair sound

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:48,660
saliva and fun stuff and I analyze it in

00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:50,850
a lab I have here it with two studies

00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:53,760
I'm looking at a evolution of the immune

00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:56,190
cells in the isolation which is very

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,290
interesting because of the an told you

00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:00,390
we have no microbes outside that could

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:02,700
attack us and since we are always the

00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,460
same searching people inside here it's

00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:08,340
also nothing new coming from us anymore

00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,650
after a few months so we are looking at

00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:14,550
how the immune cells react to this kind

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:17,730
of stress and but we can see now is that

00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:20,820
in the first months also because of they

00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:23,670
have hyperbaric hypoxia we have you in

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,350
the first month actually the activity of

00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:28,170
living cells is decreasing because they

00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:29,520
have nothing to do but as soon as turns

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,970
to chronic

00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,140
hypoxia stages because it amuses

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:38,760
actually having an overreaction and

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,800
doing more than they were doing they

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,589
would usually doing like Europe for

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,270
example which is also by usually get

00:36:43,589 --> 00:36:48,720
sick as soon as the new summer people

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:51,560
come in Iraq so this is quite

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,089
interesting and then another study M

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,540
looks at the acclimatization of our

00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:59,970
bodies to hypoxia and all the high

00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,030
altitude practically so you can never

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:07,280
really adapt to this but you can

00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:11,490
acclimatized we are at 3,300 meters

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:17,070
which is about 3800 as it would be on

00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:20,339
and around Europe yeah

00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:24,510
so basically this is also blood tests

00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:28,190
and urine tests and a lot lots of

00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:31,410
questionnaires or altitude sickness and

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:34,440
well the fourth experiment is concerning

00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:37,980
the decrease of piloting skills and fine

00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:42,089
motor skills Molly is going to put a

00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:44,609
picture we we have here is a simulator

00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:46,920
of a Soyuz capsule which is of course

00:37:44,609 --> 00:37:51,119
the space rocket it currently brings us

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:54,359
to not to the ISS and yeah you can see

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:58,109
it here so this is well it's like a

00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:59,750
computer game basically it's the cockpit

00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:03,180
of the Soyuz with three monitors

00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:07,619
joysticks and what we do is we apply the

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,940
the Soyuz to the ISS VDOT and my

00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,670
crewmates do this every month

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,010
monitor their skills and along with

00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:16,830
other fine motor tests and cognitive

00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,839
tests and more questionnaires I look at

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:20,369
how their skills are improving or

00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:23,220
decreasing or staying the same

00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:25,680
during the isolation period and this of

00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:27,690
course is very important because if it's

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:30,540
under a crew of astronauts the mass for

00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,520
example you want to make absolutely sure

00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,710
that once they arrive they will still be

00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,619
able to land the spaceship on Mars and

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:41,839
well and return safely home backed off

00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:41,839
as well so yeah

00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:46,290
okay week

00:38:51,189 --> 00:38:59,239
we pick just a couple of mints or 50

00:38:56,349 --> 00:39:04,219
hello everybody I'm Philip Oh Kelly

00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:07,369
qualia physicist and I'm here I'm here

00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:11,059
for taking about around three projects

00:39:07,369 --> 00:39:12,469
mainly this projects concern meteorology

00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:16,039
so all kind of methodological

00:39:12,469 --> 00:39:21,109
measurements the study of the solar

00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:24,159
radiation we have a solar solar

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:27,409
radiation Observatory linked to like

00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:30,319
worldwide network for measuring

00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:32,419
radiation in coming out coming and all

00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:35,409
sort of all this kind of of different

00:39:32,419 --> 00:39:38,589
different wavelength and and also

00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:42,799
running measurement with to a lighter

00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:47,899
facility which that allows us to to

00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:50,599
study the lower stratosphere whether the

00:39:47,899 --> 00:39:54,019
porous transfer clouds form and dissolve

00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:58,449
and enhance the the dissolution of the

00:39:54,019 --> 00:40:02,239
ozone and as you can see in this picture

00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:10,759
that will soon arrive from Antarctica to

00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:13,699
a deeper I hope this is our lighter

00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:16,399
facilities facility which is located in

00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:24,879
a shelter outside the base around some

00:40:16,399 --> 00:40:30,739
hundreds meter out of the pace and and

00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:32,629
in the next picture you will see the the

00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:36,159
facility for the measurement of the

00:40:32,629 --> 00:40:39,489
solar of the radiation and photometers

00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:43,189
measuring long wave and short wave

00:40:39,489 --> 00:40:46,369
situated located on a device called the

00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:49,069
solar tracker tracker which allows this

00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:53,059
instrument to follow the Sun and perform

00:40:49,069 --> 00:40:57,019
these kind of measurements and at the

00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:59,839
end I have the other as I told you we

00:40:57,019 --> 00:41:02,389
are measuring a temperature humidity and

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,610
so forth and I will just briefly show

00:41:02,389 --> 00:41:07,300
show you

00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:15,160
plot and I will probably recognize it

00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:18,190
has been made with Python and okay and

00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:21,030
this is one of this is his plot showing

00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:25,180
windchill which is an interesting

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:29,080
measure that combined temperature and

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:31,390
wind speed and allows us to have in just

00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,730
in a glance have an idea what's the

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:36,280
what's the weather like outside as you

00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:38,530
can see from the statistics and the

00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,650
bottom of the screen we reach the

00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:44,820
temperature of wind chill temperature of

00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:47,590
minus 99 while the minimum temperature

00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:50,230
real temperature we reach doing this

00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:53,350
this winter until now it's around the

00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:56,590
minus seventy seven point one which is

00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:59,080
not it's not the it's not a record but I

00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,900
can tell you that it's already quite a

00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:06,640
fresh environment for expression cold

00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:08,950
environment and lastly every day I'm

00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,810
performing a rat is sounding it means

00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:14,260
that I'm launching a balloon full of

00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:17,230
helium in order to track the condition

00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:20,290
of the of the atmosphere of the lower

00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:23,460
atmosphere it means from the ground

00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:26,890
until thirty kilometers in the summer at

00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:30,700
only 15 during this time of the year and

00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:32,950
for this reason we with collaboration of

00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:35,470
my crewmates we prepared a special

00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:39,490
balloon a special edition balloon just

00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:44,550
to celebrate in Skype with you and so

00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:44,550
please mark help me

00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:52,199
[Applause]

00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:07,630
we launched this balloon tomorrow

00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:10,420
evening and and and we hope that it will

00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:15,630
reach really high elevation altitude and

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:18,369
they will measure for us with measure

00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,930
temperature relative humidity and all

00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:22,150
this kind of variable that are really

00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:25,210
important for studying atmosphere from

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:27,580
meteorological reason and for a better

00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:38,980
understand and better improve our models

00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:40,750
thank you I don't know I don't know

00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:45,100
whether you can actually see this Oh

00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:47,740
actually you can't see this so this is

00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:50,770
the audience so please get Kanto

00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:57,220
Antarctic you're waving I hope you can

00:43:50,770 --> 00:44:00,700
see this full room we have like another

00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:03,040
five minutes for two questions if you

00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:05,320
have a question please come here and be

00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:10,890
quick because we already have a little

00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:16,180
delay so which path in person G is good

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:17,700
set a trick question no do it what this

00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:23,770
is a trick question

00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:26,310
Oh which Python version do you use asks

00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:26,310
Joel

00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:33,000
[Music]

00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:38,369
[Laughter]

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,369
[Applause]

00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:50,210
[Applause]

00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:52,579
but working hard so maybe we will meet

00:44:50,210 --> 00:45:00,829
in some years a few years the next icon

00:44:52,579 --> 00:45:06,170
I have a question about this NASA

00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:09,799
experiment on people behavior there's a

00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:13,369
question on the NASA experience on the

00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:15,829
people behavior so how not to make sure

00:45:13,369 --> 00:45:17,210
that people are safe during this

00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:19,609
experiments and are there any

00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:22,880
regulations that must be followed on

00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:25,700
such experiments and how does Martha

00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:30,799
make sure that their people are safe

00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:32,900
during these experiments people are

00:45:30,799 --> 00:45:34,519
monitored quite extensively there are

00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:36,440
cameras inside atoms that feel

00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:38,480
continuously the common areas for

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:41,240
research but the total load detected

00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:44,200
emergency then we have the recent

00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,519
emergency funds that can be used like

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:48,470
exactly if there is an emergency and

00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:49,819
there is like simulations need to stop

00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:52,730
for safety reasons we have a way to

00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:54,500
contact help and then there are the

00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:57,829
procedures which are which have been

00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:59,569
developed for was a possible emergency

00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:01,609
for instance if there is a volcanic

00:45:59,569 --> 00:46:06,349
eruption they will be hearing impaired

00:46:01,609 --> 00:46:08,349
yes sir so we were aware isolated but

00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:10,549
were quite money not so there was no

00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:13,150
like that NASA is very careful about

00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:13,150
safety

00:46:14,859 --> 00:46:17,720
no it's easy

00:46:16,279 --> 00:46:19,460
why should I repeat all the questions

00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,009
come come upstairs and ask the question

00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:26,240
directly I'm just it's easier hello

00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:28,430
next question here all right hi so I was

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,049
wondering I think three months of

00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:35,119
darkness now how does this has this

00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:37,609
affected your group dynamics for better

00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,230
or worse or better maybe both one

00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:40,820
example for better and one example for

00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:47,180
worse

00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:50,540
I have to say that in spite also because

00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:55,090
I the middle of the winter the 21 of

00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:59,120
German there is one week of holiday we

00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:05,630
is called midwinter and it's one week of

00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:20,200
party so we because you know that the

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:23,890
Sun is coming so it's a good week ok so

00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:27,620
thank you very much I think this was the

00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:30,200
farthest away ever keynote for Europe -

00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:32,480
ever and probably also the coldest one

00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:34,580
so thank you very much

00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,040
I think this gave Rizal great insight

00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:41,030
into your work and how is life in

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,210
Antarctica yeah and thanks again and

00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:43,210
again
