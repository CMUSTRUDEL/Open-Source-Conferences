By Łukasz Kąkol

Idiomatic Python is beautiful. If you’re new to Python, this talk is for you because I’m going to reveal the charm of python in front of you. I’ll present how boilerplate code can be replaced with idiomatic python. If you’re experienced python developer, this talk is also for you because I’ll compare the performance of the idiomatic code, both from CPU and memory point of view. Some of these results may surprise you.
