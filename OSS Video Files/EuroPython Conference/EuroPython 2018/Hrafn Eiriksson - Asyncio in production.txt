	Asyncio in production
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Lammermuir]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Hrafn Eiriksson

Much has been written about asynchronous programming in Python, especially after the introduction of asyncio into the standard library of the language. We've all seen the benchmarks that tell us how asyncio-powered web servers massively outperform their non-asyncio counterparts for trivial routes and we've seen the articles that tell us how to make the move from flask to aiohttp and why we should. 

Despite all of this, the question remains: How is it to use asyncio in a production setting? What are the pain points of migrating a large application to use asyncio? How does the performance of this real-world application differ after the migration? Is it still just unicorns and fairy tales? The goal of this talk is to address these questions. 

If you are curious about taking the step from asyncio-dabbling to creating actual mission critical software systems in asyncio; this is the talk for you!
