Description: 
	Quantum Computing: a Very Gentle Glimpse into a Possible Future
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Smarkets]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Nick Radcliffe

This talk will aim to demystify quantum computing and will assume no prior knowledge. The speaker, while having studied Quantum Field Theory many years ago, has only relatively recently started learning properly about  Quantum Computing, and is going to try to take advantage of the fact that the ideas are relatively new to him to explain the key concepts simply, to an audience (probably) consisting mostly of non-experts in quantum computing.

Key questions I will try to cover are likely to include
  * What is quantum mechanics anyway?
  * What are quantum computers? Are they real? And are they really faster/more powerful than classical computers?
  * What is a qubit (the quantum computing analogue of a bit)
  * What problems are likely to be solved well by quantum computers?
  * How do you program a quantum computer?
  * How do you get results out of a quantum computer? What kind of results are they anyway? Do you have to visit other universes to get them?
  * Can you get access to quantum computers online and use Python to program them (kind-of!)
  * Will quantum computers break all encryption?
  * What are Shor's and Grover's algorithms and (just possibly) how do they work?
  * What are the challenges with building practical quantum computers?
  * What is the Python story with Quantum Computing?

	00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,879
thank you good afternoon this was a talk

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:11,320
I didn't really expect to give because I

00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:12,639
thought it would be rejected since it

00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,029
doesn't really have any Python in it

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,710
very much Python but I put it in to

00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:20,620
encourage me to learn more about quantum

00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:23,440
computing and as I learnt a bit more I

00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,420
decided to change the subtitle to a

00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,640
gentle ish glance into a likely future

00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,260
and then as I actually came to preparing

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,960
the slides I decided all I could really

00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:32,949
possibly aim to do is to explain why

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,480
everything you've ever read about

00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:37,780
content computing is probably wrong

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,329
unless you've read the real stuff so I'm

00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:43,000
gonna try and give you one or two really

00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:46,960
important Corrections to a lot of what I

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,980
think is misinformation it's great to

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
see so many people here I'm assuming

00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,690
some of you are here for in Edinburgh

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,670
for Europe - maybe quite a lot of you

00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,610
that's not actually why I'm here I live

00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,760
here I came to Edinburgh in 1986 because

00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:02,410
I was invited by Peter Higgs humblebrag

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,289
the guy they built the LHC for to

00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,369
discover the Large Hadron Collider and

00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:07,929
had the privilege of being taught

00:01:06,369 --> 00:01:09,909
quantum field theory by him and I say

00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:11,530
that not to imply that everything I get

00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:13,899
wrong is his fault at all because he's a

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,189
genius but just I have spent a lot of

00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:17,139
time thinking about this and what you're

00:01:15,189 --> 00:01:19,029
gonna find during this talk is at

00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:20,829
various points I'm going to say things

00:01:19,029 --> 00:01:22,179
that are completely ridiculous and

00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:23,469
obviously wrong

00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:24,700
and you're gonna think these things are

00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:26,170
completely impossible and you're gonna

00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,670
remind it of Alice in Wonderland or

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,770
rather through the looking-glass where

00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:32,439
she said there's no use trying one can't

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:34,539
believe impossible things I am going to

00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,999
ask you to believe things that will

00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:38,770
appear to be impossible it's entirely up

00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:40,840
to you whether you do but it's something

00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,729
that everyone who tries to come to terms

00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,929
with quantum physics has to do and

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:48,459
there's there's no way around it I'm

00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:49,840
afraid if you have read or learnt

00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:51,759
anything about quantum computing

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,389
probably the most likely thing you've

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,009
heard is that if it ever really works

00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:59,499
cryptography is in trouble and SSL the

00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:01,270
security the Internet's in trouble and

00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:03,489
there's quite a lot of truth to that not

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,989
not complete truth not all cryptography

00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,270
is in trouble but certainly cryptography

00:02:04,989 --> 00:02:08,979
based on the difficulty of factorizing

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:12,220
big semi prime numbers is in trouble

00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,570
which is what SSL's based on and RSA

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:18,380
public key cryptography

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:22,400
so yeah the basic idea with public key

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:23,960
cryptography is that it's very how it's

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,430
easy to multiply two numbers together

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,410
but it's very hard to figure out what

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,030
the two prime factors are if you have a

00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,180
semi prime number a one that has exactly

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,590
two prime factors but we need to be

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,210
rather precise when I say it's hard

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,750
that's actually not true at all it's

00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:40,280
incredibly easy in fact it's slow we can

00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:43,340
write just five lines of Python that

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,800
will factorize any semi prime number

00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:48,830
this is only really using two things

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,100
it's using the fact that we know that if

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,060
we have two facts in number one of them

00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,470
can't be bigger than the square root of

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,400
the NAM because obviously if we multiply

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,300
two things that are bigger than the

00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,420
square root of the number we're gonna

00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,920
get something bigger than the number the

00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,900
other thing about this incredibly

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,360
simplistic approach to it is it uses one

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,390
difficult or one slow operation which is

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,380
this percent operator here which is

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:14,420
integer division right integer modulo

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:15,980
division and division is slow so if we

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,230
didn't care about how long each

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,030
individual step takes there might

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:22,100
actually be a more interesting way to do

00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,920
it which would be dramatically less

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,660
efficient but would paralyze well so we

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,200
might just write a function that given

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,390
our semi prime number n big number n and

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,220
two possible factors just returns true

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:35,959
if it's truth to not two factors

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,730
multiplied together to give it and false

00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,380
otherwise and then we could just do a

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,730
double loop one over the small numbers

00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:43,970
and one over the big numbers ones bigger

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,920
than the square root and one of those if

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,590
it is indeed semi prime would come back

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,300
with with our result and if we had a

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:51,980
parallel computer if we had a really big

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,690
parallel computer like one with at least

00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,050
n squared processes which is probably

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,430
really quite big offends big then things

00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,920
would be quite nice because we could

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,630
just you know on one processor try well

00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,970
you know does fifteen I know fifteen is

00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:06,830
not a very big number but in this is 15

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,720
equals two times three times 15 equals

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,610
two times four and so on and one of

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,200
these would find our answer so this

00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,450
would be a nice way if we had a

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,459
sufficiently large parallel computer I'm

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,720
sorry I'm moving away from the mic if we

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,729
had a sufficiently large parallel

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,410
computer to solve the problem but there

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,030
is a detail missing and it's it's quite

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:25,580
an important detail which is that it's

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,080
no good are just finding the answer on

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,770
processor seven especially if we've

00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,199
actually got

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,729
say 100 quadrillion processors because

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,500
we probably not connected to all of them

00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,759
so what we have to do at the end of the

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,349
operation is we have to collect our

00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,060
answer we have to arrange for the answer

00:04:36,349 --> 00:04:39,979
somehow to filter back to the actual

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,750
processor we're talking to the host

00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,889
processor if you like and that's not

00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,840
difficult at all even if we have a

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:46,580
hundred quadrillion we can do a you know

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,470
a reduce type operation and reduce them

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,880
in pairs and get the answer back but it

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,220
is something we have to remember and

00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:55,759
that will become important in about 15

00:04:52,220 --> 00:05:01,190
minutes so hold this thought we're going

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,840
to do some physics in a minute you

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,819
probably all know what bits are I'm sure

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,340
you all know what bits are bits of boxes

00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:11,240
that contain zeros and one zeros or ones

00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,729
right and if it's a bit in random access

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,560
memory then you can set that value to

00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:17,060
either 1 or 0 and you can read that

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,039
value back and find out whether it's 1

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,210
and 0 and if nothing goes wrong the same

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,099
thing that you set it to is what you'll

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,349
get back when you read it back any time

00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:26,330
later and so the crucial thing of course

00:05:24,349 --> 00:05:28,970
is that the same bit in random access

00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:31,120
memory in memory we can change can have

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,699
different values at different times

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,870
hopefully that's not news to anyone so

00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,669
what about constant computing or

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,280
constant computing is based on quantum

00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:42,380
bits and quantum bits are Phoenicia are

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,699
boxes you can put zeros and ones in as

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,710
well it's just a slightly funny shaped

00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:48,409
boxes that Paul Dirac great British

00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,969
physicists designed and called cats now

00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:51,740
these actually have a very specific

00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:54,759
meaning but for our purposes just think

00:05:51,740 --> 00:06:01,849
of it as a box that contain a 0 or a 1

00:05:54,759 --> 00:06:04,520
or possibly both not like half but like

00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:08,270
maybe it's partly a 0 and it's partly a

00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,800
1 at the same time and we would write

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,110
that in fact there's 1 over root 2 of

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,330
the cat 0 plus 1 over root 2 if number

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,740
one why 1 over root 2 not 1/2 well it

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,990
turns out we square these numbers in

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,400
fact we take the if they're complex

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:21,500
numbers which they tend to be we take

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,780
the complex conjugate and multiply that

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,650
by the thing to get our probability well

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,990
it doesn't matter it's just the way we

00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,300
write it but I want to go back to this

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,180
this important point that a single qubit

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:35,360
a single quantum bit can be

00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,400
simultaneously partly 1 and partly 0 ok

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,969
and that's so important I'm going to

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,719
shout it as well a single qubit can be

00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:46,039
both

00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:47,629
1 & 0 at the same time in some sense and

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,459
you're going to say well that makes them

00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:51,529
a sense this is impossible and I'm going

00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:53,689
to say I completely agree that makes no

00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:56,839
sense it's impossible it just turns out

00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:58,939
that's how the universe works and what

00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,529
I'm going to try and do is tell you why

00:06:58,939 --> 00:07:01,669
physicists even physicists who've

00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:03,339
thought about this an awful long time

00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:05,989
whom it still makes absolutely no sense

00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,669
believe this and we're going to take our

00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:09,619
cue from Fineman one of the greatest

00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:12,229
quantum physicists ever brilliant

00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:14,719
teacher who introduces volume 3 of his

00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:16,219
lecture series with three experiments

00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:17,989
the first of which is an experiment with

00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:19,159
waves so think about water or think

00:07:17,989 --> 00:07:20,689
about light if you prefer but I'm

00:07:19,159 --> 00:07:22,610
thinking specifically about water here

00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:24,079
where we've got something that's bobbing

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,759
up and down on the water creating waves

00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,339
or maybe it's a it's a set of drips

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,689
falling on the water creating waves and

00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,279
we've got a barrier in front of it

00:07:29,689 --> 00:07:33,110
that's got a couple of holes in it in a

00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:34,279
wall and then we've got an absorber at

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,719
the back and what we know about waves

00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,689
what hopefully everyone knows about

00:07:35,719 --> 00:07:40,939
waves is that they exhibit interference

00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:43,849
that is if we have multiple drops

00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:46,699
falling on a puddle then the waves

00:07:43,849 --> 00:07:48,589
around the droplets spread out but they

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,819
just go through each other right they

00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:51,289
don't they don't stop they just go

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:53,059
through each other and at the point

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:54,860
where they meet they exhibit

00:07:53,059 --> 00:07:57,169
interference so if two troughs come

00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,550
together two troughs if two Peaks come

00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:00,829
together like this we get a bigger peak

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,550
and that's constructive interference and

00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:08,319
where a peak meets a trough they cancel

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,819
out and we get destructive interference

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,379
no great surprises there and exactly the

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,329
same thing happens with light if we have

00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:16,159
the same double slit experiment we make

00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:17,899
the slits really close together then

00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:19,009
what we'll find is right behind the

00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,839
search we'll get this really bright

00:08:19,009 --> 00:08:22,939
point because the paths are the same

00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,589
length but if we move a bit to the side

00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,079
then one of the paths will be half a

00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,879
wavelength longer than the other path so

00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,169
we'll get negative into we'll get

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,029
destructive interference and they'll

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,909
cancel out and we get this this black

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,870
band and then when when the difference

00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,610
in the path lengths is a whole

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,180
wavelength again we'll get back to

00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:42,860
positive interference and so forth so

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,439
now we'll do an experiment with bullets

00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,879
and it's exactly the same setup just

00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:47,870
slightly larger we've got a rattling

00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,189
machine gun we're not going to kill

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,309
anyone but don't worry no threads will

00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:54,380
die in this presentation bullets do not

00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:55,640
exhibit interference they might

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,200
occasionally bounce off each

00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,050
and all sorts of crazy stuff will happen

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,340
but if when one hole is open this is the

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:02,930
distribution that we tend to see of

00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,640
bullets from this rattling machine gun

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,320
and this is the other then we just add

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,790
up those two distributions and that's or

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,460
it being if the slits are closed if the

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,780
holes are closed together then actually

00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,700
the most likely place to find a bullet

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:17,080
will be in the middle bullets do not

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,640
exhibit interference we know this right

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,080
so now let's suit with electrons now you

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,310
know what elections are electrons are

00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,230
like tiny little bullets they're the

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,700
things that hover around in a sort of

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,710
cloud around the nucleus of atoms

00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,510
they're incredibly small in fact they

00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,590
probably don't have any size we're not

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,300
certain but they're kind of point-like

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:33,710
but we can do things with them we can

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,090
have electron guns that are just like

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,530
well actually they're not very like

00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,420
machine guns but we have electron guns

00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,560
that fire them out over some angle and

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,690
again if we have slits that are close

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,330
together we can do the same experiment

00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:47,570
and the completely unbelievable thing is

00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:50,150
that electrons do exhibit interference

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:52,760
exactly the same way all the other way

00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,440
phenomena we know about it and you think

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,470
well that doesn't really seem to make

00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:00,680
any sense but maybe what's going on is

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,760
maybe electrons are going through both

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,050
slits and they're kind of bouncing off

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,490
each other just like we can imagine

00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,650
bullets hitting into each other and

00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,570
somehow they're causing this

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,710
interference pattern not quite clear how

00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,240
that would happen but maybe that's

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:13,070
happening but that's not what's

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:15,200
happening we know that it's not what's

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:17,060
happening because if you slow if you

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,010
reduce the power of the electron gun so

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,800
that there's only a single electron in

00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:24,470
the system at any time you still get the

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,120
interference pattern which I know makes

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,680
no sense but there's a lot of not making

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,110
any sense in this talk the electrons act

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,150
as if they were being guided by waves

00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,130
and that the wave went through both

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:38,720
slits and the wave actually caused

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,910
interference and the position of the

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,110
electron that we measure is only the

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,970
places where there's positive

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,150
interference and where it cancels out we

00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,710
never find the electron and in fact

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,480
that's exactly how quantum mechanics

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:51,830
describes the world so Schrodinger's

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,250
equation and all the more modern

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,760
versions like Dirac's equation describe

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,200
the the the path of electrons the the

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,180
the evolution of electrons and all other

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,430
particles in the form of a wave function

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,890
a complex wave function whose amplitude

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,810
at any point is a complex number and if

00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,080
you if you take the size of that out if

00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,580
you

00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,410
if you square that amplitude by taking

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,850
the complex conjugate times itself that

00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,560
gives you the probability of finding the

00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,560
particle at that position in space-time

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,450
so the wave function can be in what we

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,980
call a superposition of sites that is a

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:26,210
mixture of states it can be partly in

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,920
one state partly note it doesn't have to

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:29,150
be a 50/50 mixture it can be any mixture

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,940
we're like you can even these

00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:33,080
coefficients can even be complex

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,420
Schrodinger's equation tells us or

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,620
although more modern versions tell us

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:42,260
how sy evolves over time but whenever we

00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:44,030
actually measure where the particle is

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,500
we always find it either went through

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,570
the left or the right so if we measure

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,880
the qubit we always get a 1 or a 0 out

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,800
not a mixture but in between when we're

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,750
not looking at it it's as if it's in

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,100
both States partly we talk about the

00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,360
wavefunction collapsing or at least we

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,080
used to talk about the wavefunction

00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,300
collapsing

00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,640
now you're probably gonna say that still

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,870
makes no sense and again I can't really

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:07,070
argue with you but what I don't want you

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,300
to think is that means there's something

00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:10,430
bad about quantum mechanics because

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:12,350
quantum mechanics is literally the best

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,850
scientific theory we have and the best

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,140
scientific theory we have ever had it's

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,670
one of the two great pillars of physics

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:18,020
there's relativity and they're quantum

00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:19,550
mechanics there's this slight

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,870
embarrassment that they're incompatible

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,440
with each other but don't worry about

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,300
that

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,800
relatives he's really good at the big

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,780
scale quantum mechanics is really big at

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,090
the small scale and in fact there has

00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,590
never been a reproducible experiment

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,510
that disagreed with the results of

00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:34,190
quantum mechanics sometimes quantum

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:35,870
mechanics gives us probabilistic answers

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:37,610
sometimes it gives us definite answers

00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:38,900
but we've actually verified those

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,510
answers more accurate than we've ever

00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,790
verified anything else in the world like

00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,590
to almost a part in a billion it is our

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:47,600
best theory it works if you use the

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:50,600
equations unless you make mistakes you

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,860
always get the right answer the only

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,600
difficulty is understanding what on

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,890
earth the answer means except in terms

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,990
of the probability of where particles

00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:01,940
are now in 1957 a guy called whoever it

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,070
was working for as a student for John

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,480
Archibald wheeler and he came up with a

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:07,220
particular interpretation that is

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,440
favored by almost everyone in quantum

00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,730
computing probably largely because one

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
of the fathers of constant computing

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,030
David Deutsch very strongly advocates

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,710
this way and it gives you a very nice

00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,720
way of thinking about things as long as

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:19,280
you don't mind your head hurting

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,440
whatever it suggested is that every time

00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,670
there are multiple possibilities

00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,400
suggested by quantum theory

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:27,830
what happens is the universe literally

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:29,420
splits and all the different

00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,070
possibilities are realized in different

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,560
universes its sliding doors if you've

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,880
seen that film both things happen or in

00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:36,080
fact perhaps not even just both things

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,940
but if there are lots possibilities

00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,920
maybe as many as a continuous of

00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,750
infinity of different things happen in

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,190
different universes so there are loads

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,780
of all of you sitting here in different

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,640
universes just with very slightly

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,220
quantum states for a slightly different

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,840
quantum states on what the many-worlds

00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:52,430
interpretation says is that when we

00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,570
measure the outcome of an experiment

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,310
when we measure upside what we're

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:56,750
actually doing is we're finding out the

00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,220
value of say in our universe the

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:01,160
particularly universe we're in at that

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,080
point but the really interesting thing

00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,280
is that the different universe is

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,840
interfere with each other the wave

00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,040
functions from different universes

00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,790
interfere with each other you get

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,010
constructive and destructive

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:11,630
interference and they influence the

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,760
probability of your finding yourself in

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:16,340
any particular universe so that when we

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,900
look at the qubit if if it's in a

00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,240
superposition of States with alpha and

00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,070
beta then the probability of getting of

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,500
finding ourselves in a universe where

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:26,600
the answers zero will be proportional to

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,190
essentially alpha squared and the other

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,810
possibility will be beta squared and

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,980
again you say this doesn't make any

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,160
sense I know I'm getting a bit

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,270
repetitive here but this seems to work

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,480
now let's go back to stuff we all

00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,550
understand bytes and words and things

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,540
like that so obviously we don't only do

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:45,920
bits in computing we do bytes as well

00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:48,140
bytes are eight bits we look at longer

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,730
words like 64 bit words and so forth

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,520
because it's it's pretty difficult to do

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:54,920
anything interesting with a single bit

00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:57,200
we can do something similar with qubits

00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,880
we can form Q bytes if you like or key

00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,770
words if you like quantum bytes and

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,550
quantum words using something called

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:07,760
entanglement an entanglement is a

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,520
phenomenon whereby multiple qubits which

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,200
are discrete physical things but

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,530
multiple of them are described by a

00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:17,660
single wave function and that means that

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,570
we say that they're entangled that is to

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,490
say if we worked with eight qubits then

00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,140
obviously that could represent up to 256

00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:27,640
different different values there are up

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:32,630
to 255 say then we can actually have a

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:34,820
wave function that describes the the the

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,320
state of this Q byte if you like as

00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:38,900
being partly zero

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,280
1 all the way up to partly 255 and we

00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:45,230
can hold that thing for a while and do

00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:47,720
computations on it which is weird so

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,340
probably you're getting where I'm going

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,540
here right what why was I talking about

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,680
all this parallel computing stuff why

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,240
was I talking about really stupid

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,620
algorithms that would work well if we

00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,570
could run over multiple universes

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,790
presumably what I'm saying is that

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,220
quantum computing is like this free

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,050
parallel computing where we just run our

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,330
computer we'll run our computation

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,950
across loads of different universes and

00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:10,190
one of them finds the answer and we're

00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:11,900
done that's how I'm glad there are

00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,820
people wincing that's how almost every

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,530
pop article I've ever read about quantum

00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,290
computing makes it sound like quantum

00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,510
computing works and there's a little bit

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:22,700
of truth in it we can set the

00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:25,700
computation up like this and we can set

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,530
up the superposition of the state of the

00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,720
input state of the quantum computer so

00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:30,620
that every computer every universe would

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,960
do a different version of the

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:40,100
computation so it's kind of right but

00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:46,310
there's a but and it's quite a big butt

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:47,720
and the butt is that it's not just the

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,520
quantum computer and the qubits that

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,590
spread across the universe is it's us as

00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,510
well and so if we do set up the

00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,950
computation this way the trouble is we

00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,600
don't get to choose which universe we

00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:57,950
lock up the answer in so almost

00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,720
certainly in this case we're going to

00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,910
find you know we tried three times four

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,360
and it didn't equal 15 and and the games

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:06,860
are bogey so if you take nothing else

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,270
out of this talk even if you think all

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,770
this I'm sorry I wasn't going

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,089
to spare you don't think all this stuff

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,770
have said about quantum computing can't

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:13,970
possibly be right on a mechanic's stuff

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,540
this guy clearly doesn't know what he's

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:17,390
talking about

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,839
what you should remember is this is not

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:23,270
how quantum computers work it's not free

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:26,180
parallel computing across universes it's

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:31,490
a lot more complicated than that thank

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,080
you very much ah but I'm not done

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,700
because I'm gonna try and tell you how

00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,840
it does work kind of sorta which is a

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:42,200
bit harder it's quite a lot harder

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,270
actually so to benefit from quantum

00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,940
computing what we need to do is we need

00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:48,710
to find algorithms in which all the bad

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,550
bits of the computation or all the dead

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,040
ends all the bits

00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:53,570
don't want exhibit destructive

00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,010
interference if we say finger this

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:56,060
multiple universe model which i think is

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:57,950
nonsense by the way it's not the

00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:59,420
interpretation I favor I like one that

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,650
goes backwards in time instead it's much

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:05,300
better we have to arrange things so that

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,860
all the bad solutions all the things

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,200
we're not interested in destructively

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,520
interfere and kill each other and the

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,010
good solution the thing we're actually

00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:15,710
looking for exhibits constructive

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:18,200
interference ideally so that we get with

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,120
probability one the answer that we're

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,010
actually looking for and if we do that

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,360
then it doesn't matter which universe

00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,860
we're in because all the universes

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,260
produce the same answer we're looking

00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,660
for global properties of the computation

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,980
of the system that we're doing and if

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,290
you heard of Shor's algorithm which is

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:34,970
the the main way that this semi prime

00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:36,890
factorization problem is tackled

00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,830
that's what Shor's algorithm is it's an

00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,020
algorithm that distributes the the work

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:45,380
across the superposition of states such

00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:49,670
that the result is a global property of

00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:51,680
the result of the computation and sure

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,120
so quantum computers have been built not

00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,560
with all that many qubits but they have

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,450
been built and they do work and they

00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,300
have been tested and we have used Shor's

00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:01,880
algorithm to factorize large issue semi

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,340
prime numbers depending on your

00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,380
definition of large-ish biggest we've

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:11,240
done so far is twenty-one but you know

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,210
it's a start it's not like the smallest

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,370
semi prime number there's another way in

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,810
fact of doing quantum computing called

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,700
adiabatic quantum computing and we've

00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:21,920
caught up as high as 143 with that so

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,300
that's even more impressive it turned

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,580
out when they went back and analyzed

00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,050
what happened it also factorized fifty

00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,390
six thousand one hundred and fifty three

00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,740
just sort of as a little bonus which

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,800
they haven't asked for quantum computing

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,330
is a little bit weird you know these

00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,830
aren't incredibly impressive results

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:38,840
numerically because if I run my stupid

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,450
little program it it factorizes fifty

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,620
six thousand 153 and about a twentieth

00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,290
of a second almost all of which is

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,570
Python startup time and even my mind

00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:49,340
crashing lee stupid implementation does

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:50,840
it in about a second and that's running

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,580
on a single core if you gave me N

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,450
squared cause where n is like a really

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,920
big number okay I probably be slower

00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,390
anyway so the summary before I am going

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,460
to try and describe how Shor's algorithm

00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,300
works but I want to do the summary first

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,310
cut

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,540
minutes yes that should be easily enough

00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,630
to explain the whole of the rest of

00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:11,750
quantum physics the physics behind

00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:13,910
quantum computing is 100% sound as as

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:16,040
the president the US might say it's the

00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:18,500
best science we have it really is

00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:23,900
literally the best science we have it

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:25,220
works the engineering is tricky to build

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,810
quantum computers we typically have to

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,340
operate at a few milli Kelvin that is a

00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:31,250
few thousandths of a degree above

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,470
absolute zero and one of the problems is

00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,080
that we can't keep them within order for

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,150
quantum computation to work the system

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,810
has to remain coherent what does that

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,820
mean

00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:42,350
it means that other stuff in the

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,750
universe mustn't interfere with its

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,010
quantum state too much and other stuff

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,420
in this universe and all the other

00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:50,240
universities does have a bit of a habit

00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,710
after not very much time of causing the

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,710
kind of interference we don't want that

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,210
that turns the whole system to a state

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:57,800
that we can't do anything with so it's

00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,840
very hard to to keep the system's

00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,970
coherent but we're getting better at

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,560
this stuff it doesn't seem to be

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,240
anything in physics that say is we

00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,860
couldn't build a big one

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:09,080
we know that in principle the physics

00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,480
work so everything's good so it's

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:15,080
probably coming now I'm gonna try and

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,430
explain Shor's algorithm so the way

00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,400
short algorithm works is it doesn't

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,830
tackle factorization of large semi prime

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,200
numbers head-on it tackles it kind of

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:27,050
sideways it uses a number theoretic

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:31,190
property which is if we take almost any

00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,630
number X and we compute X modulo the

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,280
number that we're trying to factorize

00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,930
modulo n that is you know the percent

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,390
operator in Python integer remainder

00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:41,360
Division in Python so if we compute X

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,040
modulo n and then x squared modulo n and

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:45,140
then X cube modular and we keep on doing

00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,950
that up to a really really really big

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,510
power of X and it helps obviously that

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:52,160
the Python is quite happy with

00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,450
arbitrarily large computations but it

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,010
also helps that we're doing it modulo n

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:57,290
so it doesn't actually get out of

00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:59,300
control that sequence will turn out in

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,060
almost all circumstances to be periodic

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,740
that is this remainder will repeat you

00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,720
might have a very long period but it

00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,550
will repeat over some period that might

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,580
be close to n the number that we're

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,950
trying to factorize but it turns out if

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,050
we can find that period of this sequence

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,190
for X and we can find it for maybe half

00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:18,320
a dozen different X

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:20,320
is that's enough to allow us to figure

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,669
out what the prime factors of n are I

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,080
can't explain exactly why that is you

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:25,309
just have to say it number theorists

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,399
tell us that's that's good and in fact

00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:30,019
our work this out in the 18th century so

00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:32,330
if we can find the period of such

00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:35,509
sequences for a few values of X we can

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:39,950
find out our two prime factors of n so

00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:42,889
how do we do that well what we do and

00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:45,500
this is another really crucial point we

00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:47,539
don't allocate different possible

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,190
factors across R if we if we think of

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,440
this multi-universe thing we don't

00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:53,690
create a superposition over the possible

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,039
factors we create a superposition over

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,970
the elements of this series that we're

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,610
trying to compute ok so we put X mod n

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,350
on 1 or rather X on 1 x squared on the

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,690
next one X cubed on the next one we

00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:09,590
compute on each one what the remainder

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:11,840
when we when we divide it by n is and

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,250
then we use a quantum Fourier transform

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
to find the period you probably all use

00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,580
quantum Fourier transforms that they're

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
exactly like Fourier transforms except

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:19,250
their quantum because you know well you

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,080
know if you know nothing else about our

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:22,429
Fourier transform you know that it finds

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,320
frequencies and you know the frequencies

00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:25,909
of the universal period so if we could

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,429
calculate a quantum Fourier transform

00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:30,049
then we'd be done and that's what we do

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:31,580
in the crucial thing is that the period

00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:33,110
that comes out is a property of the

00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:35,509
whole computation that we can look up in

00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:37,490
any universe 5 minutes yep so I'm gonna

00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:39,379
now try to illustrate this using an idea

00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,789
by Scott Aaronson but he didn't write

00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:42,200
the Python that wrote the JavaScript

00:23:40,789 --> 00:23:44,029
that does the demonstration so I'm going

00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,940
to claim claim some credit so what we

00:23:44,029 --> 00:23:48,919
have to suppose is that my circadian

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,409
clocks a bit off and I'm not on a

00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,019
24-hour cycle on I'm on some other cycle

00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:55,610
and we don't know what it is but I'm

00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:57,559
very regular I get up at the same time

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,690
each day the same time on whatever cycle

00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:02,029
I'm on and what we've got here is we've

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:03,590
got a set of clocks one of which goes

00:24:02,029 --> 00:24:05,090
around once every 21 hours one of which

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:06,470
goes around every 22 hours one of which

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,309
goes around over 23 hours all the way up

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,600
to 30 hours and underneath each clock

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,159
didn't start very well today and

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,559
underneath each clock we've got a pin

00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,570
board with a drawing pin that's stuck in

00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:19,850
the middle at the start and what happens

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,710
is every time I get up I go to each of

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,990
the clocks and I move the pin under each

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,600
clock in the direction that its hands

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,110
are pointing its hands it's only got one

00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,780
hand it's our hand is pointing

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:34,150
and so what happens for most of the

00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,830
clocks is that they do this sort of

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,170
little random walk and it never really

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:40,720
gets very far because because the period

00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:44,050
of the clock doesn't match up with my

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,520
circadian cicle you know the direction

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:47,470
the arrow is pointing is is that the

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,410
arrow that the hand is pointing is

00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:51,970
different at different times on

00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,940
different days on different my whatever

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,800
our days but there's something special

00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,090
about the one that does have the same

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,190
period as me and things that have

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:04,330
multiples of that period and so on which

00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:06,310
is that every time I get up on my clock

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:09,070
the one that actually matches my cycle

00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,330
then the hands going to be pointing in

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:11,470
the same direction and therefore I'm

00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:14,440
going to move the drawing pin in the

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,480
same direction and so if we watch this

00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,010
what we should find happening it's

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,510
JavaScript but it was JavaScript that

00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:22,810
was generated by Python so I think it's

00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:25,180
kosher what we could find is that most

00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:26,830
of these are wandering around in a

00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,770
fairly haphazard way but one of them

00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:31,000
possibly the one for 26 hours is is

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,930
trying to make ad astra

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,400
I'm not gonna let it get out of the

00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,110
circle don't worry it's not gonna it's

00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,960
not gonna run right across the 27 or

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,510
anything but this is the one we can see

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:44,230
quite clearly is in fact the cycle and

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,770
in an incredibly hand-wavy way that's

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,030
how a quantum Fourier transform works it

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,530
arranges the computation in such a way

00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,170
that although all the bad periods

00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:55,360
disappear because we get things that

00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:57,610
cancel out in this in this quantum sense

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,460
but the good period keeps reinforcing

00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:01,840
and therefore whatever universe were in

00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,100
if you think of the multi-universe thing

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,560
or in fact you can forget thinking about

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,030
multi multiple universes now the result

00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,650
of our computation is a well-defined

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:12,250
result which in this case should be the

00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:14,020
26 so we find our period and then we

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:15,820
reverse-engineer that we do that with a

00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,800
few different numbers we find our P and

00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,360
Q we factorized it we've broken the

00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:28,500
internet and everything's good so that's

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:30,580
pretty much what I had to say yep so

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,870
you're welcome to email me about this

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,890
stuff for stuff I actually know about

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:38,730
you can find me on Twitter and I pop up

00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:50,350
in lots of universes

00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:52,820
[Applause]

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,510
thank you very much we've got time for

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:58,700
one question if anyone has one you do

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:04,370
have to come up to the front the

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:09,290
microphones don't walk this time thank

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:11,120
God it's not Peter Higgs one question

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:13,850
like given the fact that like this

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,260
famous algorithm usually require like

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,000
maximum fault tolerance do you think

00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,870
there is any use of quantum computing

00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,120
before we achieve systems I have for the

00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:27,530
required fourth organs to implement the

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,970
quantum algorithm No so the quite start

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,560
if people didn't know I think the

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:32,060
question was basically are quantum

00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,160
computers with short lived

00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,140
small numbers of quantum bits use useful

00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,910
for anything practical no I don't think

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,530
they are I think the they only become

00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:41,990
useful when we actually get long enough

00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,760
coherence times and large enough numbers

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:44,900
of qubits to do meaningful things I

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,180
don't think there are any algorithms

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,440
that do anything there's I mean I could

00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:49,760
be wrong about this but I'm not aware of

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,040
any algorithms that do anything

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,770
interesting in very small amounts of

00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,280
time with very small numbers of qubits

00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:57,280
