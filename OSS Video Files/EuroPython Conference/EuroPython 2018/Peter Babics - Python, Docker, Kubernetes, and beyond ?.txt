	Python, Docker, Kubernetes, and beyond ?

By Peter Babics

Have you ever tried to manage deployment of multiple python applications through various
linux distributions ? If so, you must have heard of Docker and maybe also Kubernetes.
Distributing python applications using docker is simple and allows to create static packages
containing everything required for them to run. Also it allows to freeze everything, packages, available
libraries, files on filesystem.
In my speech I would like to tell you about our brief journey, of moving our trading platform
from standalone application directly on host system, through deploying it in docker and latter
moving it to kubernetes. I will explain our struggles with implementing stable and fast CI using Gitlab CI and Docker,
image (package) storage and cleanup of old images and finally I will tell you how we are deploying
our platform to kubernetes, with nothing more than yaml-s and templating.
