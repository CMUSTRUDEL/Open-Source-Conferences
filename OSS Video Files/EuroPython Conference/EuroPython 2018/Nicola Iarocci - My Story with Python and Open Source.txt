Description: 
	My Story with Python and Open Source
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Kilsyth]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Nicola Iarocci

This is the story of how I (and with me, my company) went from lonely, introvert, C# developer to open-source Python author and maintainer, speaker, trainer, consultant, and all-around community junkie. With some luck, in the process, you will also hear a few hints on how to become a good open source contributor and have a chance to ponder on the pros and cons (yes there are cons too) of going full monty with open source. We will also look at what changed in my company as we slowly switched from closed, in-house eco-systems to the open source field.

00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,919
so let me start with a couple of

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,230
questions how many of you of you are

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,509
actually using open source in the

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,180
everyday workflow we heat professional

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:21,180
or hobby or whatever so like 99% of the

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,210
audience which is expected since we are

00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,490
here and how many of you are actual

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,599
contributors to open source and somehow

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,920
I don't know by submitting full request

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,480
now it's not too bad actually so you

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,829
don't know really need my talk you can

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:41,160
leave them right now ok that's nice

00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:42,719
so let's say about a 50% of you are

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,300
already contributing to open source this

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:48,300
is kind of expected since we are here at

00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:51,000
the Python conference anyway what I'm

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,969
going to do today is to tell you my

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,600
story my personal story with open source

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:00,210
the idea is to of course try to inspire

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,359
people who are willing or would like to

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:06,360
start contributing to open source also I

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,310
would kind of give you a perspective

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,590
from the point of view of a company who

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,780
has never been into open source and at

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,390
some point because some weirdo in the

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,299
company decides to adopt open source the

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,280
the company follows along and starts

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:24,000
using open source within its own

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,250
workflow and products so let's start I

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,549
am a number of things in my company that

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:32,400
called me the weirdo because I in their

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:33,990
opinion I just do too much stuff I have

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,180
too much stuff in my hands with it which

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,570
is probably true I had this the point in

00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,850
time but we will get back to this slide

00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:44,820
in a few minutes what really matters

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,970
here is that I started my professional

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,619
career back in 1991

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:56,759
so yes I'm that old and but then it was

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,369
a ms-dos developer basically because but

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:04,040
then back then even Windows wasn't yet I

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:07,920
think and we I was basically doing

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,220
she-she-she language in that in C

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,940
language staff in a mess

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:18,450
and some other environments and what

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,340
we're doing our company was starting a

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,050
building Windows software back then but

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,960
but then Windows wasn't really a thing

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:27,480
and when we were going and introduced

00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,730
our software to computer shops blenders

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,740
and users they were like why are you

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,600
doing Windows and nobody uses Windows

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,250
now nowadays everybody's doing is using

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,080
ms-dos so you you get the idea of the

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,340
environment and the ecosystem we were

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,310
working with back then

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,710
so we basically we're two of us two

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:50,220
cofounders of a small company in back in

00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:53,460
1991 nobody course used to call it new

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,700
company startups but in retrospective I

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:59,280
we could call it a startup and what we

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,740
were doing was right one of us was

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,230
writing code in the office the other guy

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:06,120
was jumping on a car and back then the

00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,360
software by the way was sold in boxes

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,150
actually cardboard boxes and the

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,360
software was in floppy disks and usually

00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:19,320
I guess you know what properties keys

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,780
and basically I had my trunk in the car

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,720
filled with boxes and they would go

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,520
around in Italy and try to sell my

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,530
software to computer shops computer

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,260
shops would then sell the software to

00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,660
end users right so the next week I would

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,030
be coding while my colleague was was

00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,980
going around in Italy and selling our

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,780
software and we were just copying the

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,209
floppy disks from our computers and

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,459
putting them into the boxing and feeling

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,320
the trunk of our car

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:50,370
that's how software workers were

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:54,330
produced was produced back then that's

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,670
been going on for a while for a number

00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,350
we actually windows became a thing

00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,990
actually people were using it our

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,760
software was successful probably because

00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,900
we were the first but then doing that

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,020
kind of thing so we were really

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,930
strategically well position and to get

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,709
the market our not to share in the

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,870
Italian market anyway yes over time we

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:21,180
did a lot of stuff basically nowadays

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,730
our main product is and invoicing an

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,770
account

00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:27,640
application it is a desktop application

00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:29,980
I wrote it a number of years ago

00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,950
actually and it is a c-sharp application

00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,050
so yes I'm a c-sharp guy at a Python

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:40,510
conference but the thing is that at some

00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:42,820
point the direction we were I mean I was

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,890
just sitting in my comfort zone building

00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,810
my staff my software I was very

00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,900
comfortable comfortable with the

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,570
technology and the stock I was using we

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,740
were using Microsoft Technology basic

00:04:52,570 --> 00:05:00,280
basically we were dotnet a shop in late

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:04,120
I should say in the 2000 stuff like that

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,670
2010 and at some point I really wanted

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,970
to try something new at that at that

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:12,310
point the technology over actually the

00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,990
market was requiring us to write mobile

00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,090
applications and web applications

00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,870
because people using our app on the

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:22,690
desktop they wanted to also use a you

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:26,920
know printing voices or do inventory

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,900
stuff where when they were moving around

00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:32,920
on the mobile applications and on the

00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:35,410
web so we were to write some server some

00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,570
probably API that our desktop

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,820
applications could talk to and that's

00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:42,420
when I wanted to try something new I

00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:45,490
wanted to get out of my comfort zone and

00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:52,090
those were the years when Steve Ballmer

00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:54,820
in Microsoft was basically 2001 Steve

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,850
Ballmer went and say that open-source

00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:04,030
was not trustworthy that's what the

00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:07,570
sorry that really didn't resonate with

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:10,000
me I was again a dotnet GI working with

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,160
the Microsoft ecosystem but that really

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,260
didn't I didn't really like that

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,240
approach to the approach matter was

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:21,340
taking to the to the solution of

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,260
problems such as you say the strategy

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,330
that we are looking at so I started

00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:28,120
looking at something else what was going

00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:30,400
to happen outside of micro fold on and

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,589
that's when I started looking at Python

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,619
and the open source world etc

00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:39,309
long story short at some point I was

00:06:35,619 --> 00:06:41,289
quite proficient with Python and the

00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:45,789
guys in my company were really concerned

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:48,279
about my the direction I was taking back

00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:51,599
then they weren't really sure the idea

00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:57,509
basically was I was wasting our time but

00:06:51,599 --> 00:07:00,849
yes I went to Europe Python in I think

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:04,149
2012 it was in Florence and I went there

00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:07,449
with a talk about how to build a REST

00:07:04,149 --> 00:07:10,179
API sweet flask now mind you I was a

00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:11,979
c-sharp guy talking for the first time

00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:14,349
in English by the way at the Eurofighter

00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,949
conference and doing a workshop about

00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:20,559
building a REST API with flask so if any

00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,779
of you was listening to the nearly proxy

00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:26,319
that I taught before this one he was

00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:28,119
about named programming that talk really

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,969
resonates with me because when I want a

00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:33,789
one I went there to a Europe I thought I

00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:35,889
was ready Navy and I mean I was speaking

00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:38,829
to Python programmers about something

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:43,919
which was totally new to me what I was

00:07:38,829 --> 00:07:47,139
doing there really was try to validate

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,779
ask him for validation about my idea on

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,119
how a REST API was supposed to be

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:54,549
working and how I would solve that

00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:57,369
problem so what it wasn't really me

00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:59,259
going there and teaching people but more

00:07:57,369 --> 00:08:01,329
like people I'm doing this I'm doing

00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,389
this this way what do you think about

00:08:01,329 --> 00:08:07,689
this and in my world in the sharp and

00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,789
dotnet world something I did really I've

00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:11,919
never seen something like that and the

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,079
reason I was doing that probably because

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,939
the open source and the Python community

00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:21,059
was so much what coming to me I felt

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:29,739
safe to do something like that in public

00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:31,779
now at the end of the talk people came

00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:33,519
to me and said look what you're doing is

00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:34,300
amazing why don't you release this stuff

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,029
as open source

00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:39,219
now the framework for building REST API

00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,709
so was already in place I was I

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:44,649
basically it was ready but it wasn't an

00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:46,209
open source so I went back to my company

00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,759
we talked about it at the

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:51,179
end of the day we released our REST API

00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,290
framework as an open-source framework I

00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:55,119
don't know if you know about it not

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:58,240
really important I just want to show you

00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:58,959
that we went are released something as

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,910
open-source

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,929
this is something that is based on flask

00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:10,439
and you can basically very easily deploy

00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:10,439
REST API stays on top of flask basically

00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:16,179
it is a mildly successful framework I

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,259
would say people are using it all over

00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,999
the world

00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:24,879
you can say but the number of stars that

00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:26,679
there is average adoption of course it's

00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,529
not Jango I mean or it's not flask

00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:32,079
itself but it is working very well and

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:34,839
then after Eve I also released the

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,290
Cerberus which is a data validation

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,149
framework it is actually if dependency

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,850
since everybody does data validation

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:45,759
even rest frameworks need to do data

00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,220
validation so he had to do it I had to

00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:50,470
do the this stuff and since I was doing

00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,470
it I might as well release it as open

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,769
source again so Cerberus was born now

00:09:53,470 --> 00:10:01,179
look at the github stars here they are

00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:03,009
like five times less than is but a point

00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:05,559
I want to make is that actually Cerberus

00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:07,990
is doing three times the download and

00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:10,480
the user base then Eve itself

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:11,799
so one destined for this talk is

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,379
probably not very important that he is

00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:17,610
don't really look at the github stars

00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:20,049
number as an indication of the how

00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:24,220
successful the framework is there are

00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:26,649
some super cool packages on github the

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,329
help maybe ten or a few hundred stars

00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:29,889
and they are widely adopted by the

00:10:28,329 --> 00:10:34,769
community just nobody goes there and

00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:38,259
start the two star the repository and

00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:39,990
then because we were such for I mean I

00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:42,970
was having so much fun by the way

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,029
maintaining these projects in the open

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,009
source we went back to our c-sharp stock

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:49,839
and by the way in the meantime axel what

00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:51,670
kind of caching double because as you

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,429
probably know nowadays Microsoft does a

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:57,220
ton of stuff as open source and we will

00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:59,290
talk about that later so we are also

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,029
releasing of

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,880
the Ivica system has been spawning

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,070
people the communities be growing and as

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,890
you can see there are a number of

00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:12,370
projects extensions for sickle alchemy

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:15,310
for example for open API or I don't know

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:17,529
for the authentication stuff like that

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:19,779
so the community's been growing around

00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:22,149
the eve project and a number of people

00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,310
it prompted itself the evil project

00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,830
itself is like I don't know 150

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,630
contributors to the project actual code

00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:30,490
contributors but there are people

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,380
working on this extension for example

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:39,279
there are about 10 people working on it

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:41,770
so yes success we went back to c-sharp

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,750
and I'm starting to release a c-sharp

00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:46,209
and dotnet open source and now look at

00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,880
the number of stars there of course the

00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:51,490
the factor the scale factor is quite

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:55,300
different in dotnet world people are not

00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,820
really used to consuming and embracing

00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:01,810
adopting open source project as we do in

00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:03,900
the Python space but it it is happening

00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:06,160
actually people people are using this

00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,290
Italian project that you probably can't

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,480
understand anything about it but it is

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,040
just for the Italian market but in the

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,830
Italian market people are actually using

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,540
it widely just they don't even know

00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,070
there is a github and they have to go

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,860
and start it if they like it it is just

00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,980
download the package and use it in their

00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,260
own application

00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,450
so in during all this process I learned

00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:30,370
a number of things a number of very nice

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:33,070
and bad things happening to me I'm going

00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,680
to show you some of them and some of

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,089
them since most of you are already 50

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,550
percent of you are already contributors

00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:42,070
know everything about this but let's

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,200
just browse them because I have a few

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,070
consideration and things I want to share

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:51,250
with you like I did six years ago at a

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:53,709
flask talk so new feature of course my

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,660
company was shocked when people started

00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:59,290
adding features to our framework for

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,290
free now if we if we look at a project

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,720
from the company perspective we're

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,720
getting new powerful features for free

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,170
this one is very nice because document

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,940
versioning it in its essence is people

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,450
can edit a document

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:19,240
over the rest framework delete delete it

00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:21,730
yes but edit a change the document many

00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,190
times now thanks to this version you can

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:26,260
go and ask a specific version of the

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,600
document at a certain point in time you

00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,550
can even ask for the diff between the

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,610
document elect we will do with git for

00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:37,270
example this feature is super powerful

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:39,130
I didn't write one line or code about it

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,260
and as you can see by the number of file

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,440
touched by this feature it was quite a

00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:46,150
huge contributor contribution and Josh

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,520
by the way he doesn't work there anymore

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:52,650
but back then this was a contribution

00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:55,030
done by a very nice and famous company I

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,030
can't really mention it because for a

00:13:55,030 --> 00:14:00,430
secured NDA regions but let's just say

00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:02,440
that they send spaceships to the

00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,170
International Space Station and it is

00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,230
not in Asia so you probably can get an

00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,660
idea which company it is and they're

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,790
actually the spaceships they are using

00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:17,650
to send stuff to the International Space

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:20,730
Station the some part of the engineering

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:24,820
around the spaceship is actually a base

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:27,160
using I need instance to it is being

00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,030
used somehow I don't know how within the

00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:32,950
laboratory laboratories to store

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:38,980
informations about the engineering stuff

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:41,380
the design of the devices etc and of

00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,180
course bug fixes this is another very

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,220
important feature for the company

00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,440
companies seeing value in our progress

00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:50,980
in our open-source process now because

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,480
we get bug fix it for free even before

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:56,350
we know about them and we learn about

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,960
them which is how many how many how much

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,660
money we spent in 25 years in on the

00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,340
field fixing bugs that people were

00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,100
actually complaining about and we

00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:09,160
couldn't even reproduce them locally in

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,440
our closest source company now things

00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:13,000
has changed people are like look there

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,640
is a bug and this is the fix for the bug

00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,530
and so we don't I mean how nice is that

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,780
if you are a company producing software

00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:21,790
I mean not all the backs of Soviet

00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:24,910
ladies I'm still fixing bugs every

00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:27,890
single day but many of them are be I

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:30,900
don't even have to fix them

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:35,490
and this is very important in my opinion

00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:38,220
quality and longevity of a project so

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:43,410
more eyes see more that how I put it

00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:45,510
basically look at this contribution now

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,670
I'd like to contribute to the project so

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,190
I started the world through basically

00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,020
the commentation sorry not the

00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:53,970
documentation but he went and looked at

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:56,100
started looking at the docstring sword

00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:58,110
every single function and method we had

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,600
in the framework and fix that a few

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:05,150
typos I has he says actually he touched

00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:09,080
the 21 fives against and if we go and

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:12,480
let's see if I can show you yes

00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:15,540
readable yes so this guy's probably

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,760
doesn't know much about Python otherwise

00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,370
he would be fixing bug or finding I

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,230
don't know issues in my code etc but he

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,850
still wanted to contribute so he went

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,910
and started looking at the dog strings

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,830
and there were so many errors mostly

00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:32,070
because I'm not a native speaker as you

00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:36,690
can to me and so he went and fix it all

00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:39,240
this stuff as you can see just typos you

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:41,910
might say stupid things but this code

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,250
has been on github for four years so how

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,280
many people have been reading these dog

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:49,740
strings in in the lifespan of this

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,530
project and looking at the mistakes at

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,210
the typos and going like first this

00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,360
nicola guy that really doesn't know

00:16:54,210 --> 00:17:00,030
anything about english and second they

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,520
should fix it finally one guy one knife

00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,190
guy probably coming from i don't know

00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,280
the just for the enthusiasm he had in

00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:11,790
the project went a fix it is and now

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:15,120
finally after four or five years the dog

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:18,150
things are hopefully fix it or way more

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,980
fix an empty hole so i really value this

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:22,350
contribution because this is the kind of

00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:25,199
approach that somebody who wants to

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,870
start contributing to open source can do

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,090
very easily and contribute a lot of

00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:32,010
value to the project itself because when

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,270
the people like you new adopters of the

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,130
project go and look at the code don't

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:38,730
have to mess with my mistakes in the

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:40,530
docs trees so many mystics by the way so

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,580
this is a very nice

00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:48,030
sample of how even non-skilled or

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,620
probably just shy people can still start

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,510
a contribute to open source project at

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:58,140
contribute value without even touching

00:17:51,510 --> 00:18:01,080
one line of code again the community now

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,810
nowadays when I want to change something

00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,810
in the framework beat the Ephrem of

00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:09,390
servers or my c-sharp code I don't go to

00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,520
my colleagues or I go to my colleagues

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:13,920
of course but I also go to the community

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,900
I just open a ticket and I go like I

00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,460
would like to implement a fluent API for

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,280
example for this project what do you

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,800
guys think about it so suddenly it's not

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,950
just five or six of us in our office

00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,350
it's probably tens or hundreds or

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,290
sometimes thousands of people talking

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,630
about a design feature so we have a lot

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:36,750
more feedback about that how powerful

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,160
and important that is of course it also

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:40,620
means that you have to spend a lot of

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,920
time talking to people which has a cost

00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,960
yes can be taxing but it is still worth

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,880
it in my opinion because at the end of

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,680
the day the design is probably more

00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,230
sound there are new ideas coming from

00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,480
people who are not on the same race as

00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:57,300
we are in the office and can contribute

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:01,800
innovative new and fresh ideas and

00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:04,980
approaches for example by the way here I

00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:07,860
was about working on this new API and

00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:09,900
this Pedro guy came and told me look go

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,810
and look at the MongoDB implementation

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:15,630
they already have fluent API so probably

00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:18,150
a good idea by might be look at what has

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:21,870
been has been already done in this space

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:24,120
and honestly I didn't think about it so

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:26,820
it was a good idea I went and and was

00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:32,340
inspired by the MongoDB implementation

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:36,000
of this particular API another important

00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:38,490
aspect that people usually don't really

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,350
consider are the language and code

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:46,370
cultural barriers so not just how good

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:48,930
are you speaking English but also the

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,929
cultural differences that are around the

00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:54,240
world so somebody from the eastern Asia

00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:57,629
or maybe from Russia might open a ticket

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,970
about a bag MB especially from the

00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:02,190
Eastern Europe he it would be probably

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:05,549
very direct like look there is a bug

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,799
here fix it somebody asks from Western

00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:09,720
Europe for the same bag will go like hey

00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,639
you know very nice framework thank you I

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,799
really love it we are using it in

00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:16,559
production thank you thank you thank you

00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,080
there is a bug can you probably go there

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,720
and look at it fix it so you see very

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,480
different approaches to the same exact

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,600
bad the first one might come across to

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,879
me as somebody not really nice somebody

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,830
Adam really feel like happy maybe I look

00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:34,529
at the bug from the Western Europe and

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,509
Europe guy because he's so nice but

00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:40,379
actually the two people have the same

00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:43,619
problem and the same and the East Europe

00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:45,659
guy is as nice as the Western Europe guy

00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:47,190
it is just a cultural difference they

00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:48,749
approach they take the language in a

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,330
different they think different ways

00:20:48,749 --> 00:20:53,279
probably but they are asking for the

00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:55,649
same solution right I don't know if I

00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,980
get my point across what I want to say

00:20:55,649 --> 00:21:00,659
that people all over the world are

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,029
speaking approaching to problems

00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:06,480
solution in different ways you have to

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:08,159
learn and deal and and also understand

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,379
that they communicate in different ways

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,690
and also there is a language barrier

00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:13,740
real dry language better because we

00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,299
don't speak English I don't speak

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,999
English well this guy doesn't speak

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:21,029
English well and Amedeo is obviously a

00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:23,820
Latin guy he is actually Italian he is

00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:27,179
not a native English speaker either so

00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:29,700
sometimes it really gets weird but you

00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,940
have to process all of this I make sure

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,409
you understand everything is the context

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,059
very well

00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:41,669
and speaking of downsides maintenance

00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:44,369
maintenance of our open source project

00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:47,279
can really become a burden it actually

00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:50,700
is for my own open source projects right

00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,830
now anyway we have well actually way

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,749
less than these open tickets but just

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,850
because I have about closing tickets

00:21:54,749 --> 00:22:00,379
which are older than one here because

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:04,200
they couldn't handle all of that alone

00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:06,020
but at some time at some point in time

00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,600
when your project

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,520
becomes successful you start having just

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,040
too many tickets you can deal with so

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,560
you have to really you every single

00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,360
minute you get an email probably as I'm

00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,450
speaking right now I'm getting emails

00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,310
from people that are wants a new feature

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,190
or have some issue with the framework

00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:28,410
ask for help and so it can really become

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,420
taxing you feel responsible for these

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,220
people there is some guy in Dubai who

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,960
has a problem with my framework then I

00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,820
really would like to help him but right

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,950
now I have to do this and that because

00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:39,840
I'm making money there and this is free

00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:42,600
activity I need to do that on Saturday

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,940
morning maybe on Sunday evening I've

00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,370
been doing all of these for many years

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:49,230
and I can show you when we have a family

00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:53,130
with three kids and a dog

00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:56,810
etc it really becomes taxing so that's

00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,710
probably a negative and you if you are

00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,330
contributing to an operation so many of

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,950
you are already contributors so probably

00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,690
know everything about it at some point

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,150
probably you got stressed because the

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,940
maintainer wasn't really looking looking

00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:10,860
at your ticket so you go and look at the

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,430
code and fix it yourself and then

00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,540
contribute it with a pull request just

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,600
because you were stressed that the

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:24,750
maintainer wasn't looking at the Alysha

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:27,000
anybody notice okay that's good and if

00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:29,820
you are into open source for making

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,050
money or if you think that open source

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:36,630
can give you money this is what I'm

00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,550
doing from open source on patreon right

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:41,310
now but actually I have four

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:43,410
contributors sorry for partying sighs

00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:46,260
they call them right now so I'm making

00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:48,810
four bucks a month for my open source

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:49,950
activity so if you want to get it open

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:53,340
source for the money

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:56,310
well maybe reconsider that and find some

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,230
alternative ways to make money I mean

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,540
there are very successful projects who

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,340
are doing a good money in the open

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,610
source but you really need to get there

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,970
if you want to make the money like not

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,920
5,000 stars maybe 100,000 stars then

00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,350
maybe you're starting to see some money

00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,490
coming from this because people will we

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,010
look at the project read the

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,170
documentation adopt it make money over

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,520
it and maybe even think yes

00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,190
need to contribute to this project

00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,570
because it is so cool but they then

00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:31,470
somehow they forget to do that right so

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:33,960
you need to get creative for example I

00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,150
don't know if any of you knows about

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,010
talk Python podcast is a very nice

00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:42,540
podcast in the Python space or run by

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:45,330
Michael Kennedy and he he asked me if I

00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,910
wanted to actually produce a course

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,370
about the evil framework and he would

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:54,540
sell it on his platform I did that it

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:56,910
was very hard for me to do that and but

00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:58,890
in the end there I'm getting some more

00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:00,840
money more than the 4 bucks a more time

00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,450
I'm making from the part from party on

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,070
campaign so if you want to make money in

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:09,120
open source it there are ways but you

00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:11,970
are really to work hard together and we

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,590
will see that also I'm making mana

00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:15,480
collateral money from my open source

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,430
activity but not just that it is from

00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:22,050
the open source contributions with which

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:24,630
unfortunately are very low so let's look

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,540
at the consequences of my story when I

00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:30,780
started looking at Python and the open

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:33,870
source I was just a very shy introvert C

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:36,270
sharp and previously C developer working

00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:37,980
all day on in my office and then a 5:00

00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:42,900
p.m. I would just leave and go home and

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:46,500
stay with my wife then somebody I really

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:50,100
I went to Europe Python I release the

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:53,910
EVAs open source somebody I don't know

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:55,980
if it was by put lock or unlock went and

00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:59,220
posted the framework on Eve ona hacker

00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:05,670
genius back in the day and that's when

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:08,640
they the wheel started to you know to

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,910
just move too fast for me in one day I

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,530
got like 1,000 stars on github people

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,720
started emailing me contributing pull

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,190
request the death day I became an

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,460
open-source maintainer basically until

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:24,990
then people really have not caring about

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:28,050
my open source project that inter

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:30,660
started I should say I went back to

00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:31,720
speaking and I started talking about my

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,940
open source peril

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,919
people were actually asking me to go and

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,690
talk to their conferences about my

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,559
open-source project or my activity in

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,299
general get SPI I'm have been talking

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,279
about a number of topics but mainly

00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,630
about my own open-source project but

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,450
speaking for me was something totally

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:52,750
new again it might not appear right now

00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:54,820
but I am really a shy person so for me

00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:58,960
going out and speaking about my things

00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:01,809
my story it was really hard for me to do

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:06,000
in the beginning so yes even if you're

00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:08,139
shy introvert you might be a very good

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,460
surely better than me speaker in the

00:27:08,139 --> 00:27:15,760
future if you want to try that and then

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,740
because I was doing a REST API stuff on

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,750
the on the web and my framework was

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,230
being adopted by many companies

00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:25,240
I started getting consulted contract

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:28,000
work just because people wanted me to go

00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,159
and for example here in any board three

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,260
years ago I went to the universities

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,159
because they were using even their own

00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:38,139
projects and they got in touch with me

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,450
and said look if you come here for one

00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:42,549
week we can you probably can do the work

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,830
we will do in six months so just come

00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:46,779
here we pay you and you fix the project

00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:49,899
for us and we look and we move forward

00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:51,880
and I did that was I had a lot of fun by

00:27:49,899 --> 00:27:55,809
the way what was great think about that

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:59,889
going and do to do contract work for on

00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:03,760
your own open-source framework how Mayta

00:27:59,889 --> 00:28:05,889
is that very nice I love that it's been

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,289
happening since then a few times so

00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:11,590
money for my open-source project finally

00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:13,960
yeah and also teaching I've been

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:17,620
teaching a Python in general not just my

00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,990
open-source project I started creating a

00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:22,840
communities for example this local

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,929
community in my own City

00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,720
so we every month we meet we I try to

00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:32,230
encourage people to start speaking at

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,510
these small events maybe we have 40

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:36,909
people and then people start getting

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,970
confidence with this and maybe started

00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:43,629
going and speaking at Korea conferences

00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:44,630
and not just a meetups etc and this is

00:28:43,629 --> 00:28:46,730
fun

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:49,100
because at the end of the day three

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,560
years ago I might so came back to me and

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:54,350
for the last ten years I've been working

00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:56,840
50% of C sharp and 50% of Python I still

00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:59,540
do the to this day I still worked a lot

00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:03,320
on seashell space and they wanted to

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:05,420
award me for my work in the developer

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,550
technologies but the story the real

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:11,120
story was that I was trying to flee from

00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:13,730
that ecosystem and going again you know

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
all about it already I went and started

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,340
working on Python I didn't really want

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,070
to work in that ecosystem anymore and

00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,710
again micro very slowly but they kind of

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,130
catch it up with me and now they are a

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,540
totally awesome open-source company I

00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:31,370
probably many of you are using Xcode

00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,200
Visual Studio code as a day of text

00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:35,630
editor they are the main contributor to

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,400
github they have a number of main thing

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:40,130
open source project I got this award

00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:42,350
from them and every once a year we get

00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:45,170
to go to the Microsoft headquarters in

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,480
Seattle and I get to talk with the

00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:50,330
actual developers who are making that

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,620
framework net code etc and it is funny

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,650
because when I started working with

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:57,470
Frasca open-source and I consider what

00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:00,140
the code behind the framework I was

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,850
using for me was a total revelation of

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:03,980
how powerful open-source will be and now

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,410
speaking to these guys they are so

00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:09,890
excited as excited as I was ten years

00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:12,530
ago they are so happy that they now can

00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:15,830
embrace open-source and work on them on

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:17,960
it and seeing them so excited about it

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,730
I know that Microsoft isn't going back

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,190
if you're afraid that maxvill will be

00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:25,910
going back someday your try to trap you

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:28,910
into the ecosystem as they used to do

00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:30,770
years ago don't be afraid max what is a

00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,800
totally new company and because I saw I

00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:36,530
see the guys working on the on the on

00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,540
the actual project I know that you can

00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,150
stop them anymore you can't put them in

00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:44,390
a cage anymore as they used to to be

00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:48,620
working to work in in the past and so

00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:51,110
kind of funny also I got an award for

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:54,620
 DB etc are not really important

00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:56,990
but and this is important actually so

00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,539
because I'm speaking because I have open

00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,609
source

00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:01,320
softer and every time I put a line of

00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:03,239
code on github I know that there are

00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:05,729
probably hundreds or thousands of people

00:31:03,239 --> 00:31:09,619
reviewing my code I really have to do my

00:31:05,729 --> 00:31:12,210
job at the best I can perform right

00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:15,119
which usually means the people we still

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:17,729
find the issues with my code and review

00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:20,249
it and fix the bugs again our complain

00:31:17,729 --> 00:31:22,139
that I could adopt a different solution

00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:27,330
but it is okay this is a slide from

00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:30,200
Aggie torque I did last year not just

00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:33,690
don't look at the code but in order to

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,210
understand get I mean I use git every

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,210
day I I'm on Team projects pull requests

00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:42,599
rebase etc I went and started speaking

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,849
about how I use if did but in order to

00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:47,789
talk about it you really need to counter

00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:51,359
the tool so I I have to learn it even

00:31:47,789 --> 00:31:53,519
more than I I know hit just because I

00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,919
need to go and teach it so basically for

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,840
me this means learning every single day

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,690
every single day and still spend one

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,570
hour every morning really early in the

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:07,409
morning just to learn because I need to

00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:09,419
know the tools every you all do that but

00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:11,820
because if you go in front of the over

00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,139
public be it by speaking or because you

00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,169
have an open source project we have to

00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:19,259
maintain it you really have to do

00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:23,549
learning very well networking services

00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:25,919
deal as the as the French say nowadays I

00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:29,519
know a lot of people in the Python space

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,320
and the is extremely powerful I can

00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,200
count the number of times that somebody

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,239
from across the world has been helping

00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,210
me with something that has nothing to do

00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:41,249
with with the actual open source

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,109
framework maybe I need to fly to Dubai

00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:46,649
for work for a contract water and

00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:49,320
somebody from Dubai will I don't know

00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:51,269
help me or even at take me to their

00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,429
house and stuff like that so networking

00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:56,460
is super powerful and because I'm so

00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:59,039
grateful because of open-source I got to

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,960
meet so many cool people and guys and

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,849
gangers all around the world it is

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:09,549
extremely powerful and useful also so

00:33:05,849 --> 00:33:12,369
now I do all of these stuff

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:15,820
and open source to me really rocking my

00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:17,799
water totally changed the way I work my

00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,769
workflows that people have worked with

00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:25,529
is not again not for five people anymore

00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:25,529
but thousands and thousands of people

00:33:27,179 --> 00:33:33,489
again I encourage you to do the same or

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,980
try to to follow the same route but you

00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:38,559
should start very easily take it easy

00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,200
like the guy who contributed the dog

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,779
stream fix this is my first pull request

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,869
in six year ago probably probably seven

00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:49,419
years ago now it was just a fixed to do

00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:53,159
to the documentation again so there are

00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:56,230
opportunities opportunities out there

00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,359
but if you contribute a pool request

00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:01,749
make sure that you do your homework for

00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:04,779
example if you fix a back but you don't

00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:06,759
have a test for the bug fix probably

00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:09,790
your pool request is not going to be

00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:11,530
accepted people want to you to

00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,780
contribute a proper test for every

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,760
single fix you contribute or feature

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,579
account it would just an example it

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,559
depends of the project of course here

00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:22,299
this particular pool request has been

00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:26,169
there for six months sitting because

00:34:22,299 --> 00:34:28,409
there was no no contribute no test for

00:34:26,169 --> 00:34:32,379
the for the feature so I couldn't add it

00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:34,899
either I go and write the test I said if

00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:37,179
I have the time but of course the guy

00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:40,329
contributing the future is the more

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:42,520
entitled one he knows what he's doing

00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:45,639
why he's doing that and he should

00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,440
contribute the test so if you can't

00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,599
contribute the test probably it's not

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,230
yet the time to go and open up or

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,960
request to your project there are test

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:59,950
Suites by the way documentation are the

00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,680
two feature where were probably 90% of

00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:04,329
poor request died because you contribute

00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:08,250
the fix-it contribute the future no

00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:10,720
documentation no test is a no-go and

00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:13,690
then you complain because your protocol

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,270
was not accepted most of the time that's

00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:19,060
what happens

00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:21,490
and also sometimes you do everything as

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:24,190
yours you are supposed to do but still

00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:26,200
things don't go as planned this is a

00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,780
poor request I did let's go and look at

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:33,280
it because I suspect it is still sitting

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:36,130
there so this is a dotnet a c-sharp

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,770
contribution a pull request to align a

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:41,260
nice project to the latest version of

00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:45,310
the framework I contributed this poor

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:48,910
request 70 months ago as you can see a

00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:50,950
number of people once these poor

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:54,280
requests to be merged because it is very

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:56,640
nice so and by the way this guy for

00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:01,360
example the AEK Miller is a Microsoft

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,280
inter developer so basically this

00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,869
project which is open source is being

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,640
used within Microsoft probably and

00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:08,500
Microsoft guys who wanted to be merged

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,240
would really appreciate that we merged

00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:14,230
it but still the maintainer is not

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:17,110
merging and basically this is I suspect

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:21,580
that it is a dead project one year ago

00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:22,900
the last yes exactly one year ago so

00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,970
probably these guys doing something else

00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,410
with his life or just abandon the

00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:28,750
project which is very common effort

00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:32,290
early in open-source and we are now

00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:37,810
considering working it releasing deeper

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:40,270
equal basically start anew this is

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:44,200
actually the name was for the new

00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:45,430
project came out during this talk I did

00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,830
the Munich a few months ago somebody

00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:50,650
arrested a the hand said because it was

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:52,540
like I don't know this is such a cool

00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:54,580
name how can i for can release a new

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:58,180
project with a similar name and it was

00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:59,560
like deeper equal very nice name but I

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,900
don't really want to fault the project

00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,119
because forking is bad the usually you

00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,660
don't want to fork a project and start a

00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:09,460
new a new project cetera so I'm still

00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,770
hoping it will merge but the point here

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:13,810
is that you do everything fine you

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:15,609
contribute you open a pull request you

00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,740
have the test you have documentation and

00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:21,520
still there is a chance that it won't

00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:24,910
get merged it's okay it happens just go

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,050
I had a go forward and maybe contributed

00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:28,849
to another project there might be

00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:31,579
reasons that go beyond the euro

00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:33,859
skill and your own and what you did

00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:35,720
there are reasons why probably there are

00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:37,569
some guys right now complaining that

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,239
they poor requested to the II project

00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:50,539
have not been murdered yet so it's okay

00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:53,599
it happens what am i doing right and so

00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:55,460
again martini poor requested there is

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,759
what I find to be a called cognitive

00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:02,630
bias there are so many contributors

00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:05,299
wanna be but they are intimidated they

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:10,880
feel like to be open source contributory

00:38:05,299 --> 00:38:15,380
to be so skilled so cool so capable and

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,380
as marked but the truth is it is which

00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:22,249
that it isn't true and also there are so

00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:24,739
many open source maintenance that really

00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:26,420
can't wait for more contributors to join

00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:28,910
the product they project they are

00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,220
willing to review your code help you out

00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:35,180
if something is wrong with with your

00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:37,549
poorest of your contribution so we have

00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,430
a 50% of contributors here in the room

00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:43,460
let's make it a 70 percent 80 percent

00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:47,960
will be totally also and the open source

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:50,930
community as a community as a group who

00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:54,799
would have so many advantages over over

00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:57,019
that so many projects would progress

00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:58,819
faster just because of new people are

00:38:57,019 --> 00:39:02,079
contributing and by the way contributing

00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:05,420
might just mean fix the documentation

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,539
again fix the dog strings add new tests

00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,369
or I don't know change the colors review

00:39:08,539 --> 00:39:12,289
the design of the web pages you don't

00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:14,749
really have to go and fix the super

00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:19,029
important bug that nobody can nobody has

00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:22,789
been fix it has fixed it for many years

00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:26,029
so there is no luck in becoming an open

00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:28,190
source developer you don't become an

00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:29,089
honest or an open source developer

00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,380
because of luck

00:39:29,089 --> 00:39:36,410
it takes wheel and grid and also a

00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:39,810
strong desire to learn new things and to

00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:44,280
put yourself under review validation

00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:46,380
and just open yourself to the public the

00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,930
good news is that anybody can become an

00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:51,990
open-source code review tous contributor

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,640
this is not my saying and this is from a

00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,970
telco lino who is a good friend of mine

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,790
he's also one of the knowledge as

00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:01,890
members of the Technical Committee a

00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:05,520
superstar in the JavaScript space maybe

00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:08,820
you know about him so here there are a

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,030
few links if you want to find some good

00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:14,100
ideas on where to start you can find the

00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:16,380
slides online so you don't have to yeah

00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:18,870
also you can't actually read those links

00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:21,870
so go online and find my I will tweet

00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:23,670
about these links later on and you if

00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:25,620
you go on speaker back and look for

00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:29,040
Nicola Adachi you'll find the guys so

00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:32,040
you can get the links but my advice is

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,440
start from your own tool chain for

00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,260
example here I was writing an article

00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:40,110
for code magazine about using Python in

00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:43,680
a visual studio by the way visual studio

00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:45,660
also has a fantastic support for Python

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,090
nowadays and again this is because of

00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,520
Microsoft changing their mind and going

00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,500
the open-source full monty basically and

00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,810
as I was writing the article I was

00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:57,240
reviewing the official documentation for

00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:59,220
for Visual Studio and the fan found a

00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,830
number of errors or typos stuff like

00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:05,160
that so I just went and contributed to

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:08,370
the the fixes to the documentation of

00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,140
Visual Studio so even if I'm I might say

00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:12,720
eight years old the open source

00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:14,310
developer I still go and fix Visual

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,040
Studio documentation for a separ so now

00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:20,310
I mean I can't claim to be a contributor

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,820
to Visual Studio in a way or another but

00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:26,250
it is just it just came out of necessity

00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:29,520
because I was working on that I found an

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:31,470
error why not fix it you probably have a

00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,050
number of issues with with your own

00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:36,540
tools with the documentation as you read

00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,700
it just go and fix it contributory this

00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,930
is a very nice a smart way to start

00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:45,570
contributing to open source this is it

00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:48,210
here you find my links if you want to

00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,590
get in touch with me again the links are

00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:51,390
going to be on

00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:55,580
on speaker back they already are

00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:55,580
actually so thank you

00:42:02,569 --> 00:42:11,900
so is anyone have a question okay thank

00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:11,900
you

00:42:14,609 --> 00:42:21,690
based on your experience what are the

00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:25,170
best let's call it information channels

00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:28,079
to announce project or get get more

00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:31,680
people involved into the project well in

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,390
my own experience going to conferences

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,680
for example and talk about the project

00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:39,450
now there is again a connect this idea

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,359
that in order to get your tork approved

00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:44,880
that you need to be a superstar already

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,460
force totally false because when I went

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,470
to Europe I thought I was a c-sharp guy

00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,859
pretending to talk about Python

00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:55,470
I was sure nobody will absolutely vote

00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:58,920
for my talk and in the end the talk was

00:42:55,470 --> 00:43:01,829
accepted I had a 90 minute talk all for

00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,380
me at your Python so it was totally

00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:06,359
awesome and shocking so that's one way

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,940
of course at the simple fact that you

00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:11,609
put your project on github helps a lot

00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:14,190
because if you do your homework well

00:43:11,609 --> 00:43:16,829
people would find out one advice I

00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:19,800
always give to people asking is don't

00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:23,190
wait for your project to be 100% ready

00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,369
if you ever study if you have something

00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:29,400
that a prototype it is already working

00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:31,560
kind of words just recently a brazilian

00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,410
Brazilian guy released an open-source

00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,930
framework is called web or something

00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:39,660
like that anybody knows about it right

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:42,780
so it's a fantastic framework for doing

00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,339
basically a successor to pretend to be a

00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,790
successful - flask or something like

00:43:44,339 --> 00:43:50,069
that super fast and the promoter is no

00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:52,740
way already it is it isn't ready at all

00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:54,990
but it has some documentation good

00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:57,329
documentation online excelent

00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,010
performance the guy went on github and

00:43:57,329 --> 00:44:01,380
posted it somebody has to pick it up the

00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:04,440
project and went on reddit and posted it

00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,599
and now the the framework is like with

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:08,790
my story with here the same happening

00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,700
with this guy so the first advice I will

00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:14,140
give you is put your lamp project on

00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,789
github write some

00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:19,029
documentation even just a readme with a

00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:21,279
snippet validate your the idea make sure

00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:22,809
that people try and see if you are doing

00:44:21,279 --> 00:44:24,970
something interesting if it is

00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:26,769
interesting somehow people we found out

00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:32,079
about it we'll find out about it your

00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:34,359
best ally probably is Google the SERP so

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:36,400
you know go on get up get habit is very

00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:38,140
strong go on Google wrestle your project

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,910
will be found and then try to talk to

00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:41,740
the people around you and go to

00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:44,980
conferences might be a good idea maybe

00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:49,390
write a blog post about it and post it

00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:53,079
on I'm not really I don't I don't think

00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:54,849
that posting your own project on Hacker

00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,690
News already it is a good idea really

00:44:54,849 --> 00:45:00,130
just wait for the people to post it on

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,609
their own initiative

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:06,369
that's probably what works best because

00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:09,670
people are going to go to to go like um

00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:14,859
this guy is self promoting itself not

00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:16,779
really appreciated usually okay sorry we

00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:18,940
don't have a tie so if only question

00:45:16,779 --> 00:45:21,339
won't talk only crop with culture after

00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:24,009
session there's like thank you Mike

00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:26,090
Rogers would pretend so on for orbiter

00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:32,059
talk again thank you goodbye

00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:32,059
