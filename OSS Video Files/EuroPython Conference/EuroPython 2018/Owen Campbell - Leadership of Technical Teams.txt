Description: 
	Leadership of Technical Teams
[EuroPython 2018 - Talk - 2018-07-25 - Moorfoot]
[Edinburgh, UK]

By Owen Campbell

Over the years, I've led, and been a member of, numerous technical teams on a wide variety of projects. Based on that experience, this talk will describe my personal observations on the role of the leader in that sort of team.

The talk will be in 5 sections:


Introduction - A bit about my background so you can judge whether to bother staying for the rest.

Authority - Where it comes from and the challenges you might face depending on the answer.
Priorities - What should you be focussing upon?
Style - There are many leadership styles, but what's yours and what's appropriate for technical teams?
Process - What's your role in defining and managing process?



There is no prior knowledge or experience required whatsoever. The talk is aimed equally at anyone  considering a leadership role for the first time or who has been doing so for many years.

	00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,970
it's a personal talk in that what what I

00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,620
want the what I want to show you is some

00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,780
of the observations that I've made over

00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,700
the years from the various teams that

00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,660
I've either been a member of and been

00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,400
led by someone else

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,410
and and those teams we're where I've

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,300
been its leader it is a combination of

00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,130
things I've seen done well and things

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,720
I've done seen done very badly indeed

00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,579
and I'm gonna give you no clue as to

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,380
which is which and which were done by me

00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:37,990
of course I can't control that one that

00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:40,840
way right bit of introduction to myself

00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:43,000
that the weird signs on the right on

00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,620
these slides would have been my speaker

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,660
notes if this would being done on my

00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:48,070
laptop so just ignore the yellow blobs

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,900
and I'll try and remember what I was

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,610
going to say so just a little

00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,140
introduction about myself that will

00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:54,580
allow you to decide whether you want to

00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,290
bother stay into the for the rest of it

00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:59,290
that's a machine that I learned to

00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:01,030
program on back in 1981 which tells you

00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:03,280
a little something about how old I might

00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,900
be I've probably learned everything I

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,070
needed to know about programming on that

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:12,340
machine I'm not sure I've learnt a great

00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:14,890
deal since to be perfectly honest that

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:17,200
if you're old enough to recognize it was

00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,870
the logo of what was at the time one of

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,290
the biggest employers in the UK and I

00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:25,810
joined I see I in 1990 as a young

00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,430
graduate engineer back in those days I

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,350
was an electrical engineer so the sort

00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,710
of projects I was running were building

00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,150
high-voltage substations and

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,610
refurbishing power stations so some

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,560
really sort of heavy-duty stuff I stayed

00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,750
with them for about ten years in my

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,700
career did all sorts of engineering

00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:46,119
projects but gradually moved over to

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,500
software systems and IT systems and

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,000
eventually ended up doing the sort of

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,549
stuff that I do today my final employer

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,650
and my current employer is this

00:01:54,549 --> 00:02:01,960
fine-looking gentleman here I started

00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:04,390
working for myself in 2001 and as a

00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,430
freelance programmer developer basically

00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,009
if anybody's willing to pay my day rate

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:11,800
I'll probably do it for them within

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,080
reason and in that time I've worked for

00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,740
all sorts of organizations from housing

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,570
associations to hedge funds

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,440
the hospitals and and and everything in

00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:25,430
between but I want to tell you a couple

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,380
of more things about myself firstly for

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:32,090
15 years and I've only just recently

00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:35,090
stopped I was a manager within the Scout

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:37,190
Association so I wasn't the sort of

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,280
leader that takes young people out

00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:44,210
camping I was one of the managers that

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,490
those adults report to and I did various

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:48,500
roles in that organization at various

00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,560
levels of seniority and the last one

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,870
that just stepped down from I had twelve

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,700
hundred and fifty young people that I

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:58,930
was responsible for and a team of about

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,700
two hundred and fifty adult volunteers

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,200
and then more recently and this is

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,290
actually the reason I stepped down from

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,750
it this shiny new logo is the logo of

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:13,190
the UK Python association that was

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:16,070
formed back in 2017 and I'm now one of

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:19,460
its trustees and we are gradually taking

00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:21,680
over the running of PyCon UK and looking

00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:24,800
to expand the the sphere of what we do

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,420
from within that charity as well and I

00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,550
like that logo so much that I'm going to

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:30,830
use it on here so when I don't want you

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,800
to be looking at the screen and I don't

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,780
have any other better slides but why why

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,440
do I want to tell you about the time I

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:41,090
spent with Scouts and and the time I'm

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,400
going to be spending with the UK Python

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,890
Association and this brings me to my

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,260
first point I am a firm believer that

00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,720
leadership skills are just like any

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,990
other skill they can be learned they can

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,340
be dependent and they can be improved

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,690
I've often heard it said that leaders

00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,600
are born not made

00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,760
and I fundamentally and absolutely

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,250
disagree with that statement these are

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,310
skills like any other and they must be

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,290
practiced in order for them to improve

00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,750
the reason I took those roles in

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:14,060
Scouting was because when I started

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,340
working for myself I was a little bit

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,350
nervous that I would be losing the

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,450
opportunity to do quite so much

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,370
leadership and I went and looked for an

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:24,440
organization where I could do so

00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:28,030
voluntarily because I wanted to continue

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,030
to develop those skills

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,560
and if that means anything to you if

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,020
you're interested I thoroughly recommend

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,510
this book it's very readable it's

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,419
written a bit like a novel this the

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:46,230
author was a world champion table tennis

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,700
player and he slowly realized that if he

00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,430
looked at the top ten people in the

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,900
world I can't remember the figures but a

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:53,790
certain number of them came from the

00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,440
same town as him and when he looked a

00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,450
bit more closely he realized actually

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,090
they came within three streets of where

00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:01,860
he grew up and it was all to do with the

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,120
level of coaching that was going on at

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,590
the school and the club that he was a

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,970
member of and his book is all about

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,770
examples of where he's found exactly the

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,460
same thing going on so this is all about

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,460
the fact that any skill you care to

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,830
mention can be developed can be

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,620
practiced and can be improved probably

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,979
recommend you go and have a read of the

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,479
book and my suggestion for anybody

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:30,240
that's interested in developing their

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,820
leadership skills professionally is to

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,370
find opportunities outside of work to go

00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,560
and try them out at first you'll be

00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,180
applying what you learn at work to what

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,880
you're doing voluntarily but you'll be

00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,310
amazed at how fast it turns around the

00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,200
other way in a volunteer organization

00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,479
you're probably going to get promoted a

00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,190
lot more quickly and you'll have the

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,789
chance to be operating at a far more

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,410
senior level and I'm gonna have to do a

00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:56,639
sneak peek of what the next slide is

00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,229
because I haven't got my speaker notes

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,130
right okay what we're gonna kill me

00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,780
towards what I want to talk about next

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,940
the next point I want at them let's say

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,680
you are new into a leadership role of a

00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,060
team there's lots of different ways in

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,350
which that might have happened you could

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,780
have been promoted you could have been

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,300
voted in depends on the organization but

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,800
one of the things that I've seen in so

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:21,570
many cases is that there is very often

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,000
somebody or more than one person who

00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,400
doesn't like the fact that you're in

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,470
charge now it might because they wanted

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,570
the role it might be just that they

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,280
simply don't like you they might

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,430
disagree with the direction you want to

00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:38,190
take things can be all sorts of reasons

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,690
but it happens regularly in fact my

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,480
observation is it happens more often

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,170
than it

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,450
and that resentment is poisonous and it

00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:50,110
will kill a project if it's left

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:52,330
unchecked and so as a new leader for me

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,820
it has to be dealt with and dealt with

00:06:52,330 --> 00:07:00,160
early on and there are three strategies

00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:03,340
that I've seen work firstly show on the

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,890
love so find whoever this is flatter

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:10,720
them ask them for help

00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:12,700
find some problem that you tell them it

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,950
might be true it might not that they are

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,680
the only person that can fix for you

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:20,800
find some problem that they have that

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,020
you can fix for them but show them the

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,220
love win them round get them on your

00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:31,690
side second strategy pick a fight with

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,730
them find something where you know

00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:36,460
they're going to disagree pick the fight

00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,770
and win it make sure they know you want

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,870
it make sure everybody else around them

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,330
knows you want it make them very very

00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,970
nervous of picking a fight with you ever

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,130
again it's a slightly more dangerous

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,570
strategy because if you lose that fight

00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:51,520
you're sunk

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,800
and you're probably soaked for the term

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,780
of your leadership but it can be very

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,150
effective if you prepare the ground if

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,510
properly you pick your fight carefully

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:03,310
and you make damn sure you win it and

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,010
the third one is get rid of them now

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,920
that's more difficult in some

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,980
organizations and in others some cases

00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:15,280
it's not even viable but in a lot of

00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:18,100
cases it is actually the only way that's

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,320
going to work now I call these three

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:23,560
strategies schmoozing bruise them or

00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,800
lose them but the real point I want to

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,740
make is most of us will naturally have a

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,900
tendency to one end or the other some

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,700
people really don't like conflict and

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,340
they would want to show them the love

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,220
other people Rhenish the chance of a

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,800
fight and that's where they'll go first

00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:44,830
the problem there is it can take a long

00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:46,990
time to deal with this problem if you've

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:51,010
picked the wrong strategy to start with

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,930
so my advice is think these three

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,170
through

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:57,060
and consider which is actually going to

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,070
be the most effective which isn't

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:04,320
necessarily the one that you're most

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:08,760
comfortable with again I'm gonna have to

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,410
do a sneak peek right here we go next

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,810
thing I want to talk about is priorities

00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,120
how on earth do you go about deciding

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:16,830
what your priorities are often when you

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,540
take over a team from somebody else

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,070
you'll suddenly get hit with all the

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,930
things that you didn't know about you

00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,520
probably walked in knowing some of the

00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:25,170
things that needed to be solved you'll

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,670
find out the rest of them 30 minutes

00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,680
after you've taken the role on how do

00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,750
you go about sifting all this through

00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,060
well I obviously can't answer the

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,350
specifics for your team and your problem

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,730
that you're dealing with today but what

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:42,360
I can do is over the years I found that

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,820
most problems fall into one of those

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,950
bubbles and so this little diagram is

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:50,130
something that I carry around in a

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:54,480
little laminated a5 card in my bag and I

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:57,480
will regularly daily scan that diagram

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,650
and what I'm asking myself is do I know

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:03,660
what's going on in that bubble do I

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:06,240
trust the process by which that

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,460
information is coming to me because if

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,460
the answer to those two is no that is

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,280
immediately a top priority as a leader I

00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:16,560
must know what's going on in each of

00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,420
those bubbles because if I don't there

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,970
could be problems that I don't even know

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,430
about so first and foremost do I know

00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,740
what's going on do I trust the process

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:28,800
by which I find out what's going on and

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,650
it's only then can I run round there and

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,290
work out okay what are all the problems

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,020
I've got and how do I deal with them now

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:38,340
I can't put them in priority for you but

00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,900
what I can do is to give you a little

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,630
tool that I found

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:45,450
helps me and one or two others because

00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,450
I'm not the person that the first came

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:49,590
up with this um to decide how to go

00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,820
about that now one of the questions that

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:55,410
often comes up at this point is in the

00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:58,800
sorts of work that most of us in this

00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,620
room do I suspect should we carry on

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,230
coding if we are the leader of a

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,540
technical team now you'll have heard me

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,519
say previously I'm a girl

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,800
believer in if you don't practice your

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,130
skills won't improve so I'm gonna say

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,160
well yes if you want to continue to be

00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:17,870
able to code then you need to practice

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,069
it and that means you need to keep on

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,139
doing it but if you're the person in

00:11:22,069 --> 00:11:26,480
charge of a team when a problem comes

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:27,800
along from one of those bubbles who do

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,649
you think it is that's gonna have to

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,649
drop everything and deal with it well

00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:37,220
it's you so if the code that you're

00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:40,490
working on is so vital to the delivery

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,670
of your project then you're stuck when

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,339
whatever this problem is hits and so my

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:49,430
advice here is always if you have the

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:51,889
ability to do so make sure your coding

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,380
is the leader is something in the corner

00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:55,310
that can be dropped it doesn't have to

00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,740
be delivered tomorrow

00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,360
it isn't vital for the next release it

00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:05,709
can be dropped it can take a backseat

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:07,670
and you can come back to it later right

00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:09,529
trying to rattle through it because I'm

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,660
conscious we're a bit short of time and

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:13,699
I want to talk a little bit about

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:15,470
leadership styles now again this isn't

00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:18,079
my material you can look online and

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,670
you'll find lists that look very similar

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,100
to this but what they're trying to say

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:23,600
is that there are various ways in which

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,250
you can go about making decisions in

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,290
your team so at the top you've got

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,940
dictatorial that is you're the leader

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:30,740
you make the decisions and nobody else

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,709
you can get to say and as we come down

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,600
the list paternalistic is where yeah

00:12:33,709 --> 00:12:37,399
you're in charge you'll listen to what

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,360
everybody else has got to say but you're

00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:39,610
the one that's going to make the

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,529
decision in the end

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,899
consensual is where you will attempt to

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,850
seek consensus and get everybody with

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:49,670
you but it's your call and you will make

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:52,160
a call if you need to a democratic is

00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:54,680
where you have a voice and it's equal to

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,110
everybody else's is you have no more and

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,480
no less voice on the team and then

00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,269
finally hands-off is where you don't

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,889
even give yourself a vote so your team

00:13:02,269 --> 00:13:05,899
makes the decisions

00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:07,730
you just oversee the process by which

00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,199
that's done now you'll see things

00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,000
written where they suggest that you

00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:11,550
should find your leadership style and

00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,430
learned

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:17,610
work with it absolute nonsense absolute

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,800
utter nonsense in there let me try to

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,080
show you why I might think that here's

00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,180
what I think is a far more useful tool

00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,800
so we've taken those styles and put them

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,140
on the y-axis so you've got the dictator

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,329
at the top and the hands off observer

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,630
down the bottom but let's plot something

00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:36,510
else let's plot the level of expertise

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,620
now this is a relative measure this is

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,089
how experts are you as the leader

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:45,420
compared with the people that you are

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:47,790
leaving so on the left hand side we're

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,250
saying you are a complete rookie you

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,550
know virtually nothing compared to the

00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,420
experts around it and on the other side

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,670
you're the expert

00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:04,140
they know virtually nothing and you are

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:07,709
the one that holds all the knowledge on

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,920
the screen so the sweet spot of where we

00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:13,649
should be operating in As Leaders is

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,829
somewhere in that green area the more

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:19,800
you know relative to the people around

00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:22,459
you the more you should be dictating

00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,959
those decisions the less you know

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:26,430
relative to the people around you the

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,600
more you should be handing those

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:33,360
decisions off to them and so for me it

00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,149
is not your personal style that you need

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,100
to find it is what is appropriate for

00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:42,630
the team that I'm in I can't remember

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,310
which water I was gonna do this in so

00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,540
the slides might go a bit awry here

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,790
however my observation from the sorts of

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,410
technical work that we do is that even

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,350
that's not good enough it's not enough

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,199
to say what is my level of expertise

00:14:55,350 --> 00:15:00,870
versus my team because actually I found

00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,670
that this changes day by day depending

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:04,730
on the topic that's being discussed I've

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,410
even had examples where this has changed

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:10,050
during the course of a conversation with

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:14,190
one individual as we move topic our

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,410
relative expertise shifts like the wind

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,269
so you might have been able to pick a

00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,190
sweet spot in here on the sorts of

00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:22,020
projects I was doing as an electrical

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,329
engineer and you could live with that

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,800
sweet spot for the whole duration of the

00:15:24,329 --> 00:15:26,749
project

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,319
not in the kind of work that we do

00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:32,720
you're moving up and down in here daily

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:37,309
hourly even within the course of a few

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,470
minutes my piece of advice is if you

00:15:37,309 --> 00:15:41,749
find that you're doing that just be very

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:44,389
careful hopping from one extreme to the

00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:46,670
other in one hit the people around you

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:48,079
will likely find that very confusing and

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,389
they'll wonder what on earth your

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,759
behavior is and what's driving it so if

00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,540
you find you do need to shift try to do

00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:58,100
it gradually

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:59,509
one night one notch at a time um quickly

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,160
I want to look at so what does the

00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:03,799
behavior there's not in that sweet spot

00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,179
look like well if you're dictating to

00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:09,079
people who already know what they're

00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:11,239
doing I'd call you a git if we're down

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:12,949
in the other corner you're failing to

00:16:11,239 --> 00:16:15,049
provide your level of expertise and

00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:18,730
you're leaving people adrift so perhaps

00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,730
we could call that subversion

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:24,590
very very quickly I want to talk about

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,120
process I know this slide is a bit wordy

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,890
but the copyright says I have to put it

00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,360
up like this but what I actually want to

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,850
drill your attention to is the very

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,070
first thing on that list and that is the

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,660
authors of that our manifesto said that

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:38,300
they value individuals and interactions

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:41,720
over processes and tools and they chose

00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:43,640
to put that first on the list and I

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,410
think they were spot on right my

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,960
observation on process and you as the

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:51,860
leader will be in charge of process is

00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,800
that too many people think they know all

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,740
about it they think they're a

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,870
grandmaster in some agile technique or

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,590
other and projects should be run in that

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:06,020
light complete rubbish let's go back to

00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:10,089
that style and expertise diagram you're

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,760
operating here unless you know all about

00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:15,650
scrum extreme programming prince2 and

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,440
all the other ones that have existed

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:20,450
over the years and unless you've had

00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:23,480
experience of being in projects that are

00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:26,540
using it you are not an expert on

00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:28,550
process and if you're not an expert on

00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:31,070
process what are you doing trying to

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,110
dictate what everybody else does you're

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,870
firmly in that left-hand box you're

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,060
being again instead you should be

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:40,100
finding what works for you and for your

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:42,110
team by all means get yourself more

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:45,440
educated so that you can steal ideas

00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:47,270
from these various processes but I would

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,330
suggest that very few of us in this room

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,070
are really expert enough in the business

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,500
and the process of developing software

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:58,990
to be operating anywhere near the top of

00:17:54,500 --> 00:18:02,090
that y-axis so to sum up

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,310
practice makes perfect go and find

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:07,610
opportunities go and look them out to go

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:09,290
and seek them and take them on board if

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,180
you find you have to deal with a

00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,820
resentful member of your team then it

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,070
sloughs and bruising or lose them choose

00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:19,570
one carefully don't just go with the one

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:22,040
that you naturally fit with most easily

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:24,080
priorities you've got a deal with the

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,060
fact that the unexpected will come along

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,580
and you're the person that will have to

00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,410
pick it up so don't make yourself so

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,740
indispensable somewhere else that that

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,390
is

00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:37,490
self a problem style one notch at a time

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:40,309
be aware of the fact that your behavior

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:42,740
will have to change over time sometimes

00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:44,990
very rapidly try and keep the swings

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:47,360
from one extreme to another to a minimum

00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:52,910
move carefully up and down and process

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,890
don't be a git thank you very much for

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,540
coming to listen to me it's always very

00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,820
nerve-racking when you stand up and you

00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,929
had a talk submitted and accepted and

00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,550
you wonder whether anybody actually

00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,170
wants to bother listening to what you

00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,630
have to say so it's great to see you all

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:07,460
here my contact details are there and

00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,809
I'm around for the for the rest of the

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,160
conference please do come and have a

00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:15,239
chat and thank you

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,239
[Applause]

00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,470
[Applause]

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:28,509
so we have plenty of time for all the

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,509
questions okay

00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:38,600
Thanks so that was really interesting um

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,730
there's a real danger when you're

00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,119
deciding which strategy to use with

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:49,580
someone who is the potential problem as

00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:52,249
you indicated how does one judge which

00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,809
strategy to take because if you make the

00:19:52,249 --> 00:19:56,299
wrong one it's going to backfire on you

00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,789
and would leave you in a worse position

00:19:56,299 --> 00:20:00,950
than before potentially yeah and that is

00:19:58,789 --> 00:20:02,840
very definitely the case for each one of

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:04,340
those because the danger with getting

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,899
rid of someone is obviously you've just

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,059
shipped a load of skills straight out

00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:10,669
the door that possibly you didn't even

00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,139
know you were losing and as I as I said

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,059
in the talk if you pick a fight with

00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:15,919
someone and lose it you're in real

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:19,609
trouble that's very difficult to recover

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,989
and what's perhaps not so well noticed

00:20:19,609 --> 00:20:24,169
which people often think that what that

00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:25,549
means is we should always smooth them we

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,529
should always try to show them the love

00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:32,090
the danger with that one is that that

00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:33,889
can just fail to work for a long period

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:35,929
of time and that resentment just

00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:38,659
Fester's and Fester's and Fester's and

00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:40,369
in some cases some people will attempt

00:20:38,659 --> 00:20:42,649
to spread that poison they'll recruit

00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:44,450
allies and and you've got a bigger and

00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:47,649
growing problem on your hands and the

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,669
project will just fail and for me

00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:51,049
getting rid of them out of the door is

00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:53,450
often driven by whether or not the

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,700
organization will allow you to do that

00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:58,549
in a lot of organizations that is just

00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,289
so difficult to do that it's not even

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,299
worth thinking about actually in a lot

00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:04,429
of cases you may well have had to have

00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:06,169
picked a fight with them and recorded

00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,639
every last detail of it before you're

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:12,499
even allowed to do that in other

00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:14,929
organizations it's a lot simpler and so

00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:17,720
whether or not to pick the lose them

00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:20,480
strategy is organization driven for me

00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:22,879
the bruise them strategy really comes

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,850
down to whether there is a fight that

00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:28,669
you can very definitely win and be seen

00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,009
to win and if there isn't you stuck with

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,779
showing them the love hoping that it

00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:33,130
works and possibly kicking them out of

00:21:32,779 --> 00:21:34,990
the door

00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:40,570
later on when you've proven to the

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:42,280
entire world that it won't probably by

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,050
having three or four fights along the

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:48,310
way

00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:52,600
one sorry oh here wonderful talk I

00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:55,480
wanted to ask I kind of wonder whether

00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:59,290
you explained this to the team that you

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,840
are leading you know that then they then

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,090
they kind of understand for example once

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,980
you are going from get to subversion

00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,260
hopefully not but you know on this and

00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,620
this exit that you are actually flexible

00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:14,710
within your leadership style as long as

00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,470
the resentment issue has been dealt with

00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:19,510
then yes absolutely

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,090
I would tend to keep this sort of stuff

00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,070
to myself if I've got that sort of issue

00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,920
to deal with when I first take a team on

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,410
because all too often if somebody's

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:31,900
already got a problem with you they'll

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:34,180
use anything to try and attack you and

00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,340
by showing that you want to do this sort

00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,840
of stuff it's almost invariably new and

00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,640
it's different and there are certain

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,320
individuals that will just take that and

00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,940
use it as part of their ammunition and

00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:47,290
just make your life more difficult so

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:49,690
yes I would absolutely as soon as I can

00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,430
and that means the resentment any

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:54,970
resentment issues have been dealt with

00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,810
and cleared out of the way but yes

00:22:54,970 --> 00:23:00,970
absolutely

00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:03,820
i won I've only been like a either

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:05,050
temporarily in my life and I always have

00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,350
this problem actually multiple times

00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,880
that you have people who are like longer

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,650
the company or like just more

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,170
experienced and that you have rookies

00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:17,860
themselves and sometimes rookies have

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:20,200
very flexible attitudes to some rules

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,060
and so on but the general pattern firm

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,940
is not that they dislike you as a leader

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:26,950
but they dislike each other because they

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,860
have yeah different attitudes to I'll

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,860
know to code style for example this

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:35,260
actually happened to me and what do you

00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:37,600
do if they start fighting like and if

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,400
you don't step in obviously so now they

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,110
they both hate you as well because you

00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,270
don't do your job right so how do you

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,070
solve the problem of people not hating

00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,639
you but hating each other right you

00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:50,679
don't want to fire both of them

00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:53,859
yes I've unfortunately dealt with more

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:56,019
than one team where there were collapses

00:23:53,859 --> 00:23:59,859
of marriages within the team let's say

00:23:56,019 --> 00:24:02,940
for all sorts of reasons and and yet

00:23:59,859 --> 00:24:07,119
that cat you you eventually become a

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:09,700
mediator a counselor and like I can only

00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,649
suggest and it's what I've done myself

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,109
is that if that's what you find yourself

00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:16,239
doing repeatedly and and I have done it

00:24:14,109 --> 00:24:19,659
myself is you go and learn those

00:24:16,239 --> 00:24:21,639
counseling skills and you can do it and

00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:23,230
again you can volunteer to do it you can

00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:26,259
read books on the subject you can go and

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,869
practice it but they're vital and and

00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:32,590
you really are acting as a counselor and

00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:34,929
a mediator in a in a fight between two

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,460
people often nothing to do with the

00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,109
project that you're working on but

00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:39,940
actually even when it is it doesn't

00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:42,759
matter because the fight has become more

00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,009
important but those counseling and

00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:46,809
mediation and arbitration skills are

00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,489
things that you can read about you can

00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:54,999
learn and you can practice and my

00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:57,879
suggestion is to do precisely that yeah

00:24:54,999 --> 00:25:00,789
question what's your favorite strategy

00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:02,739
when the size of a team exceeds what one

00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:04,840
single person can actually handle of

00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:07,659
course you can always do the standard

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,970
way of forming a pyramid where you just

00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:12,369
have like three sub leaders and once a

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:13,960
week you call them in you smack em for

00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,179
what they've done and then you've

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,429
basically done yeah so it's basically I

00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:20,950
think it's the easy path but you lose

00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:23,320
connection to the team and if you divide

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:25,239
your team in sub departments then maybe

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,549
once a department will be good because

00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:29,859
it has a good sub head and the other

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:31,690
ones will just fail and they like

00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:34,389
sharing knowledge and so on so what's

00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:36,039
your take on their I take us back to

00:25:34,389 --> 00:25:38,919
those leadership styles it really

00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:41,379
depends on what my level of expertise is

00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:42,909
versus the people around me I've I've

00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:45,869
seen it go very very wrong

00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:48,369
when a leader is warped in and decided

00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:50,649
ourselves bang bang bang bang bang three

00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:52,600
department heads or three sub teams or

00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,960
whatever it might be without bothering

00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,399
to find out first whether the people who

00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,810
were doing the work thought that that

00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:02,840
was a good idea and guess what

00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:04,100
failed spectacularly so it really you

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,960
know but on the other hand if you've

00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,460
been with that organization for twenty

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,430
years and you're the person who really

00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,440
knows how this place works then ya put

00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,960
yourself right at the top of that axis

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,360
and you decide so it is really one of

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,970
those decisions that is well where are

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,340
you versus the people on your team how

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:25,550
much do you know about how this

00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,080
organization works versus the people

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,970
that you're leading so how long have

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,640
they been in there this organisation and

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,070
how long have you been there and I have

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,410
seen it work very very well indeed where

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:38,600
somebody says well I'm fresh into this

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:40,310
company I've never been here before all

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,590
of you have been here exactly 10 years

00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:44,780
or more you tell me how it should be

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:47,120
organized I'll hold you to it

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:49,250
you know we will decide the process and

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,160
the organization between us and I will

00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:55,310
hold you to it but you tell me how we

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:58,670
should do it and so if it really is a

00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:01,670
case of where are you on that on that

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,620
plot and the knowledge that we're

00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:05,420
talking about in this case and your

00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,920
relative expertise is the knowledge of

00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:11,810
the organization that you're working

00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:17,210
within okay so let's have one more

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:20,690
question M how so with that leadership

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:23,180
styles how do you reconcile that with

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:25,640
the need to train say if somebody who

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,890
needs to improve their skills in

00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,240
specific areas thinking in terms like if

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,890
you've been at the company say it 20

00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,530
years you don't want to be the guy

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,060
feeling or like all the because you

00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:37,460
just happen to be all the expert in

00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,700
every area so how like how do you may

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,580
push those to that decision may again

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,680
down so that other people can develop

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,510
that skill yeah excellent question

00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,940
this is a cracking example for me of

00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:53,330
we're shifting too far along that sweet

00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:56,660
spot won't work if if you've got people

00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,490
who are used to being told what to do by

00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,260
somebody who is more expert than them

00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,960
and that's the way in which they've

00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:04,850
always worked if you suddenly move to

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,820
the other end of the scale and you say

00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:10,730
right from now on I'm doing nothing it's

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:12,360
all up to you it will collapse it will

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,299
be so far from what

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,799
used to that they want very rarely are

00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:18,360
they going to be able to cope and so

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,660
this for me is an example of where you

00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,120
move down that scale one notch at a time

00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,830
so if you're starting from a point where

00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:28,440
you've got a team who is used to just

00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:31,470
being told what to do you move them to a

00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:33,299
point where you're asking them what they

00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,040
would like to do but you're still making

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,110
the call and once you've gotten

00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:39,690
comfortable with that you move to the

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,809
next one down so as long as you move

00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:45,150
gradually down that scale I've seen it

00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:47,880
work I've seen it fail spectacularly

00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:52,320
when you try and leapfrog from one end

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:57,440
to the other and two more questions I

00:28:52,320 --> 00:29:00,330
think so going back to the fights

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:05,460
amongst the teams what if it's more

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:07,950
passive so I manage the team where my

00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:11,010
developers are I myself a software

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,840
engineer but some of the engineers on my

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,210
team they have had 25 years of

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,120
experience and they're very very good

00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,429
and they get job done quickly

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,669
efficiently and some of the other team

00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:27,390
members are recent like five plus years

00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:32,580
of experience and they're very you know

00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:34,860
very like paid and they will spend time

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,799
going through like the old code and

00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,320
making sure you know have proper spacing

00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,840
or things like that how do you manage

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,059
that like how do you you don't you want

00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:48,299
to follow the standards right but not

00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:50,400
also so much that you're losing time of

00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:52,890
the court should be readable it's Python

00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,380
is mostly always readable anyway so how

00:29:52,890 --> 00:30:01,110
do you come to that medium and how do

00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:03,179
you convince your team to work in that

00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:05,549
medium I think there are two separate

00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,110
issues there there's this firstly how do

00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:08,730
you deal with the fact that you have

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,340
some people are far more experienced

00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:13,590
than others and slightly less tolerant

00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,690
of those with less experience and that's

00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:18,120
that's one problem to deal with the

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,070
second one is where that's reached a

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,370
point where they are fighting against

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,429
one

00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:27,390
and you've got to fight not yet

00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:30,210
so always best to get it sorted before

00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:31,529
we reach the fight and I often come back

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:33,870
to this diagram because one of the

00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:35,580
questions I want to sell they go round

00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:39,299
this diagram and one of the questions I

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,940
want answered is how do how well do I

00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:47,130
trust the process by which I'm getting

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:49,710
information so am I for example only

00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:52,770
hearing one side of this argument

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:55,470
because this individual takes the time

00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:58,950
to come and bother me every hour on the

00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,720
hour and I I am absolutely fully versed

00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,549
in everything that they think about

00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,159
every subject on the face of the planet

00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:06,990
but actually I don't know anything about

00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:08,880
the other side of the argument so the

00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,710
very first thing for me when I when I

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,669
hear this sort of thing going on is I

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:18,179
must be confident that I understand both

00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:21,480
sides of this argument or fight before I

00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:23,100
make a single move and then you really

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,690
into something you really into dealing

00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,409
with them in the same way as dealing

00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:30,929
with the resentment can you take some of

00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:33,179
the more experienced people and persuade

00:31:30,929 --> 00:31:37,350
them that with that hard-won experience

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:39,179
that's so well valued they would be of

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,740
even more value if they could spread

00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:42,750
that experience to their less

00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,870
experienced colleagues and if you can

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,360
find ways of rewarding them each time

00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:50,820
they do it rather than rewarding them

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,429
for the quality of their code reward

00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:55,320
them every time they manage to impart a

00:31:53,429 --> 00:31:58,440
piece of knowledge that improves the

00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:01,230
code of someone else and that can simply

00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,029
be buying calling them out on it in a

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,460
meeting I'm not talking about bonuses

00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:08,789
here it can simply be giving someone a

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:12,539
verbal pat on the head a thank you and a

00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:15,179
very simple reward but all too often we

00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:16,820
reward the wrong things and we don't

00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:19,679
reward it's like dealing with a child

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:23,360
you reward the behavior that you'd like

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:26,100
to see and you ignore the bad behavior

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,880
so a lot of questions means that you

00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,150
have to reiterate the talk in the

00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,700
application

00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:38,410
and it's still on Friday look it for

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:43,660
Friday and two o'clock I think in the

00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:45,760
same room one more question so by the

00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:47,710
way just to answer yours as well but the

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,780
PAP 8 if people are complaining about

00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:51,970
the about that sort of things in con

00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,390
reviews I used yep

00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,490
for code formatting no more the question

00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,600
for you a one to ones what's your style

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,240
do you like

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,250
what's the how's it going the status of

00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:07,480
the project do you like more personal

00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:09,280
level it depends it really depends on

00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,870
the organization that I'm in to be

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,400
perfectly honest you know because some

00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,809
organizations will insist that these

00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,340
things are done in a certain way at

00:33:13,809 --> 00:33:16,690
certain frequency and there if that's

00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,179
the case there's no point fighting it

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,580
you've just got to go with it and

00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:26,020
personally I think these things are far

00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:28,840
better done you know the slide that said

00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:30,429
we value interactions between people

00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,860
over processes well I think this is a

00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,530
cracking example if there is a process

00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:37,300
that says you will sit down at 9:30 on a

00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:38,830
Friday morning and have a discussion and

00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,559
here is the agenda that we use every

00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:42,970
week well I think there's a better way

00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,800
of doing that and a better way of doing

00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:48,090
that is to make sure that you are

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,290
speaking to your team regularly now

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:52,809
different people will have a different

00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:54,670
idea of what sufficiently regularly

00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:56,679
means to them and you can get it wrong

00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:58,990
in both directions but it's only by

00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:00,520
trying it you're very quickly realize if

00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:02,530
you're irritating someone because you're

00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:04,090
making them speak to you too often and

00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:05,920
you'll very quickly realize that you're

00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:07,720
irritating someone because they're not

00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,200
getting as much attention as this person

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,480
over here and I think for me you have to

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,639
find that level that correct level with

00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,790
each individual member of your team and

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:21,250
try to hit it and I think that works far

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:25,270
better if you're able to do that within

00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:28,600
the organization that you're in okay I

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:30,630
think it's time to thank our speaker I

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,690
think we should do it twice

00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,690
