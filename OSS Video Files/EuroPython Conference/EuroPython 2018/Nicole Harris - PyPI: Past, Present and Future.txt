The Python Package Index (PyPI) is the principal repository of software packages for the Python programming language.

In May 2018, PyPI served 12.3 billion HTTP requests, with 1.4 million people visiting pypi.org via their web browser.

The Python community depends on PyPI for the ongoing functioning of the entire Python ecosystem.

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,780
so thank you very much to the organizers

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,740
for having me and for sorting out all of

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:10,830
our technical problems so as as was just

00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:13,530
said my name is Nicole I'm a designer

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,420
and a web developer I am Australian as

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,340
mentioned but I do live here in Scotland

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,199
I live in Perth which is a beautiful

00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,289
part of the country it's about an hour

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,910
north of here as here in Edinburgh and

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:25,439
just to make things slightly more

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,220
complicated I actually work for a French

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,920
company so I lead the UX and UI team at

00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,930
people dock we're actually a sponsor of

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,390
euro Python this year and we're hiring

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,850
so if you're looking for a position come

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,129
and talk to me but that's not why I'm

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,050
here today to speak to you I'm here

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,510
instead to talk about my experience

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,640
working on warehouse which is the

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,469
project that currently powers pi PI

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,210
naught PI pi PI pi

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,539
we have to make that distinction for

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,809
obvious reasons so I've been working on

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:00,180
the user experience user interface HTML

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:03,690
and CSS code base on warehouse for about

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,909
three years now and via warehouse I am a

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,869
member of the Python packaging Authority

00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:12,299
so that's a group of developers who are

00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:14,670
generally focused on improving the state

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,729
of the Python packaging world now a fun

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,110
fact that I found out whilst researching

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,650
doing some research for this

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,810
presentation the PI PA one of the

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,509
original proposed names was the Ministry

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,460
of installation which I really love that

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,380
I'm quite disappointed they didn't

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,630
choose that in the end but it so aptly

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,640
describes really what what the PI pa-pa

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,390
is about it's about installing stuff

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,640
basically on your computer and also via

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,040
warehouse I'm a member of the Python

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,790
packaging working group so the working

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,740
group is an organization it's a sub body

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,850
of the Python Software Foundation and

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,170
our our goal is to raise money to try

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,049
and improve the state of Python

00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,259
packaging so the long term vision is to

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,659
be able to fund both PI PA projects so

00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:08,220
the official projects things like pi PI

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,080
and pip and virtual names but also to be

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,280
able to have funds that are available to

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,170
the community to be able to fund

00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,320
different projects that are emerging in

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:19,120
the packaging space so as described I'm

00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:22,530
here today to tell you a little bit

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,330
about the Python package index its story

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,480
look at its history and also ask some

00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,490
questions about where it will go in the

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,760
future

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,440
so basics first a quick introduction for

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,750
newcomers what is the Python package

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,340
index so this is my definition I didn't

00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:39,580
get it off Wikipedia or anything like

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,180
that

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:45,100
so it's the place for Python programmers

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,350
to publicly share their code so that

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,860
other people can use their code so when

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:53,410
I say I've deliberately highlight savvy

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,570
because it's the place that's supported

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,030
by the PSF and recommended by pi PA

00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:59,260
tools and publicly because there's

00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,520
obviously lots of other ways that you

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,730
can share your code but this is the

00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,860
place where the community has chosen to

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:09,070
invest so it's built for the community

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,110
by the community and you've probably

00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,790
even if you don't really know what it is

00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:16,170
you probably already use it because when

00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:18,100
you type pip install my favorite project

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,810
what's actually happening is you're

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:25,330
getting the file off of the pi pi

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:28,420
servers and it's mostly via pip that the

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:31,570
index last month served eleven point two

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,430
billion HTTP requests and if we

00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:35,970
extrapolate that out over a 12-month

00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:40,090
period it means that we're serving about

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,920
134 billion 400 million HTTP requests a

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,440
year that's probably a conservative

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,930
estimate because that's going up every

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,080
month so this is basically what we're

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,450
handling and the other side other than

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,840
obviously being able to access it by pip

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:58,930
install is we have a web interface at pi

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,510
pi/2 org and that's the place where you

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:03,070
can go and you can search for four

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,420
different packages to install and you

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,650
can find out the information about

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:11,980
packages and on pi pi org last month we

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:14,140
had 1.3 million unique visitors from 228

00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,359
different countries and if you start to

00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,730
break that down by region we can see

00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:20,919
that the largest group of users is

00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,200
actually located in Asia followed by the

00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:24,980
Americas so that

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,660
North and South America bundled together

00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:29,400
followed by Europe then Africa which has

00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,880
got a growing Python community and

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,980
Oceania if we break that down my country

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,110
you can see that the u.s. is just ahead

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,930
of China China's rapidly catching up

00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,970
with the US followed by India and then

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,980
in terms of the European community in

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,290
the top 10 we've got Germany the UK

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:49,140
Japan and Russia

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,740
sorry not Japan France and Russia I just

00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,960
relocated Japan so all of this costs a

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,650
lot of money so it costs this is a

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,500
back-of-the-envelope calculation cost

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:04,890
about 118 thousand US dollars a month to

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,140
run pi PI in terms of servers CDN

00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:09,900
monitoring paying for search that kind

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,270
of thing and all of those services are

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,730
currently donated by sponsors so again

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,670
if we extrapolate that out to over a

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:20,240
12-month period it costs about 1.4

00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:24,360
million dollars a year to run the index

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:29,040
so all of that to say that the index is

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,680
big and it's important so I joined

00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,570
Python packaging about three years ago

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,340
I'm quite quite a new face on the scene

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,890
but I found it really interesting to

00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,200
take a look into the history of PPI to

00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:43,280
see how we actually got to this kind of

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:46,290
mammoth project so this is what I found

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,390
so I want you to cast your mind back to

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,860
the early 2000s if you can I realized

00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,770
there will be some people in this room

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:56,160
who were you know very young infants at

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:58,620
the time perhaps not even born it was a

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:02,820
time of Tamagotchi I remember these at

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,520
my school amazing double denim hotmail

00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,560
was the most popular email service

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,070
because Gmail didn't actually exist at

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,350
that time Google did exist but it looked

00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:15,750
like this but you might have been using

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:18,780
Ask Jeeves anyway anyone remembers our

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:20,430
STIs and despite Python being released

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,070
for 10 years the Python Software

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:27,630
Foundation wasn't actually founded until

00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:30,450
March the 6th 2001 so at that time

00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:32,860
several developers had independently

00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:36,520
recognized the issue of distributing

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:38,080
packages and several independent indexes

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,759
had popped up this is the vaults of

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,969
Parnassus which i think is the most

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,460
amazing example of early web design and

00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:49,180
this was an absolutely it was probably

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:53,710
the most popular independent index at

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:57,669
the time in 2002 our so about a year

00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:00,460
after the establishment of the PSF

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:02,020
richard jones our proposed pet Python

00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,229
enhancement proposal for those of you

00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,110
that don't know pepp 301 which basically

00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:09,699
proposed a central index server so

00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:12,639
something that was going to be hosted on

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,860
the Python 2 org domain the PSF official

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,930
property that had an air of legitimacy

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,180
so the idea to be able to combine all of

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,509
those previously sort of scattered

00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,259
approaches to to establishing an index

00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:29,289
and that's basically what happened so in

00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:32,229
we know that pi PI was launched in very

00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:34,479
late 2002 because we have record of four

00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,789
projects registered so my bet is like

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,520
late December someone hacking after a

00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:42,099
Christmas or something but in 2003

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,210
that's where when the project really

00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:50,259
took off so we had 273 projects uploaded

00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:52,930
in 2003 at this stage there was no data

00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:55,839
actually hosted on the index so

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,430
basically it was just a list of projects

00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,740
you couldn't really even search it you

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,979
could find things by Traverse a fire so

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,279
kind of like tags and the workflow for

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,750
people was to go to the index find

00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:10,210
project that they're looking for click

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,819
through to the readme and be able to

00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:15,279
download files directly off the repeat

00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,860
which were hosted on somebody's server

00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:19,330
somewhere on the internet or you could

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,069
also go to the home page of the project

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,339
and then find the files that way so a

00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:26,199
very manual process to give you some

00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:29,680
context around what was happening in the

00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:32,409
Python community at that time so in 2002

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,800
there was the first Europe - with 240

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:38,019
attendees and in 2003 the first Python

00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,269
in the US was hosted with 200 attendees

00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,760
so really the Python community in its

00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:45,240
infancy in starting to grow and starting

00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,399
to contribute to the index

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,499
so 2004 comes along and we have easy

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,490
install so that project was kicked off

00:08:50,499 --> 00:08:56,529
in March 2004 and basically it tried to

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,569
automate the process that people were

00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,759
doing manually so it would go to PI P I

00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:02,829
basically crawl around and try and find

00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:05,559
links of things to download onto your

00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:06,939
computer or it would follow links to try

00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,589
and find things to download on

00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:09,809
somebody's website somewhere on the

00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:14,470
Internet

00:09:09,809 --> 00:09:16,569
in 2005 file link file uploads were

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:19,059
added to pi PI so people didn't need to

00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:23,290
host their own files it could actually

00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:27,670
be hosted on the index so this is what

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:29,290
the index was by 2007 in 2007 we had one

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,350
thousand two hundred and forty nine

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,899
packages uploaded so quite a substantial

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,879
growth compared to that a few years

00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:39,490
before and more and more of those

00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,199
projects were actually hosted on the

00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:44,639
servers rather than being hosted in

00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:48,610
somebody's server in their cupboard and

00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,110
this is what the the the index looked

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:52,329
like and I think many of you will

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:55,569
recognize this because from a web UI

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:57,610
perspective nothing really changed very

00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:59,110
significantly in the in the next 10

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:03,579
years it still looked pretty much like

00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:05,379
this by to 2017 but meanwhile in the

00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:08,829
background whilst nothing was happening

00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:11,350
at the front the popularity of Python as

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:15,220
a language really skyrocketed and as a

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:19,089
result the popularity of pi pi also also

00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:21,189
grew so this graph that graph shows as a

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,160
growth in the number of packages added

00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:26,740
to the index year-on-year so that's not

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,269
the cumulative number of packages on the

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,519
index simply showing the growth

00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:33,759
obviously cumulative would be a much

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,220
steeper curve and this obviously put a

00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,529
lot of pressure on the index in terms of

00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:41,319
its infrastructure so behind the scenes

00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:45,910
developers were working really hard to

00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:48,999
put out fires and scale the system for

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,429
the legitimate use of the the index from

00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:53,439
the community but also as the index

00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:55,870
became more popular there was obviously

00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:57,459
there was more malicious attacks

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,290
malicious packages and

00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:03,429
BAM that needed to be dealt with as well

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:05,829
so I have an aperture or rare footage of

00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:09,970
core dev at that time trying to work on

00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:11,769
the codebase basically there was a lot

00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,420
of firefighting because by this stage

00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:17,499
you know they're working on a code base

00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:20,379
that was you know if you look at 20 well

00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:23,290
10 growing in age let's say it's growing

00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,769
in age and and sort of not designed for

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,360
the kind of scale that it was handling

00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:32,649
so in terms of scaling this is a very

00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:36,279
brief overview of what happened so the

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:39,490
original code base assumed that pipe I

00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:41,319
was hosted on a single server and that's

00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,869
exactly what happened so it was hosted

00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:46,629
on a server called Dinsdale which was

00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:49,660
located in the netherlands with a

00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:52,679
company called excess for all so just

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,779
just sort of standard hosting in early

00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:58,059
20s or late 2012 or 2013 I couldn't

00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:59,740
quite get the dates for this the

00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:02,920
infrastructure was moved to the Oregon

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,290
State University open source lab and dr

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,329
DB was put in place so that basically

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:12,670
created mirrors for disaster recovery in

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:15,100
2013 fastly which is a CDN was added

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,230
which is basically caching on steroids

00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:21,790
they can contact me for that catchphrase

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:23,649
later and in January 2014 probably the

00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:26,920
most significant change in terms of the

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:29,410
architecture was that the code base was

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,869
moved across to Rackspace using lustre

00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,579
FS so if you are like me and you're not

00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:35,889
on infrastructure person and you don't

00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:38,769
know what gloss RFS is basically the

00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:40,990
very very high-level summary is that

00:12:38,769 --> 00:12:42,999
it's a clustered file system and it

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,429
means that pipe I was running on many

00:12:42,999 --> 00:12:48,069
servers that our team could access as

00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:51,100
though it was a single you know so it

00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:55,269
gave the team the opportunity to be able

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,029
to spin up and and retire shut down more

00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:02,889
resources as and when the project needed

00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:05,860
it at the same time I should say there

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:08,480
were several peps also proposed to help

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,230
try and improve the consistency of

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,910
the Python package index so even though

00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,640
we'd sort of scaled the index there were

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,160
still problems that remained first of

00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,160
all PI VI predates almost everything on

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,280
pi PI so I think I said 243 packages in

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,040
the first year it was built really

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:30,590
before we knew how to build great web

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,990
applications with Python so we didn't

00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,720
have any modern web frameworks to work

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:38,180
off so the the code base is using custom

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,440
custom code which means that it's really

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,450
difficult to maintain and and I think I

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,650
never personally maintained it but the

00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,740
sort of horror stories that I've heard

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:51,920
certainly certainly indicate this and

00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:54,620
because it's built in it was built in a

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,630
technology that's not that well known or

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,950
not a popular sort of web prank

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,310
framework it was really difficult to

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,480
attract new contributors to the project

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,540
also it was really difficult to set up

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,960
so Donald who I work with on poppy I

00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,610
told me that he has to comment he used

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,990
to have to comment out certain parts of

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,570
the code base just to get it to run

00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,760
locally on his computer so kind of a

00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:20,060
real nightmare for for attracting new

00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,730
contributors and because of that it was

00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,070
really no I think no is a bit harsh

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,620
so no significant new feature

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:30,490
development which means that in terms of

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,200
features a kind of segment stagnated

00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:34,880
also because it was difficult to attract

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,010
new contributors we had poor bus factor

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,500
which is a rather brutal term for saying

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,780
what would happen to your project if one

00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,580
of your core core team members were to

00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,620
be hit by a bus

00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,570
my preferred version is that is that

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,600
they leave one of us but anyway we're

00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,910
very poor by a bus factor so you had

00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,470
really a handful of people who knew how

00:14:52,910 --> 00:15:01,670
to fix problems on pi pi when problems

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:04,130
inevitably occurred so here enters our

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:06,170
hero at least one of our heroes in the

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,690
story of by PI and that's done on staff

00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,840
- I have great deal of respect for so

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,990
Donald saw pi PI and saw the problems

00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,620
with pi PI and decided to have a go at

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:21,020
doing something different so in 2011 he

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,090
created crate which was a

00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,240
alternative service to pipe I that was

00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:28,400
using the data on the pipe I service and

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,530
I'm actually gonna directly quote him

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:34,250
here he said it was a bit hacky but it

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:37,280
was popular shortly after he started

00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:41,690
making commits directly to the real pipe

00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,190
er code base and in 2014 he decided to

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,920
shut down Cray because he was sort of

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:47,990
duplicating his effort across across two

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,330
projects at the same time he was

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,210
constantly thinking about how could he

00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:55,490
rewrite the pi PI codebase to make it

00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:57,050
easier to maintain and to contribute to

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,920
so he did a number of peripheral

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,430
concepts during this this time and in

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,070
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,960
something stuck so the version of

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,470
warehouse which is the project that I

00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:12,730
work on was established in early 2015

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:14,540
using the pyramid web framework and

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,560
that's where I come in

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,060
so in June 2015 Donald posts an issue

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,650
basically saying I'm really bad at

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,140
design I need some help with this and

00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:26,060
through a good friend of mine I find out

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:28,570
about this and that's when I start to

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:34,430
become involved in in Python packaging

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:36,080
so warehouse what is it so as I said

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:38,360
it's it's using pyramids so it's using

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,220
modern text stack so we're using pyramid

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,800
we've got elastic for search and a

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,600
sequel alchemy as our ORM

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,150
we've got really modern tooling as well

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,700
so it runs on docker it's really easy to

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:51,560
set up with docket docker compose we've

00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,960
also got continuous deployment which is

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,150
really fun now that it's being launched

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,160
because if you make a change on the code

00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:01,190
base you can see it live on this massive

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,339
website within about 15 minutes it's

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,270
more stable and more secure I hope it's

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:06,680
got an improved user experience

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,680
otherwise I haven't done my job very

00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:12,080
well and it's easier to contribute to

00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,680
you so as a project we work really hard

00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,550
to support new contributors to warehouse

00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,850
we've done a lot of work on our

00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:22,520
documentation we try to support people

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,690
through the pull request process and one

00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,990
of the things that I'm really proud

00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:28,850
about on on the index is that we've had

00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,760
a number of people who've made their

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,710
first open-source pull request on the

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,550
warehouse project so many people might

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,200
think

00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:38,120
big project I couldn't possibly

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,920
contribute to something like that but

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,650
actually you can and we really want you

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,809
to so throughout the development of

00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:46,850
warehouse I've always been I think

00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,820
everyone's always been really optimistic

00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,770
about when it would go live this is a

00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:54,890
story rather crushed because of the

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:57,230
video for story this is a picture of me

00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,540
presenting at PyCon France in October

00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:01,520
2016 and you can see in the corner there

00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:04,580
it says what it actually says is good

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,580
news we're almost ready to release so

00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:09,080
that was optimistic and I think that

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,960
kind of optimism went through the

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,120
project for a long time but in reality

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,790
we had some problems with trying to get

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:18,790
the warehouse code-based live so first

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:21,380
of all the speed of development was slow

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:23,450
because we were relying on community

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:26,030
contributions and everyone was kind of

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:28,550
stretched working on other things

00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,550
there are many major features that had

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,530
not yet been started so for example the

00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:36,020
area you log into to administrate a

00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:37,820
package hadn't hadn't even begun and I

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,950
think I completely underestimated how

00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,600
much work that was going to be we didn't

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,160
have a release date inside we had no

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,670
real project management around the

00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:49,190
project and to top it all off the old

00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:50,960
code base people were still firefighting

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:55,250
on that which was taking away resources

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,340
from being able to get warehouse live so

00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:01,010
in 2017 the Python packaging working

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,679
group another hero of our story applies

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,410
for and receives a hundred and seventy

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,110
thousand US dollar grant from Mozilla so

00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:11,000
that's the Mozilla open-source support

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,100
award and that was awarded under the

00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,690
foundational technology track so

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,190
actually I'd like to give Mozilla a

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,190
round of applause for that if we can

00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:26,900
[Music]

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:29,690
I really I think the whole team really

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,100
appreciates the the the support that

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,770
we've got from Mozilla to be able to

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,120
work on on the project so this award was

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,400
specifically to fund the development

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,610
team to bring warehouse up to feature

00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,350
parity with the old codebase and to

00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:45,350
release warehouse and to shut down

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:48,530
legacy pipe I through the grant we

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,990
funded myself to developers project

00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:53,630
manager and her assistant as well as our

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,720
PSF liaison so we had basically a team

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:59,630
of what's have six six and a half people

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,940
working on the project and we achieved a

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,850
lot with that money and within the five

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,490
months that we spent that money so we

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,320
worked on authentication workflows

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:11,600
account administration you know you can

00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,179
you can reset your password which is a

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,900
good thing the management of projects

00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:21,110
releases and files we've solved a lot of

00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:23,690
UI problems lots of bug fixes we added a

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,820
lot to the documentation so one of the

00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,040
things I'm really really proud of on the

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,410
new warehouse is that we have a great

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,120
help section we linked through to the

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:33,950
help section we linked through to a lot

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,980
of documentation we found that really

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,720
important because we want people who are

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,210
new to the Python community we know

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,920
pythons being used in teaching a lot to

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:44,630
be able to understand what the Python

00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,090
package index is because it might be the

00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,640
first time they've actually used any

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:51,590
kind of index and we did an

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,260
infrastructure overhaul so that was to

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:56,510
support kuben 8 kubernetes continue

00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,170
continue assignment end-to-end

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,490
encryption and secrets management and

00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,360
during this time we we worked really

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:08,590
hard to build the community so we merged

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:11,870
425 pull requests we closed 302 issues

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,950
we supported 26 new contributors within

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:18,740
that five month period and of the 425

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,340
for requests 149 came from the community

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:24,910
which is about 35 percent obviously

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,320
excluding BOTS

00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:29,510
unusually for a software project we came

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,650
in both on time and within budget which

00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:40,400
i think is really a credit thank you

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:42,290
I really have to credit seminar from

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,660
changeset consulting who was our project

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,550
manager who did an amazing job of

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:50,990
hurting hurting everyone towards their

00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:53,240
outcome so in March 26 we released our

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,670
beta we didn't have too many problems so

00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,190
by April 16th we went live with the new

00:21:55,670 --> 00:22:00,020
codebase and by April 30th we turned off

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,720
the old codebase and there was much

00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,910
celebration Donald had actually

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:08,150
stockpile the whole number of animating

00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,490
gifts to post on slack for the very

00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:14,150
occasion so it's just celebration

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:17,300
everywhere and I think the new codebase

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:20,330
and the new website is awesome that's my

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,700
humble opinion I might be biased so this

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:24,890
is what it looks like so that's my work

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,110
and for our users it's got a lot of

00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:29,630
really great new features so we've got

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,460
markdown support so what you can do is

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:33,800
if you're wanting to enable markdown

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:38,090
support on your project readme you can

00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,380
search markdown description on pi pi and

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,840
it will come up with an example project

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,940
and that has all of the instructions on

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,580
how you can get markdown support which

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,410
has been a very heavily requested

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,170
feature for a long time you can get that

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:55,040
now on your read means it's got vastly

00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:57,050
improved a search with from elastic at

00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:59,150
the moment we're not doing anything too

00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:00,470
fancy but because we're using elastic

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,330
search it means that we can really

00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:04,610
extend the search capabilities of the

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:06,890
index which is really important it's

00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,750
fully responsive so if you want to check

00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,450
out packages whilst you're using your

00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:13,100
mobile phone you can and you can also do

00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:15,800
all the administration tasks on your

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,440
mobile as well lots of help resources as

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,840
I said it was a really important part of

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,730
the design for us and we've also got a

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,000
chronological release history really

00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:29,510
easy to see in terms of your the history

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,490
of an individual package so that's what

00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:33,050
we've got for you but for us we've got

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:35,600
some pretty important things too for our

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,610
own sanity moving for it is scalable it

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,350
is extendable learn of all and

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,960
maintainable so it's got those four

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,270
things that are really really essential

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,970
towards the health of the of the project

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,539
ongoing and we've got great ideas about

00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:51,320
how we can

00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:53,179
extends the index so one thing that I

00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,070
would really like to do is to make the

00:23:53,179 --> 00:23:57,049
user interface more accessible the

00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:59,979
Python community as we all know is

00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:03,109
really welcoming to different people and

00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:05,090
my opinion is that we should not

00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,399
restrict people who have disabilities

00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,139
from being able to fully experience the

00:24:07,399 --> 00:24:10,759
Python package index so we really want

00:24:09,139 --> 00:24:14,059
to make some accessibility improvements

00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:16,009
on the front end code we've had an audit

00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:17,739
on that and there's a few points in fact

00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:21,769
we can talk about those at the sprints

00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:23,450
as you saw earlier most well the largest

00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:25,549
group of our users are actually based in

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:27,590
Asia so it would kind of make sense to

00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:31,669
be able to localize and internationalize

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:33,440
the index I personally would like to do

00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:35,779
a lot more design research and UX

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,549
improvements on the index so right now

00:24:35,779 --> 00:24:39,349
we know it's not perfect but it's hard

00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:41,029
to make decisions on how to improve it

00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:43,789
because it's difficult to know what

00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:45,739
people want so recently I did some

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:48,349
design research where I asked people to

00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:50,479
rate what's most important to them on

00:24:48,349 --> 00:24:51,799
the project detail page that data was

00:24:50,479 --> 00:24:55,729
really really interesting and it's

00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:57,200
linked to in my slides and I'd like to

00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:58,940
continue to do that kind of work to

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,379
really understand what people wants and

00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,629
people what people need from the index

00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:06,109
so that we can improve the design in

00:25:02,629 --> 00:25:07,429
line with with those needs we'd like to

00:25:06,109 --> 00:25:09,080
add two-factor authentication

00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:12,080
there's currently a specification in

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:14,090
project in progress for this and we'd

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,359
also like to improve our audit trails so

00:25:14,090 --> 00:25:19,759
right now we know about so we have a

00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,619
project Journal basically so we can say

00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,529
what happened on an individual project

00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:29,330
so someone was added as a collaborator

00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:31,249
or there was a new release made or you

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,799
know a release was deleted for example

00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:36,169
and we we're collecting things like IP

00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,239
address and date and that's about it and

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:40,869
what we'd really like to do is to

00:25:38,239 --> 00:25:42,950
collect more information on sessions etc

00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:45,519
third parties that maybe you're

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:48,559
interacting on pi PI and to be able to

00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,389
if something goes wrong on the index for

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,460
our up for our unsafe to be able to see

00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:54,320
what happened but also to expose that

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:55,990
information to the users so you can keep

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,770
an eye on your pi PI account to see

00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:02,110
for anything fishy is going on but my

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,990
question is how we're going to get there

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:09,400
and I've got a few questions to propose

00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:12,220
to the community about that so the first

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,830
is do we as a community value the

00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:18,010
service provided by pi PI and how much

00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:20,350
so would we be able to fill the 1.2

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,660
million dollar gap if our sponsors were

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:26,380
no longer able to provide infrastructure

00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,059
donations do we care enough about the

00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:32,170
project to actually pay people to

00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:35,230
contribute to it as Python continues to

00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:37,030
grow is it stay sustainable to rely on a

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,679
handful of people to maintain and

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,200
improve pi pi now i'm not under

00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,700
estimating the number of people who who

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,190
contribute to the project but at its

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,940
core there's a handful of people who are

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,940
steering PI pi in this future direction

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:53,890
now that the Mozilla open source support

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:55,500
grant is over we sorely missed the time

00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:57,910
allocated to project management

00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:01,630
community engagement and feature

00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:04,179
development and we heard we have had

00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:05,890
actually on the project 123 amazing

00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,370
contributors but it takes work to

00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,870
support all of those people

00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:13,320
how should pi PI evolve to meet the

00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:15,610
changing needs of our community so

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,190
obviously the Python community is

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:19,600
growing growing in its size and its

00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:22,360
complexity the different ways that

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,860
people are using Python also computer

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,600
science is evolving as is web

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:28,360
development people expect different

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,830
things from their services so no doubt

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:31,360
people are going to start to expect

00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:34,360
different things from the Python package

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,540
index are we actually equipped to deal

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,520
with this and if not are we prepared to

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:44,650
allow commercial interests to fill that

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:47,530
gap so how can you help this is my call

00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:49,530
to action first off can you please

00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:52,920
verify your email address

00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:55,380
no if you know about this but basically

00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,690
at the moment we're sending to a lot of

00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,580
email to unverified email addresses

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:01,470
which means that our email address can

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,640
be classified as spam so that's not a

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,320
great situation to be in

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,910
so if you've got an account on puffy eye

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,600
please go and verify it takes two

00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:11,820
minutes you can engage with us so dis

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,850
details you'll cig if that's the mailing

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:17,490
list we've got an IRC channel PI PA

00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:19,560
that's on freenode and you can engage

00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,970
with us on our HD trackers so it's not a

00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,530
really scary world we really want to

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,290
hear from you we really want you to

00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:28,380
engage with what we're doing you can

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:31,080
contribute to warehouse on github that's

00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,300
that's the address there and you can

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,570
sprint this weekend I'm running a pi PI

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:38,370
sprint at your apartment Sprint's so I'd

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:39,960
really really love you to join me there

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,720
we've got a whole number of issues that

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,790
have been specifically tagged with ready

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,460
for the for the for the sprint so I'd

00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:49,650
love to have your contribution you can

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:51,420
donate or you can ask your company to

00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:54,720
donate donate by Peyser

00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:57,300
org so we've recently added support for

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,190
recurring donations and any recurring

00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,540
donation would be most welcome because

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,970
that would allow us to actually make

00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,790
plans in the long term about how we can

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:09,060
allocate resources to do not only pi pi

00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:10,710
but other packaging projects and you can

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,440
thank our sponsors so obviously we

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:15,120
mentioned Mozilla earlier this paid us a

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,130
hundred and seventy thousand US dollars

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,340
which is great we've also got all these

00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:23,040
infrastructure sponsors so maybe if

00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,870
you're in charge of choosing who you're

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:26,790
going to use in your organization have a

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,890
look on our sponsors page it's linked to

00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:32,090
in the footer and and see who is

00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:35,870
actually supporting the Python community

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,870
so that's it for me thank you

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:41,500
