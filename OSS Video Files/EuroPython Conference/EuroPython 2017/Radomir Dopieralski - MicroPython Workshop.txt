Title: Radomir Dopieralski - MicroPython Workshop
Publication date: 2017-09-17
Playlist: EuroPython 2017
Description: 
	"MicroPython Workshop
[EuroPython 2017 - Interactive session - 2017-07-10 - Anfiteatro 2]
[Rimini, Italy]

We will program some ESP8266-based development boards, make them blink LEDs, move servos, display pictures, read sensors, react to buttons, and, more importantly, talk over HTTP and MQTT with servers. This is an excellent occasion to try your skills in building and programming small electronic devices. No experience with electronics is required, everything you need to know will be covered during the workshop.
You will need to bring a laptop with a USB port. If it runs Windows, make sure to have some terminal emulator installed, such as PuTTy, CoolTerm or  even HyperTerm. On Linux and OSX we will use Screen, so you don't need anything special.
I only have about 20 kits for this, so the number of people that can take part is limited.

welcome everybody sorry I welcome

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:15,230
everybody we are going to have some fun

00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:19,910
with micro Python here there this is a

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:22,849
little bit an typical talk because I

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,930
don't really have a PowerPoint here or

00:00:22,849 --> 00:00:29,689
on the other slide instead I have to

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:32,390
this hardware here that you are going to

00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:36,560
take in your hands and actually do

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,170
something fun with it and I have some

00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,110
materials prepared for in with

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:47,480
instructions on what you can do with

00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:50,450
that of course but if you want to try if

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,410
you are more adventurous and already did

00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:57,079
something with this stuff before so you

00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,720
can also do your own things like have

00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,690
your own ideas about what to do and

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,979
there is also some extra stuff there

00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:11,060
that you can play with them so we have

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:14,840
about 25 people here I only have about

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:20,810
20 kids so some of you will need to work

00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:27,499
in pairs so can can can you stitch so

00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:31,729
that you know okay let's let's do it

00:01:27,499 --> 00:01:34,639
like this take the kids that are here so

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:41,270
you need the plastic bag and and the

00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:44,420
bread board with the esp8266 and the

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:48,280
people who who didn't get their will

00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,280
will sit together with someone else

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,160
yes

00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:15,620
okay so there should be a microUSB cable

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:18,140
in the endoplasmic back and you will

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,400
alternate obviously a laptop with a USB

00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:26,830
port and if you have Windows or Mac you

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,830
will need to install the drivers

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,290
if you have Linux no drivers are

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,290
necessary

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:59,090
okay so the address for the for the

00:03:55,460 --> 00:04:02,020
workshop instructions is here I don't

00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:05,180
know if you can read that easily

00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:09,460
if not then reach out I will try

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,460
something better

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:30,370
okay and I will be preparing my own

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,370
fashion here

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:51,220
oh so all right when I switch you don't

00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,220
see

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,889
again can you repeat

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:27,520
let's let me fix that for the driver

00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,190
okay so let me

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,420
okay so the proper URL for to the left

00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm sorry for the inconvenience but they

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:28,750
moved the URL when I was not looking you

00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:34,810
don't need a driver for Linux has

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:38,050
everything built-in in the kernel no no

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,180
we will only be using a sterile console

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,940
to communicate with the board and all

00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:49,570
the code that we will use will run on

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:51,250
those boards okay I'm going to while you

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,980
download and install everything I'm

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:58,300
going to give you a short introduction

00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:02,700
about what microfiber nation what how it

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:11,020
was made and what is good about good for

00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:15,250
so about seven years ago one of the they

00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:19,440
came this guy Diamond George who decided

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:25,500
ok what is we could use Python on

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:31,480
microcontroller Arduino or or you know

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:33,810
all this stuff and he started to look

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,540
around and found some old projects that

00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:41,590
attempted this but fails because Arduino

00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:45,870
really has a very small amount of memory

00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:50,980
about two kilobytes and a very slow

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:54,120
processor it's 16 megahertz and 8-bit

00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:57,640
processor so very very slow

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,860
however turns out that you know what is

00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,660
not standing still and new

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,350
microcontrollers come out all the time

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:08,200
and diamond decided to build his own

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:14,020
microcontroller board that is similar to

00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:19,560
Arduino but that is a bit more advanced

00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:22,390
and can run his own version of Python so

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,180
he started experimenting with that and

00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:26,919
he started to write his own version of

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:30,819
Python from scratch

00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:34,180
in C and the at some point he decided

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:36,820
okay I can make it work let's make a

00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,250
Kickstarter out of it and he put it on

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,659
Kickstarter and it was a great success

00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:46,600
of course and he made this piebald

00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:51,490
thing that you can still buy from

00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:55,290
microfiber bulk product which which has

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:57,910
a quite powerful at the entity to

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:02,170
microcontroller on it and Rance Python

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:06,010
natively it has an accelerometer and SD

00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:10,420
card slot a bunch of buttons you can use

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:16,800
and a lot of pins you can connect stuff

00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:19,779
to and quite powerful platform and

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,740
everything was fine people started using

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:28,199
it the community started to grow and

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:33,600
some time later there came this esp8266

00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:37,839
board that was initially invented as a

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,660
Wi-Fi bridge for Arduino however people

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,420
figured out that the CPU on this is

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:46,660
actually 10 times better than an Arduino

00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:51,850
and people have figured out how to

00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:57,820
program them instead of Arduino and at

00:09:51,850 --> 00:10:00,399
some point Danny and George and Paul two

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:04,050
people decided to try and implement the

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,760
micro Python for this board there was a

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:10,720
quick proof of concept implementation

00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:14,709
that they did which worked to pressingly

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:17,320
well and they started a second

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:20,649
Kickstarter to finish that and polish

00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,600
that and now we have a proper

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:25,029
implementation of micro Python for those

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:29,720
boards why we are using those boards and

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:33,430
not the type of one so the thing is

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,290
the pie board it's a very good

00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,740
development board however it's quite

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:43,310
expensive because it's so powerful and

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:46,210
on the other hand the ASB eight to six

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:50,300
six board is extremely cheap it's

00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:53,540
produced in bulk in China by a Chinese

00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:56,080
company called expressive and you can

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,920
get a development board like this one

00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:02,720
for about three or four dollars so

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:07,040
that's why I was able to make all those

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,930
kids for you to play with today so we

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,630
are going to use that however there are

00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:13,280
also other you have to remember that

00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,740
there are also other ports that you can

00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,190
use when when you outgrow the esp8266

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:22,130
and when you need something more like

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:24,770
there is this open MV board for instance

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:29,660
that has a camera on it and you can

00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:33,520
actually detect faces or you know do all

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:37,280
sorts stuff of computer vision with it

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:42,280
anyway so who hasn't installed the

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,280
drivers yet hands up

00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:51,910
okay I will come to you actually it will

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:55,570
be easier if I just come to you and help

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:57,700
all of you and not stand here so I told

00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,980
the camera lady and I'm very sorry I'm

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,350
going to be walking around so this video

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:08,520
is probably not going to be a very good

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,520
recording of this talk and so

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,820
you

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,610
you

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,839
you

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,000
you

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,250
use this one

00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,170
[Applause]

00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:20,099
here just put it on the on the stage I

00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:21,779
will clean that up and we can look if

00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,389
you didn't finish everything that you

00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:27,149
wanted to do or you want to do some more

00:18:24,389 --> 00:18:29,309
stuff then find me to ring the strings

00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:32,029
and we can continue playing with this

00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:35,449
and maybe do some more advanced things

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,449
thank you very much

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:39,400
