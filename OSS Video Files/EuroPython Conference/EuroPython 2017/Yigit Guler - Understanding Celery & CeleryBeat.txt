	"Understanding Celery & CeleryBeat
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Celery is a distributed task queue for Python. Although it is most popular in the web development ecosystem, it has a wide area of usage from system management to IoT devices. With Celery, transforming a function into a task is quite easy and can add great performance &amp; usability to the applications that we build.

This talk aims to give attendants a general overview on Celery and its uses. We will walk through the core Celery architecture by introducing key components with the help of various real-world examples. This will also lead to an understanding of the task queue systems in general. Attendants will also gain knowledge about Celerybeat; a tool that focuses on scheduling tasks.

We will be looking for the answers to the following questions:

What is a distributed task queue?
What are the main elements of Celery?
When should we use Celery tasks?
How do we use Celery Beat?

Attendants should have a basic knowledge of Python, and a minor development experience.
