Description: 
	"Django: From a nightmare to a dream with Best Practices.
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 1]
[Rimini, Italy]

With the adventure in the source code of the site of EuroPython, we have detected that the code was difficult to maintain. With the members of the Web team, we have started to refactor the code with the best practices and good concept. Also, we will see some awesome libraries for the Django project.

In brief, you have a legacy code and you want to improve it with best practices, then this talk is for you. 

You don't want to break it but you don't want to change it because you can break it at all times, we will show you how to improve an existing code with some tools and best practices, and your code can be deploy on Friday evening with no risk.

From a nightmare to a dream.

Keywords, TDD, Refactoring, Tests, BDD, Selenium, CI, and many more...

fan of jungle

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,309
I prefer flasks bad because I sign a

00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:40,410
contract with jungle for jungle Bala

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:43,929

yes only develop some backends web

00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,989
services with Python of course I think I

00:00:58,809 --> 00:01:03,059
Oh

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:06,940

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,130
geography on the left is just a draw of

00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,060
my daughter you can see there is a big

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:16,720
snake on the center it's me I am a

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,970
Python lover of course I use uh pursues

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,480
a developer pursues an open source is

00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,730
just my life since twenty years and I

00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:28,360
just create the Python for them you can

00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:31,680
come for next year and what else yeah I

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:34,960
am member of the PSF of EPs and received

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:40,180
CSI from the PSF because I just create

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:43,510
the pythons of them just that so for

00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:46,330
presentation I need a use case and in

00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:50,700
this case in the story sorry I'm going

00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:54,070
to use the Euro Python website okay I

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,220
appreciate the work with which has be

00:01:54,070 --> 00:02:00,280
done by the current developer of

00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:03,010
European website we know Yura Python is

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,080
just an awesome project we are there

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,129
that really that's really awesome

00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,310
because without your python or python

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:14,620
python is not

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:18,410
fabulous project thank you

00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:21,200
so this even has been organized by some

00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,660
people and yes people the organizer are

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:27,620
the main developers of Python of your

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,720
Python sorry and we have some work

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,840
groups in Europe item we have the

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,060
Financial Group the support group and of

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,940
course a marketing group and there is

00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:40,550
the web team group I am in this work

00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:45,170
group my first contribution to the

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:47,810
website was in 2007 2015 3 I'm not

00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,930
French I'm not English and when I have

00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,630
time contribute to the project but when

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,500
I have time and maybe that's the main

00:02:53,630 --> 00:03:00,980
reason why I not a big contributor but

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:03,739
is this year just explain that I sign a

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,400
contract to a developer to be a jungle

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:11,690
developer ok I'm a normally I'm I am a

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:16,519
Python expert and I know flask may be

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:18,019
jungle is not ready secured ok so if you

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,540
want to read the source code of your

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:26,720
Python the website you can go on this

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:29,480
address ok first you can contribute so

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,330
Europe I to the website of Europe icon

00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:35,390
is not just a facade it's not just a

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:38,840
small site where you can see the speaker

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:41,360
or just the attendees and the rest with

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,840
your Python we can do the conference

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,120
management we can manage the ticket for

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,040
the assign and a sign or just a fan

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,100
tickets you can come we can do some

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,880
statistics about the attendees speakers

00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:02,060
and the rest we can also make the

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:06,860
invoices or just a refund I cannot come

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:09,860
can you can you resend me ok maybe when

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,750
you send an email to the support because

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,790
you have an issue with one person or

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,150
because you have another program

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:20,030
whatever there is the head desk and this

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,669
a desk will use your Python the European

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,800
site

00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:27,099
sometimes we receive some notification

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,889
by email we'd only use any other system

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:34,810
any external system don't we don't use a

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:37,120
DBS or just machine but sometimes and

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:41,110
you don't know that that with the last

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,330
version of Europe I turn we can do the

00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,240
booking for the rooms for the hotel and

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,999
of course for the SIM cards but we try

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:54,849
to remove this card because it does not

00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:58,360
work but yes we can do that so the

00:04:54,849 --> 00:05:01,479
website if you can is a real good tool

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,939
because it's not just our simple website

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:08,680
even though the the invoice is the

00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:11,789
refunding and the rest but sometimes we

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:18,099
need to do the State of the Union

00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:23,289
firstly we use Python 2.7 support with

00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:31,960
that we stopped in 2000 2020 and we use

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:35,770
jungle 1.8 know the the last migration

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:41,050
to the jungle 1.8 is be done in the last

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:44,080
year - during the last Eurofighter we

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,779
use some differences but the appearances

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:51,490
are just broken with the new version of

00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:58,409
jungle or there's no manor as very

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:58,409
boring of course we use a skylight sorry

00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,840
the best is just after we have no theft

00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:17,950
can you stop it come back we have 100 or

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:25,320
200 five and twenty seven thousand lines

00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:25,320
of code and noticed and no documentation

00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,320
sometimes we can read and you can check

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:36,340
in the South code the canons are just in

00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:39,990
Italian I do sopa sopa de italiano see

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:41,500
man we are just some English speaker

00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,680
that's right

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:50,440
and we understand English or French or

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:53,650
Italian flow okay sometimes we can see

00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,390
in the source code of your Python some

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:59,170
Paris of the curl the code is just

00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:04,840
duplicated or we can see some dead girl

00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:11,380
why because during the migration from

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:15,070
the last the I can sorry for the story

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:18,190
the previous version of Europe items the

00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:21,730
European salad was based on the pikin

00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,750
italia site as the reason why we have

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:29,320
the commands in english anything em and

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:31,660
they use several apps application with a

00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:35,650
new version of europe item we just merge

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:38,830
them ok and the reason why we have some

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,830
duplicated cutter of course and i think

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:46,990
a synchronous no continuous integration

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:49,300
or and api for the external tools are

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:54,910
exactly that we have nothing okay

00:07:49,300 --> 00:08:01,560
but and no sister of course yes the

00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:06,400
settings are a cadet I think we have a

00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,460
but seriously I think we are not alone

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,940
in this case because I'm a freelancer

00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,820
with Python and when I go in some

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,320
companies I can see the same case the

00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:21,820
documentation and continuous integration

00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:26,320
server in fact nothing yes it works ok

00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:31,990
or I don't forget one thing because we

00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:36,550
are at Europe item Europe items a

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:41,040
started in 2002 and since the beginning

00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:46,510
we have a lot of former developers in

00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:49,590
reality 31 developers the secondly we

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:52,750
are some volunteers on the free time so

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:55,480
that we are not paid for that it's not

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,540
the case for the companies and we are

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:02,380
not where they're just data scientists

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:08,500
back in there we try to to fix the

00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:10,200
issues ok from that I think we have a

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,780
real challenge

00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,420
maybe us more maybe a big met we have

00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,170
read a challenge the third challenge is

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,300
to have a continuous integration server

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,230
ok we can install git lab we can use in

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:29,860
get lab or maybe trailers we see that in

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:33,610
the future we need documentation not in

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:38,830
Italian maybe in English why not in

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:40,480
Flemish but English is better for the

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,570
configuration that's very important

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,540
because currently the settings are just

00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,490
are coded in the South code that's why

00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:50,830
buying when you want you to move from

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,380
the production to the staging to the

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:57,580
production server that's very funny

00:09:53,380 --> 00:10:00,580
we need some tests maybe refactor into

00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:04,140
the dead code remove them of course

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,540
improve the quality of the curve so that

00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,520
that's very important the profiling

00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:12,070
sometimes we develop some application

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,690
with jungle but we don't use some tools

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:18,560
something

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,270
we need to improve the deployment I

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,450
don't know for you but I need some

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:28,260
companies they copy some script from a

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,420
YK wiki sorry and they passed all the

00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:35,520
lines in a shelf because they don't know

00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:38,779
fabric and unstable or szostak and we

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:41,880
need to monitor everything the website

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:44,850
he is responding or not to the database

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:50,100
there is a shutdown or not everything

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:51,990
about the continuous integration and we

00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,390
have good news I have a good news I've

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,200
started to use Twitter's just the

00:10:54,390 --> 00:11:00,720
configuration is not very difficult okay

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:06,029
further documentation was the best

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,399
project we want maybe things I like

00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:12,149
things because we have just the syntax

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:16,050
and we can extend it and because we have

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,810
a lot of plug-ins for jungle about the

00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:22,320
configuration we can start to to channel

00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:25,920
the South card and just you or just use

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,850
jungles and that answer is just a small

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,260
file where you input you put your

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:35,480
configuration you can see that in the

00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:37,709
part of the top where you give the

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,600
configuration for possible sequel for

00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:42,899
the secret for the day began their own

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,050
mount and the rest and in the bottom it

00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:48,480
just lines of code that you have to put

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,570
in your manage to tie that's right for

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,910
you with that you don't need to change

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,940
your configuration with the settings the

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,100
PI I have seen some developers they

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,470
comment the source code the settings and

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:08,640
try to use the other part for the test

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:11,070
please just please use unit test or PI

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:13,990
test don't try to make your own

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:21,700
framework and see that that's really

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:23,380
and it's just I you buy tests and I'm

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,020
going to show you that because yeah

00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:29,560
there is a funny good project by test

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:33,640
profiling but please use a framework

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:35,050
it's a battleground increment and don't

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,540
believe that your code is just perfect

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:42,970
we are humans and human make a lot of

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:45,940
error in this life of course so when we

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:50,080
create some tests how to create a test

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:53,500
we create a function for the set after

00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:56,020
we implement the code but we have a

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,080
legacy code is not the case you have the

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,380
legacy card and you have the tests you

00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,000
want try to write the test maybe you can

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,160
write the test in function of the code

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,070
coverage of your application in this

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:13,330
case you can use coverage or just if you

00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:15,970
are using a test by test curve that's

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,520
true just for the South Dakota but

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,850
sometimes you are using some template

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,060
and in the template you are not sure

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:28,540
that your template is just used with the

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:31,570
right function example you want to have

00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:35,010
a new parameter to your new an endpoint

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:37,779
and you have to check all the templates

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:40,839
okay you can try you can try to create

00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:43,630
tests for each template but there is a

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,930
plugin for that jungle coverage plug in

00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:50,260
this small plug-in will analyze the

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,270
template it will give you just a small

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:59,410
report okay there is an arrow in this

00:13:52,270 --> 00:14:06,070
case to that because we used version the

00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:07,839
version 1.8 since this version the

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,910
migration and Jana of jungle will

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,640
execute all the migration file and

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,970
sometimes that's very boring but with a

00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,480
DB because the test will take two

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,230
seconds

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,370
and the migration to it with just this

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,390
plug-in we can disable the migration

00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:32,720
when you try to write your test

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:35,510
but just more important as better for

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:44,000
the rest we have some mothers I suppose

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:46,690
we use the fixture bad sorry yes Advan

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,370
why because we have a static file and

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:51,560
when we had did the mother

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,190
we had a new field you have to update

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,940
your fixture I don't know for you but in

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,920
the companies where work they try to

00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,140
implement a small script where it will

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,520
put some values for the new field and

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:10,370
Mike is just use factory boy create a

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:13,190
factory for the mother and from that I

00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:18,740
can implement a new instance of my

00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:21,860
mother just when you write the code on

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,520
or when you want to refactor your color

00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:29,330
we can use pipe flake or just pile it

00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:31,940
just on linter where they tell you where

00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:35,870
you have an error in the source code for

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:39,560
example you just forget to declare

00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,880
variable use a variable but this one is

00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:46,340
not really it's not in the source code

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:49,490
when you develop you can use jungle PDB

00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,980
when you have an exception automatically

00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:54,140
DB we start it's a post more tender

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,120
automatically it will start on this line

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,370
where you have to issue the exception

00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,740
and you can start to debug don't just

00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:07,990
print present just from the beginners

00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:15,200
it's my case if you are using PI test

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:19,310
I'm going to use PGP PP because PDB or

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:26,390
IP DB just does not want does not work

00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:30,050
with a PI test of course because I'm a

00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:34,610
contributor of C Python C Python 3.6 and

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:36,710
3.7 I like to use my PI and we can use

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,630
my Phi might be just a small tool where

00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:40,910
we can check

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,430
the source code we can create an

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:47,030
animation analyze of the source code a

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:49,100
give a report where okay this variable

00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,640
is just a string but you want to assign

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:55,850
an integer it's not correct and my if I

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:58,520
can give us a report where we have the

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:03,740
duplicated code or just a duplicate

00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:07,130
function we can use auto flake Auto

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:12,949
flake is just a tool where it will

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:15,560
remove the unused import files from the

00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,829
South car and for the imports you can

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:21,650
use insert I thought will function of

00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:25,190
your configuration we solved in put the

00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:27,760
import file by three groups for example

00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:31,250
for the standard library for the

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:34,310
internet standard library the external

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:41,240
library Django and whatever and your

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:47,600
home library okay maybe jungle book

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:50,570
toolbar do you know oh they did a

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,610
profile an application with jungle in my

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,990
team

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:59,390
before I was a little they take time the

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:02,900
start time and they make the difference

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,930
between the start and stop just that but

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,900
we don't know the number of queries in

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:12,200
the database and about the CPU we have

00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:18,440
nothing it's really interesting I use it

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:22,940
I don't know for you when you run the

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:25,790
server with run server you can use

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:29,810
jungle jungle dev server and the line

00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:33,560
profile arrogance where you will get a

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:36,650
small report for the profile of the

00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:39,470
profiler and for each line we get we

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:42,650
will get the result for each line ok

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:45,110
this line after after takes two minutes

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,350
or two seconds sorry and the next line

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:52,680
with

00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:53,660
1 milliseconds the tray and important is

00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,210
for you

00:18:53,660 --> 00:19:02,070
height is profiling fighters profiling

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:05,160
is just a wrapper around see profile but

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:09,180
you have to interesting feature the

00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:12,860
first one is just provided VG with this

00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:16,140
feature we will create an SVG file and

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:21,180
will generate the lines where you can

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:25,110
see sorry actually you will have a file

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:28,560
a profile where you can execute tool to

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:30,510
show you the graph with the duration the

00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,020
course a number of course the times in

00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:36,810
the application and you can use the

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:40,200
second parameter just durations duration

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:43,530
will create we write a report where you

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,520
have in this case just the to slow wave

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:49,380
function in your source code I like that

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,430
because sometimes we can have this graph

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:56,490
I don't know for you sometimes you have

00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:58,140
a function you think it's a cpu-bound

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:02,550
ahead and like maybe there is a problem

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:06,650
with this nko with a DI you in my case

00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:06,650
that was just a program with my network

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:15,990
so I'm going to continue is profiling we

00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:19,920
can use C profile Z Z profile via just a

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:23,190
web interface for the profiles you can

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:26,760
see just a small screenshot where we

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:29,060
have all the stack trace and the course

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:35,100
for each function and the times just

00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:37,980
need to install it with web people so so

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,430
for the deployment while using dr. and

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,890
we use a compose but maybe in the future

00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,980
I would like to use Cuba net autocast

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:50,340
one because if we implement a new

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,460
feature we want to see hit before to put

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:55,680
it in the production server because we

00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,610
are some little person for the

00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:01,419
monitoring I would like to use

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:04,190
because currently we receive an email

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:07,130
just an email and we have no statistics

00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:10,130
about this exception nothing

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,850
sentry is really real really a good tool

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,570
for that

00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:17,240
maybe you supervisor should be able to

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:19,370
play a video update right or just a

00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,990
cubanelles of the class one because it

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:24,470
can restart if there is a crash of the

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:28,370
process and for the rest nachos or

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,970
chicken so next one is just the State of

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,220
the Union

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:38,480
after this refactoring because I did it

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:42,350
I have added Travis we have some tests

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:47,389
ninety seven tests are a big better is a

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:52,870
better than zero we have Co coverage 32%

00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:56,779
32% on 27,000 line squad that's good

00:21:52,870 --> 00:22:00,350
in one week I think it's good started to

00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:02,299
port the database to Postgres equal the

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:05,960
source code start to be compatible with

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:07,850
over sequel and of course sometimes I

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,940
use a profiling because I have observed

00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,460
some difference with the speed in

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:18,590
function if we use SQLite of course

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:22,370
equal next step just just add

00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:26,149
documentation remove the dead car moved

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,789
the last version of jungle jungle to

00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:30,649
zero or one goes Helen

00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:32,779
I prefer John John go to the zero

00:22:30,649 --> 00:22:35,240
because we will remove the support of

00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:38,899
white on to of course

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:41,210
Python use Python 3.6 because we have

00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:45,190
some improvement and mainly with the

00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:49,659
last version of Python Python 23.7 and

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:51,169
someone's use Postgres because progress

00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:54,159
is progress

00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:57,830
just pick the perfect database for me

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,010
useful Airy maybe we will provide some

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,889
API because currently you know why the

00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:05,690
schedule in your application is not

00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:08,000
synchronous synchronized with the applet

00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,889
with the website because every day we

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,320
just export the schedule from the

00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,090
database

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:22,310
to the application and maybe create a

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:25,650
single-page app so there is an expert a

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:30,780
jungle explained in the room because

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:33,210
maybe we need your help because we are

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:36,000
volunteer we don't have a free time we

00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:39,990
are not paid for the Europe item site

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,070
it's just on the free time but maybe we

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,950
you have a better experience than me

00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:50,130
also contribute during this weekend we

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:55,160
will do a spring coat please come on

00:23:50,130 --> 00:24:00,870
please I don't want to be alone okay

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:02,340
please come join the web team and if you

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:06,450
are better than me

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:11,940
please share your best practice you have

00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:15,540
a survey we can go just read it if tiny

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:19,920
rail comes last jungle - best - practice

00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:22,460
and if you have a question at the tile

00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,460
at the moment

00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:39,570
okay who has a question this sort is

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:43,290
just my experience in one month okay I

00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:47,460
never used jungle before and I don't

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:50,040
know if I derived the right practice for

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,180
the project but in my case because I

00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:59,510
already use some other tools in the past

00:24:53,180 --> 00:25:02,750
just use these tours okay no question

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:06,140
yes just one

00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:06,140
I'm in time

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,190
yeah so first you can run by test with

00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,530
type A to B is just minus s or minus

00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:23,240
minus capture equals to know which will

00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,130
want to redirect the sed out so

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:28,610
everything's working with by test an IP

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:32,090
DB and seconds here you consider the

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:35,780
whole team to use at least some Django

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:38,260
CMS or what they'll as based on top of

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,510
which you can build the conference thing

00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:45,440
for the second question we use dongho

00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:49,250
C&S all right for the first sorry can

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,780
you repeat there was a slide that you

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:55,340
said you cannot run by test with IP DB

00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:58,190
because you get some strange event loop

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:01,400
error but when I guess with the certain

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:05,240
flag maybe you can show me because when

00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,850
I started to use IP DB we've by test I

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,420
don't know why but sometimes I get some

00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:13,580
some error in my console but if you have

00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,400
a solution I'm ready to mobility for

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,900
failing but yes okay okay another

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,950
question all right I think we've got

00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,190
time for one more

00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:29,080
I'm sorry we've got time for more

00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:29,080
questions so ah all right

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:36,460
and as far as eliminating dead quote

00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:38,350
there is a very good tool called vulture

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,359
and it doesn't catch us to be everything

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,039
for obvious reasons for Sam it does

00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:44,970
catch an awful lot of stuff it was

00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,809
static code analysis on code base and

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,809
that should be useful

00:26:46,809 --> 00:26:52,149
can you show me because yeah I come on

00:26:49,809 --> 00:27:01,899
all right do we have a question that is

00:26:52,149 --> 00:27:05,259
a question yeah yeah there is vulture

00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:09,880
just forget to explain it but yeah it's

00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:16,380
a good project us also thank you

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:16,380
