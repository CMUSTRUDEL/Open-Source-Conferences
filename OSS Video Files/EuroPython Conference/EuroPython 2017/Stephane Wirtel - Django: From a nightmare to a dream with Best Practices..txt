	"Django: From a nightmare to a dream with Best Practices.
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 1]
[Rimini, Italy]

With the adventure in the source code of the site of EuroPython, we have detected that the code was difficult to maintain. With the members of the Web team, we have started to refactor the code with the best practices and good concept. Also, we will see some awesome libraries for the Django project.

In brief, you have a legacy code and you want to improve it with best practices, then this talk is for you. 

You don't want to break it but you don't want to change it because you can break it at all times, we will show you how to improve an existing code with some tools and best practices, and your code can be deploy on Friday evening with no risk.

From a nightmare to a dream.

Keywords, TDD, Refactoring, Tests, BDD, Selenium, CI, and many more...
