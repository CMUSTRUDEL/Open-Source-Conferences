Many times data visualizations need to communicate insights clearly and effectively. But sometimes the goals of a visualization go beyond that: they need to inspire and engage people. But how do you draw them in? What is the process behind creating a creative data visualization? During this talk, I will show some of my projects, and explain a little about the process behind it.



Peter Hoffmann - Infrastructure as Python Code: Run your Services on Microsoft Azure

"Infrastructure as Python Code: Run your Services on Microsoft Azure
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Anfiteatro 1]
[Rimini, Italy]

Using Infrastructure-as-Code principles with configuration through machine processable definition files in combination with the adoption of cloud computing provides faster feedback cycles in development/testing and less risk in deployment to production. The Microsoft Azure Cloud (https://azure.microsoft.com/) allows different ways to provision, deploy and run your python  service:


The Azure Resource Manger Templates (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/) allows you to provision your application using a declarative template. With parameters, variables and Azure template functions, the same template can be used to deploy your application in different stages (dev, test, production) and environments for different customers. We open sourced the tropo library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tropo/) to create Azure Resource Templates from python.
Azure SDK for Python (http://azure-sdk-for-python.readthedocs.io) for a low level access to manage resources in the Azure Cloud.
An Azure Ansible Module (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/guide_azure.html) based on the Azure SDK to automate software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment in a single environment.


Each of the alternatives has different strengths and drawbacks. Presenting our learnings from migrating our infrastructure into the Azrue Cloud will help to avoid common pitfalls and show deployment patterns that will ease the live of devops.

	00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:12,330
morning everyone how are you doing

00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:22,289
enjoying a conference yeah good yeah so

00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:28,890
my name is Yamato and I thought instead

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:33,300
of just telling what what I do I thought

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:36,390
maybe it's a nice idea if if I try to

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,640
find out what people think that I do so

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:42,449
I went to my Twitter account and quite

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,039
I've quite a following by now and quite

00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:46,979
a few people have added me to a list and

00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:50,069
these lists are named list and so I

00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:53,609
extracted some of the words people have

00:00:50,069 --> 00:00:55,350
been using to name their list and then I

00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:59,819
just looked at the frequency of those

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:04,019
words and I'm very happy to announce

00:00:59,819 --> 00:01:05,610
that one third of the words that have

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:06,810
been used in those lists is data

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,840
visualization which is actually what I

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,610
do some other words that are related to

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,950
what I do is data of data signs

00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,650
sometimes design infographics

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:21,300
data-driven journalism I can hear you

00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:23,990
thinking why is this guy on stage

00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:29,160
because with this is a patent conference

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:31,370
but in 0.4% people I've also added me to

00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,140
your list where Python was in the name

00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:38,340
that so I have a reason to be here I

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:41,610
think but actually I use Python for all

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,770
of my projects I use it to prepare my

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,630
datasets before I actually create a

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,240
visualization so I'm actually a Python

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,750
user but I don't we do lot about it so

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,080
that probably explains but so let's get

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,600
started so first let's just take the

00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:00,300
time and think about the word archive

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,900
and come up with some associations let

00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:06,540
emotions flow what kind of feelings do

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:10,819
you have our word archive good ones

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,819
something anyone

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm sorry Alden dusty yeah I think

00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,850
that's probably one of the most common

00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,340
things where people or people think of

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,080
you also have your email archive which

00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,970
is also kind of place where you put your

00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,800
emails where you don't when you don't

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:32,430
want to read them anymore but you store

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,110
them just in case but yeah there are

00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,480
also these physical archives and I think

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:41,069
most people think well these are kind of

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,800
old dusty locations where people store

00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,630
books and it's not it's maybe a little

00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,810
bit cold because of the the temperature

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:51,390
control so not the most funny place to

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,459
be probably but that's not true for

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,200
every archive and I want to talk about

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,720
one archive in particular which is the

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:03,959
state archive for Dutch architecture and

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:06,560
urban planning and this is quite an

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:11,100
interesting archive because it contains

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,739
about 150 years of Dutch architecture

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,600
and in this archive is maintained by a

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,790
museum called the new Institute and

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,350
Rotterdam and it's actually not an

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,590
archive it's a collection of archive

00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:24,780
because when an architecture or an

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,760
architect's architect organization

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,860
decides well we have an archive and we

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,980
want people we want to have it

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:35,519
maintained and they transfer it to to

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,410
the new Institute and last year the

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,900
Dutch national government also assigned

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,060
the status of national heritage - to

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,810
this archive so it really is an

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,600
important and valuable archive which is

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,799
kind of a small piece of the collective

00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:54,000
memory of of the Dutch

00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,700
inside this archive there are a lot of

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,209
photographs sketches models books

00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:05,220
reports all kinds of documents so it's

00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,870
really a big archive it's the biggest

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,329
architecture archive in the Netherlands

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,530
and even one of the biggest in the world

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:15,600
and the new Institute has put quite a

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,519
bit of effort in making the archive

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,090
accessible online so you can go to the

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,380
website and then you you will visit this

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:24,600
page you and

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:29,070
in this page and you can enter a search

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:32,070
word a keyword at the top of your of

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,770
your screen and then all the archives

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,270
that match your keyword will show up in

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,340
resolve list and on the left you see

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,960
some facets well it's a very common way

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,550
of searching and then if you click on

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,800
one of the archives you get a detailed

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:45,810
page specifically for the archive and

00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,580
there are all the documents that you can

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,380
well some of them you can look at

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,030
because they have some scans other ones

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,280
you can well at least you can make a

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,570
reservation so that you can go to your

00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,390
kife and have a look at it and this way

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,420
if searching is really common this is a

00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,360
Dutch house search website and on the

00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:09,120
right is a car searching website

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,130
autoscout and you basically you do the

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,130
same thing you say you know what you're

00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:17,010
looking for this is I can I can pay this

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:20,160
this amount of mortgage I'm looking for

00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:22,070
a house with three rooms and what are

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,930
the results and then you you narrow down

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,910
the search base and same goes for a car

00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,520
I want a diesel car it's should be

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,550
station from this year and you also

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:37,170
narrow down this search space and it's

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,330
very effective way of searching through

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,370
a large collection of data but there is

00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:43,290
one big assumption here and that is that

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,830
you know what you're looking for and

00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:49,830
that's not always the case my wife and I

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,720
are almost in stages for looking for a

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,210
new house because our house is becoming

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,490
a little bit too small but one of the

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,470
things that I'm personally interested in

00:05:56,490 --> 00:06:00,000
is the house that I've in mind what are

00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:02,250
the chances that I find it in the

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,590
location where I would like to live

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,420
should I look somewhere else or should I

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,310
look for a different type of house or

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:12,270
something like that and same goes for a

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,130
car if how unique is my search what are

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,530
some alternatives that are easier to

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:19,470
find those kind of questions and also

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,900
the the more general sense of what does

00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,940
the data set look like it that's really

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,690
hard to do with with a search interface

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:31,470
like this and one of the ways that you

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:33,650
can access data and search through data

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:35,840
and get a better sense of the overall

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:39,440
contents of a data set is by

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,090
using data visualization and when I

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,680
think of data visualization I think of

00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,120
something like this when you look at

00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,790
this picture you see a lot of people

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,669
walking there's a lot of things going on

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:53,720
and if you would want to make sense of

00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:55,130
it it's a little bit difficult but there

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,220
is a Dutch photographer and this

00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,690
photographer travels the world and he he

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,419
goes to cities and there he takes

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,400
pictures of people and he publishes them

00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:07,460
on his website and his books but he does

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,460
it like this and I think this is really

00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,020
amazing because he groups them by the

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,180
way people dress and suddenly people

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,100
start to become part of a group that

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,530
they were not aware of and this is

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:20,419
exactly the same thing what a data

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,370
visualization designer does you look at

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:24,460
a data set and you try to come up with a

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,669
design that shows some structure and

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:32,150
some some outliers and and allows you to

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:36,919
see some patterns in the data set now

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:40,130
every data visualization can contains

00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,860
three components and you might you might

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,950
label them with three questions what why

00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,100
and how and what is the data that you're

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:51,320
looking at what is represented the why

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,880
is why is a user using a data

00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,039
visualization what should you get out of

00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:58,220
it what are the questions that he should

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,320
answer with the visualization and the

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,470
how is the visual design and the

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,060
interactions and these are also the

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,200
areas where it can go wrong if you have

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,580
the wrong data set then your

00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,220
visualization is wrong if you ask the

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:12,289
wrong questions it's not right and also

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,820
if you have the right questions right

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,680
data but you're not showing it correctly

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,180
it also goes wrong and these are also

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,039
the areas where you can improve things

00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,410
if you improve the quality of your data

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,760
if you ask better questions or if you

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,979
make a better design then your

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:28,639
visualization will improve so this is

00:08:24,979 --> 00:08:32,240
part of every visualization so let's

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:36,770
talk about the concept for the

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,169
architecture archives the new Institute

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,969
approached me and asked me well we have

00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,520
this big archive and we would like to

00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:47,660
know what does it look like that was

00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,950
their question and it is actually a very

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,700
good question to start a data

00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,990
visualization

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:56,510
process because when you when you start

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,580
a data visualization process sometimes

00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,010
people think that well you just think of

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,750
a design and you build it or design it

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:04,670
and implement it and that's it but

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,100
that's not the case you sometimes I

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,870
describe what I do is finding a visual

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,760
representation of a data set that works

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:12,710
for a particular situation you always

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,690
have to discover what works and what

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,160
doesn't work so this question is really

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,140
good because it gives you a direction

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,750
but at the same time it doesn't tell me

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,100
what it should look like but at the same

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,850
time it was still a little bit too

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,430
abstract for me so I came up with two

00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,460
sub questions and one is what does the

00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,440
contents of the archive look like and

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:36,590
more specifically are there archives

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:40,070
that are similar if you look at their

00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:43,660
contents and the other one is what is

00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,660
the structure of the archive look like

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:49,250
now let's look at have a look at the

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,410
data of the architecture archive if you

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,270
look at the website this is a detail

00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:54,980
page of one of the archives there are

00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:58,010
several components that are already

00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,330
visible that are can be used as a data

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,640
set

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,650
first there's a title it has an

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,650
identifier your title and then after the

00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,200
slash you see the type of archive then

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:11,300
there's some other metadata for instance

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,610
the period the archive is about or the

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,440
size and just for your information the

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,810
physical size of the archive there are

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,360
there are archives that are over 250

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:23,840
meters long so that's really a big

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,160
archive and then this was really the

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,960
part that was most interesting to me

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,300
because this is a tree structure similar

00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:33,560
to do folders and files on your hard

00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:35,300
disk and also all these all these

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:39,580
elements in these three structures had

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,600
labels and that's what I could use for

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,580
understanding the contents of the

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:49,130
archive now this is a Dutch sentence but

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,470
this is an example of the of a title

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,650
that was there and what I wanted to do

00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,350
is was extract some some kind of

00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:59,960
informative words so I did some natural

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,970
language processing on this data and I

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,889
wanted to extract the nouns and for

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,439
and the morphology so the combination of

00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:08,449
words I wanted to extract them get rid

00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:10,939
of punctuation get rid of numbers and

00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:14,089
things like that here's another one I

00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:16,240
also wanted to know if something was a

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:18,980
person like from how it is a person

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,709
middle on CJ that's Mediterranean so

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,180
that's that's a location and so these

00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,009
are all the kind of things that I wanted

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:31,480
to extract so that I could get a better

00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:34,730
sense of what is this archive about only

00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:37,939
if we can have before I had to deliver

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:41,480
the project I came across this one I've

00:11:37,939 --> 00:11:43,579
been using a Python Python package

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,980
called pattern which you may know for a

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:48,879
language processing but the thing is

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,860
that many of these language processing

00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,209
tools are very good at English and

00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,980
sometimes they also support other

00:11:53,209 --> 00:11:58,310
languages and they are reasonably

00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,500
supported so better'n works really okay

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,879
but I had to do a lot of work in order

00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,779
to make it right and then I came across

00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:08,240
this and this was developed by two Dutch

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:10,220
universities specifically for Dutch so

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,939
this worked extremely well the only

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,220
thing is that the original language you

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:19,790
are processing if that's not a really

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:21,259
good grammatical Dutch then the result

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,480
is also not very good and it was also

00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,069
quite often the case because those

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,079
titles were just descriptions and

00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:29,059
sometimes it was just cover 1 cover to

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,040
cover 3 so that doesn't really tell you

00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:35,720
something so there was still a bit of a

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,160
challenge so for the visual design I

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,250
would like to give a live demo of the

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:52,639
result and I cannot see my screen so I

00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:54,379
have to switch to so this is the the end

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,269
result this is the first part this is

00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:58,250
the content of the archive and what you

00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:01,100
see right here is these are the archives

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,850
and they are clustered by similarity

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:07,490
based on their contents and they're also

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:09,889
colored and positioned based on that if

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,660
you hover over an archive you can see

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:13,279
the name of your archive on top and

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,179
below that you see the three most

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:20,199
frequent words on the left and on the

00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:22,759
right you see two lists of words and

00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:24,319
those morphologies I mentioned the

00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:26,230
combination of words that's what I'm

00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:29,179
showing here because I was interesting

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,370
there's for instance the word building

00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:33,170
occurred many times but there's a hotel

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,759
building there a Congress building

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,120
there's all kinds of building so I

00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:40,220
wanted to get a better sense of all

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,910
those types of buildings so on the left

00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,519
you see a list of words that parts of

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,079
words where that's are the beginnings of

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,490
bigger words and on the right you see

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,029
parts where there are the endings of

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:58,220
bigger words so here you see for

00:13:52,029 --> 00:14:00,860
instance for instance project so you

00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,569
have project documentation or project

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,490
correspondence or something like that

00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:09,230
so and if you click on it you can see

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:15,230
where in which archives these words

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:19,579
occur and the same goes for for the ones

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:21,379
where the words are ending on a part of

00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:24,079
a word and then you can see where it

00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:27,800
occurs the other part of the

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,139
visualization was about the the

00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,329
structure of the archives and once you

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,220
click on a visualization you can see

00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:36,019
what the structure of the visualization

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,000
looks like and this is one of the

00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:41,509
visualizations and over here you see

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,029
it's actually just a line chart where

00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:46,879
you can select different archives and

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:51,670
it's based on the number of nodes in the

00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:54,439
network so here are the bigger archives

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:56,149
and personally I think this is very

00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:59,720
interesting because this is some kind of

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,840
signature image of each archive each

00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,700
archive

00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,700
unique appearance

00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:22,260
so let me switch back to my slice now as

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,910
I mentioned briefly I when I start a

00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,029
visualization project I need to get a

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,730
sense of a data set so I usually try to

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:31,769
visualize data really soon in the

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:34,890
process and here are some sketches of

00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:38,040
the visualization that I did just to get

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:39,570
a sense of is this big data set is there

00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,060
a lot of variety and things like that

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,850
and what worked visually because I also

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,560
have in the back of my mind the idea

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,970
that I need to communicate it and it

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,089
needs to look nice so it's not just

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,010
about what's what's correct or something

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:56,660
like that or most effective but what's

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:59,820
also nice to look at so here are some

00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,589
different ways to look at maybe the same

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:05,370
archive but using different algorithms

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:08,490
to to show a network and it was just

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:13,230
yeah trying out what works what doesn't

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:16,290
work what looks nice so these could all

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:18,300
be the same archive but looking

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:20,640
completely different and this one for

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,829
example I thought this is not really

00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,630
working you see one archive which has a

00:16:22,829 --> 00:16:30,839
lot of nodes at one level deep but

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:32,790
there's a small exception there and so I

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:37,860
thought this was not the best solution

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:39,899
so but also the clustering was a kind of

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,940
exploratory process because there are so

00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:44,190
many parameters you can play with the

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,649
strength of the attraction and repulsion

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:48,600
of the nodes in the network the size of

00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,029
the node so here everything is shown at

00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:55,529
once here's one big cluster on the right

00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:57,029
here's only a cluster in the center and

00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:59,360
one sand on the outside are not

00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:03,209
connected which is also not very good

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,429
here everything is one big blob in the

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:09,059
center but also the styling how do you

00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:12,870
show the different nodes do you just use

00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:14,520
transparency should I show the links

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:17,600
between the nodes so that you better see

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:21,480
the connections may be a combination

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:25,299
what if I show just the

00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:29,110
or reduce have a fixed radius for every

00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:31,960
every circle and also the the natural

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,390
language process provided me with lists

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,279
of verbs nouns adjectives and things

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,860
like that and also persons and locations

00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,779
so one of the ideas that I have was

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:44,020
maybe I should offer the user an option

00:17:40,779 --> 00:17:46,090
to to dynamically cluster the network

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:48,309
based on nouns or adjectives or

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,919
something like that and this one for

00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:53,049
instance is based on persons and it it

00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,320
actually shows that the person is very

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,970
much related to one archive and not to

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,950
other archive which makes sense an

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,399
archive is about one architect or I

00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,809
could architect your organization so and

00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:06,760
even those connections may be

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:08,770
coincidence because maybe two people

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,770
have the same name so it's not even the

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:15,520
same person so I decided not to do this

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:18,429
in the end and this is just these are

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:21,520
just a few examples and also the

00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:23,919
highlight color what should be white or

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,760
does that work I also had the idea of

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,220
showing the the most frequent word per

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,470
cluster but I decided not to because it

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,419
to me it was kind of too much of a

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,760
reduction to a single word where there

00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:39,100
was really a lot of variety in the in

00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,770
words that were used in the archives so

00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,539
I decided not to do this and also the

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,830
line chart you saw at the bottom of the

00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:50,200
of the year of the new rotating network

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:52,059
so this was another example and I was

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,429
looking for a visual representation of

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:57,610
of that where it didn't interfere with

00:18:54,429 --> 00:18:59,260
the rotating Network and and didn't take

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,929
up too much space because the rotating

00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,240
network was the main point of that view

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:06,340
so so it's really a lot of experimenting

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:12,549
and trying things out and see what works

00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:16,600
and what doesn't work so what makes the

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:19,450
data visualization interesting now there

00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,940
are researchers in social shine science

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:25,240
that are trying to figure this out what

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:27,580
makes something interesting and there

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,200
are at least two challenges people

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,090
differ in what they may find interesting

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,919
and what's interesting now may not be

00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,760
interesting in the future but these

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,470
researchers

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,310
do some experiments and I would like to

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,020
try this experiment with you I've done

00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:43,480
it a few times in the past and most of

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:45,940
the time it's successful but sometimes

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,250
it's not so don't feel guilty if the

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,990
experiment fails so what I'm going to do

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:52,030
is I'm going to show you a visualization

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,100
and what I want you to do is to rate

00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:57,040
this visualization on the scale from one

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:59,560
to ten with one being not interesting at

00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,900
all and ten extremely interesting for

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:04,270
whatever reason and that's just it so

00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:10,480
just give a number interesting do you

00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:11,950
think this is well you don't have to you

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,700
don't have to mention it's just for

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,170
yourself I think everybody has a number

00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,460
okay let me explain a little bit about

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:20,920
this visualization this is a

00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,000
visualization done by Boris Muller and

00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,770
he is a professor of information

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,890
visualization at the University of

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,990
Potsdam in Germany and he created this

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:33,250
visualization and it is part of a

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,540
festival called poetry on the road for

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,090
several years he has been asked to

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:40,510
create a visualization based on the

00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:42,490
actual poems of the festival and this

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,850
visualization was used on the poster

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:48,100
that was used to announce the the

00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:51,220
festival and what you see right here is

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:53,290
that every circle every big circle is

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,470
one poem and the bigger the circle the

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:58,450
longer the poem and then he came up with

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,540
an idea where you assign a number to

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,490
letter so a is 1 B is 2 C's 3 etc and

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,550
then for every word he summed up those

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,010
numbers and well each circle is actually

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:13,690
a scale with 0 on the top and then based

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:16,480
on the sum of these numbers the words

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,580
the red dots are representations were so

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,740
they're putting on a radial scale and

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,150
then the sizes of the red circles are

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,270
bigger if more words have the same

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:29,830
number and then the grey lines are used

00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:32,800
to connect the poem in the original

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,740
order or the words in the original order

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,230
of the poem so now that you know a

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:39,870
little bit more about

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,030
the how you could read this

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,730
visualization who made it what it was

00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:54,320
used for how would you rate the

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:54,320
visualization now for who did it go up

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:03,200
quite a few for who did it go down also

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:06,270
quite a few for who did it say the same

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,710
it's also quite a few I I couldn't I

00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:11,690
really couldn't tell if there's a

00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,860
majority or not the idea is that

00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,140
interestingness according to the

00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,970
researchers has two main components the

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,559
first one is novelty which is what we

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,840
usually think of when something is

00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:25,140
interesting because it's surprising it's

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,610
new it's unexpected but there's another

00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,530
component to it which is just as

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,760
important which is comprehensibility so

00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:33,419
you have to understand what you're

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,130
looking at the pupil is in a some kind

00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:37,830
of diagram you can think of it like this

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,660
if something is very common and it's

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,340
comprehensible then it's a little bit

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,990
boring you can think of bar charge for

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,820
instance they're very effective

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,380
everybody understands them they're used

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,960
all the time but at the same time

00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:53,030
they're also a little bit boring if

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:55,770
something is incomprehensible but also

00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:58,260
novel maybe the visualization I just

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,150
showed you it can be very beautiful but

00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,150
you can think what am I looking at it's

00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:04,590
looks nice but I don't know what it is

00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:07,710
if it's common and if it's

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,230
incomprehensible then it's a failure and

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:11,940
you can think of those as visualizations

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,890
for instance a pie chart where the

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,610
segment's don't add up to 100%

00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:19,559
that's kind of manipulating and well if

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:23,370
it's comprehensible and novel then it

00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:28,559
should be interesting so let me tell you

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:29,910
about another project I did and this is

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,200
a project I did for the European Space

00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:36,000
Agency and it's about this satellite and

00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,530
the satellite is called Hipparchus and

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,890
if our course is a satellite that was in

00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:43,260
space a few years ago I don't know if it

00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:46,450
still is but at least the a few years

00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:51,580
ago it made measurements about stars

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:54,310
and all the data collected was ended up

00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:58,210
in a large catalogue that is both

00:23:54,310 --> 00:24:00,220
available digitally and in printed

00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:03,130
formats where you have several volumes

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,990
with lots of tables and diagrams and it

00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:10,330
was at that time the largest store

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:11,920
catalogue of the world and inside this

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:14,850
catalog you can see diagrams like this

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:17,500
where you can see locations of stars

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,870
brightness of stars where the stars are

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:21,520
moving or not and things like that or

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:26,200
the direction they are moving because

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,540
they're all moving and when the European

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,880
Space Agency approached me they wanted

00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,710
to they asked me if I could create a

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,020
visualization that communicated what

00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:37,540
what is a star catalog what's in it

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,370
because the European Space Agency is an

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:41,710
international government-funded

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,030
organization and one of they're one of

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,710
the things that they also do is is

00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:46,900
communicate to the outside world what

00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:52,300
they're doing so they have a group of

00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,520
people that work with education so to

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:59,530
explain to students what's what they're

00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:01,810
doing and a large communication part in

00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:03,280
their organization and they also did a

00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:05,500
little bit of research what was already

00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:08,080
out there with regards to interactive

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,270
visualization of star catalogs and there

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,360
wasn't very much at the time so there

00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:16,810
was one if you look for instance on

00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,970
google for stellar motion you don't find

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:21,070
a lot of results and also on youtube you

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,930
find a few animations and this is one of

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:26,140
them where you see one constellation and

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:28,420
it moves over a hundred thousand year

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,970
period and then it changes shape and

00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:33,130
that's but that's about it so I thought

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,750
there was quite a bit of an opportunity

00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:37,050
there to create an interactive

00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,050
visualization

00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,940
[Music]

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:56,160
so this is the starting screen of the

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:58,830
star catalogue visualization and what

00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,740
you see here on screen is on the right

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:04,620
you always have a short explanation of

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:08,250
what you're actually looking at here on

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,450
top you see some small suggestions from

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,700
how you could interact with the

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,550
visualization here on the lower left you

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,160
have bottoms buttons to turn on star

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:19,110
names or constellations and here at the

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,240
bottom of the screen you have a few

00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,120
sections where where I will go through

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,260
that that shows you several aspects of

00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:30,960
star catalog and each of those views has

00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:33,480
small control to interact with the

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,490
visualization and this particular view

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,410
is about the apparent magnitude and

00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,660
that's the brightness of the star as you

00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:41,490
would see them from Earth and with this

00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,740
slider you can change the brightness of

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:50,550
the star so these are all the stars that

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:53,040
the that the satellites measured and you

00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:55,920
can also move around in space and you

00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:57,660
can zoom in and zoom out and personally

00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,660
I think it's quite interesting to see

00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,710
when you turn on the constellation that

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:04,860
especially when you zoom out you see

00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,570
that they the choice of stars of a

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,350
constellation was really a human choice

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:13,080
in a specific moment in time where it

00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:15,030
made sense to based on what I saw from

00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:20,130
Earth but not not necessarily from the

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:23,310
distance from Earth so another view is

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,140
the absolute magnitude and that's the

00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,950
brightness of the stars as if they are

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,450
from a fixed distance from Earth and

00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:33,030
here you can switch between them and you

00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:34,890
can see that I become most of them

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:38,100
become bigger and brighter some of them

00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:41,390
become smaller and but what I'm actually

00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:44,010
doing is when you zoom out you can see

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,810
you can see the result I'm actually

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:49,650
placing all the stars at a fixed

00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:50,390
location so that's how the brightness of

00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,890
the star

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:58,250
changes or in order to explain a concept

00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:02,180
of the absolute magnitude there's

00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:03,560
another diagram which is often used by

00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,740
astronomers and it's the

00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:09,020
hertzsprung-russell diagram and on

00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,390
y-axis you see the absolute magnitudes

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:14,690
and on x-axis you see the temperature

00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:16,190
and you can here switch between white

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,720
and color and the colors based on the

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,640
temperature and for astronomers this

00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,440
this diagram is interesting because it

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,300
the location of a star in this diagram

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,310
tells you something about the lifecycle

00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:29,930
of a star the next view is about stellar

00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:32,330
motion and then what I've done here is

00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:34,670
I've created a stereographic projection

00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:35,690
so when you zoom in here you can see it

00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:37,790
especially if I turn on the

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,920
constellations in a previous one you saw

00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,300
that the constellation were distorting

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,290
and here they just become bigger and

00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:49,490
smaller so here again you can zoom in

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:52,970
move around but here you can simulate

00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:58,670
how stars would move over time so you

00:28:52,970 --> 00:29:05,000
can move forward and backwards in time

00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:10,130
and I don't know five good example right

00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:12,080
here but yeah over here you see it for

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:14,300
instance this is what's quite

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,510
interesting that some klar starts moving

00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:21,410
in clusters so that's quite interesting

00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:23,450
to to notice and finally there's a few

00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,220
where you can play with all the controls

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:28,400
at once so you can turn on more stars

00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:30,680
you can make them color it you can set

00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,550
the turn on a motion and you can switch

00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:41,380
between 3d and the stereographic

00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:41,380
projection now there's a nice cluster

00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:52,950
so this is the star mapper for European

00:29:50,280 --> 00:30:01,530
Space Agency and the reason why I showed

00:29:52,950 --> 00:30:03,780
you this is because maybe someone is

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:06,900
thirsty I don't know but the reason is

00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:09,570
this is an example of storytelling with

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,220
data and storytelling with data is a

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,630
little bit different than literary

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,130
storytelling where you usually have a

00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:17,400
main character that goes through an

00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:19,440
adventure and that's it's really a

00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,600
chronological sequence of events but

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,940
with data that's not really the case

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,309
with data you tell a story and you use

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:28,309
data to support your story and

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,900
researchers have looked at a lot of

00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,030
visualization and discovered that

00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,610
several models have been used over and

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,200
over again and if three of them are very

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:42,900
popular and this is one of them and this

00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,750
is called the martini glass model and

00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,370
it's called this way because well

00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:49,320
martini glass is an arrow first and then

00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:51,630
it widens up and that's exactly the way

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,679
the individualization is structured

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:58,230
first I showed very limited views you

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,270
had only one option to interact with the

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,820
visualization it was only about one

00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,050
topic so it's really focused and then

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,640
you move on to the next which is the

00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,650
same so you're in a narrow part of the

00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,690
martini glass and then in the final view

00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:11,309
it opens up and then you can play with

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,870
all everything all at once

00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,640
and the reason why you want to do that

00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,080
is because if if you want to explain

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,300
something to a user using a

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,130
visualization you and it's a little bit

00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,679
more complex you usually don't want to

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:25,080
throw the visualization Edmund for him

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:26,670
to figure it out himself you want a guy

00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,250
to use it through the process a little

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:31,530
bit and explain to him what he should

00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:32,910
look at so at the end when you can play

00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:33,630
with everything at once you should know

00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:36,059
okay

00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:39,590
this is what I'm looking at and this is

00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:39,590
what what's happening right now

00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:49,740
another way to to create interesting or

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,640
engaging visualization is this project

00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:56,100
does anyone have an idea how many trees

00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:10,290
there are in the world the total number

00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:13,230
of trees 5 almost anyone oh let me

00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:20,400
reveal the result it's three point zero

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:22,170
four trillion trees if you would chop

00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,350
down one tree every second it would take

00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:27,870
you about 100,000 years to chop down

00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:30,750
every tree so it's still a big number

00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,690
but maybe a little bit more

00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,460
understandable and a really big number

00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:37,890
this was the topic of a research that

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,070
has been done and was published in

00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:43,560
Nature magazine and the researchers

00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,840
before the study the researchers only

00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,940
used satellite images to to make an

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,980
estimate of the total number of trees in

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,960
the world but for this research they did

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,730
something different for this research

00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:59,460
they also dispatched people so and they

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:01,320
had those people count trees so whenever

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,390
they looked at a satellite image they

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,400
were much more certain that this was an

00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:12,180
accurate estimate of this number of

00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:14,520
trees and nature magazine was publishing

00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:17,880
this research and they wanted an

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:19,260
animation for this to showcase this

00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,300
research and they approached me and

00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,490
asked me if I could do that using a

00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,000
visualization and let me show you the

00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,000
animation

00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:45,650
[Music]

00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:12,370
because trees each language is

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,840
represented by the height every night

00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:17,149
some of the deadlifts area released

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:20,200
subarctic forest where you can find a

00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:20,200
tree in this world

00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,570
Oh

00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,429
[Music]

00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:57,099
[Music]

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,980
[Music]

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,959
[Music]

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,860
[Music]

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:50,880
so for these projects I received the

00:35:48,779 --> 00:35:55,529
data set and you're looking at it right

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,539
now it was an image but it was a kind of

00:35:55,529 --> 00:36:02,130
special image because this was one

00:35:57,539 --> 00:36:06,380
gigabyte in size and the reason is that

00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:09,630
you can zoom in and zoom in and zoom in

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:13,829
until we end up with one pixel which is

00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:20,369
one square kilometer so the researchers

00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:20,849
have been able to to create a map of the

00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:22,829
earth

00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:25,079
with a resolution of one square

00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:27,839
kilometer and for each square kilometer

00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:32,999
they were able to estimate the density

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:35,130
of trees which is really amazing when I

00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:37,680
created this visualization I was looking

00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:40,710
for a kind of view like this when I

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,029
think of trees I I thought maybe I want

00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,180
something like this so it's green but

00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:46,680
it's also a little bit bumpy and that's

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,900
what I had in mind when I wanted to

00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,579
create this visualization so I started

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,489
out first at the old the coordinates

00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:55,710
mixed up so but then I ended up with the

00:36:53,489 --> 00:37:00,059
original idea that I had in mind which

00:36:55,710 --> 00:37:03,150
was also failure because what I had in

00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:05,130
mind was just show only the trees on the

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,410
globe but a transparent globe and

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,380
displays the dots based on the density

00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:14,309
but as you can see this image totally

00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:16,829
doesn't make sense so yeah I quickly

00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:19,049
moved on to a solid globe and and two

00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:22,079
bars to show the the density of the

00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:24,180
trees but to get the bumpy appearance

00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,819
ride was quite tricky to do as you can

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,849
see in this image and in

00:37:25,819 --> 00:37:31,609
next one the green is really yeah just

00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:33,949
one big area of green and and it doesn't

00:37:31,609 --> 00:37:36,319
look like the bumpy appearance I was

00:37:33,949 --> 00:37:37,849
looking at and so I've tried all kinds

00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:40,219
of different things different colors

00:37:37,849 --> 00:37:43,489
different types of representing the bars

00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:46,759
but all didn't produce the right result

00:37:43,489 --> 00:37:48,949
you still see the one big area of green

00:37:46,759 --> 00:37:51,859
and not the bumpiness and then finally I

00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:55,640
figured out what did work so in the end

00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:57,410
every bar is has a gradient it starts

00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,839
out with the color of the globe so kind

00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:04,130
of bluish and then ends up with the

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,469
green color that I assigned to to the

00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:07,880
bar and this way they have different

00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:10,039
heights and then you have different

00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:12,259
colors on different heights because of

00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:17,499
the gradient and this way you do see the

00:38:12,259 --> 00:38:17,499
bumpy image and it works really well and

00:38:17,739 --> 00:38:22,869
it also ended up on the cover of the

00:38:20,449 --> 00:38:24,979
magazine which is really nice of course

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:27,380
now the reason why I'm showing this

00:38:24,979 --> 00:38:31,219
project is because what I've done here

00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:33,799
is I've been using metaphors and in this

00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:36,440
case the project was about trees so I

00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:38,089
thought what what are some

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,670
characteristics of trees that I could

00:38:38,089 --> 00:38:43,279
use well obviously it's green the

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:46,039
bumpiness and there is something in

00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:48,039
general which you could think of when

00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:50,299
you create a visualization think of the

00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:52,039
actual characteristics of the data that

00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:53,390
you're visualizing what what's the

00:38:52,039 --> 00:38:55,670
meaning can I use some of those

00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:58,039
properties in my design and I have some

00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:59,930
examples of other people's work where

00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,479
this is done as well this for instance

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,549
is a visualization done by the South

00:39:02,479 --> 00:39:07,549
China Morning Post and it's about the

00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:09,949
deaths in Iraq and basically it's just a

00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:14,119
bar chart but since they flipped the

00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:17,329
y-axis and made the bars red it clearly

00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,190
has the appearance of blood so they this

00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:21,979
is a good example of using a metaphor

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,859
and and and thinking about what does the

00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:26,599
data represent and what does it mean

00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:28,369
here's another one this is a wind

00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:31,190
visualization it's an animation if you

00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:33,089
go online by Martin Wattenberg and

00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:36,240
Fernanda Viegas

00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:39,440
well the common weather maps usually

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:41,339
have arrows but this one is actually

00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,220
especially if you go on tutoring online

00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:46,560
first and you see flows of lines going

00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:51,119
and they become narrower and wider and

00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:55,800
and that's much more and the way we

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,089
experience wind than an arrow so the

00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,900
final project I would like to show you

00:39:57,089 --> 00:40:03,990
is this for visualization I strongly

00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,290
believe I think just as with writing

00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:09,839
code in general you only get very good

00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:11,810
at it if you practice you can read a lot

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,609
about it but if you don't do the actual

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:17,579
coding or creating visualizations in

00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:18,480
this case you don't it's hard to become

00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:21,750
really good at it

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,250
so I I really like doing personal

00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:25,710
projects as well and this is one of

00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:31,410
those projects and this is about Dutch

00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:33,450
national elections of 2012 and when the

00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,700
elections were over people had a few

00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:37,410
questions which party is one which part

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,750
is lost what are possible coalition's

00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,460
which are which is always the case in

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,950
the Netherlands how is my city folded

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,270
and these are all very good questions of

00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,819
course because that's what the elections

00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:52,170
are about but you can also ask different

00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:54,150
kinds of questions the question I

00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:57,119
personally had was which cities vote in

00:40:54,150 --> 00:41:01,680
a similar way is my city and maybe are

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,780
there some patterns in the data well the

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,450
concept is more or less something like

00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,940
this so if you take these voting results

00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:10,440
you just overlay them and then you look

00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:12,300
at the differences and you sum them up

00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,430
and you can imagine if it's zero then

00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,680
they are exactly the same if it's not

00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,470
and they have some difference more or

00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:21,030
less like this now this is the

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:23,520
visualization that I created you see a

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,930
map of the Netherlands I actually didn't

00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,790
draw a map because the Netherlands is

00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:29,099
really densely populated so you can see

00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:31,530
the shape of the Netherlands just with

00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:33,060
the cities and you can offer over your

00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,349
you can click on cities and when you

00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,329
click on it they become bigger and more

00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,400
orange and other cities also become

00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:42,030
bigger and more orange if they are more

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,579
similar based on their voting results on

00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:46,029
the top left corner you see bar charts

00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:48,279
with the voting results of

00:41:46,029 --> 00:41:50,679
city that you selected and this is

00:41:48,279 --> 00:41:52,749
another layout where you a radio layout

00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,149
where the selected city is in the center

00:41:52,749 --> 00:41:58,049
of the of the screen and the more

00:41:55,149 --> 00:42:00,309
similar the following results are the

00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:04,809
closer to the center the other cities

00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:08,439
are I also included another data set

00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:10,089
about population size because I thought

00:42:08,439 --> 00:42:13,419
maybe there is a correlation between

00:42:10,089 --> 00:42:16,719
bigger cities in smaller cities so

00:42:13,419 --> 00:42:18,849
that's what I also included and it

00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:22,869
turned out there were actually some

00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:24,459
interesting findings the first one is is

00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:26,979
something like this which you can find

00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:29,529
in several places of this map and it's

00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:31,479
these are regional clusters so this is

00:42:29,529 --> 00:42:33,369
around the city of ain't over which is a

00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:35,439
relatively large city and funnily enough

00:42:33,369 --> 00:42:37,059
ain't openness itself is not in this

00:42:35,439 --> 00:42:39,669
cluster so it's really the cities around

00:42:37,059 --> 00:42:42,729
ain't over that vote in a similar way

00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:44,799
but also a little bit different than the

00:42:42,729 --> 00:42:46,929
rest of the Netherlands but I think this

00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:48,219
is quite interesting and and also if you

00:42:46,929 --> 00:42:49,989
would extend this project with these

00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:52,149
kind of clusters remain the same over

00:42:49,989 --> 00:42:55,809
time it will be quite interesting to

00:42:52,149 --> 00:42:57,399
research another thing is in the

00:42:55,809 --> 00:42:59,139
Netherlands we have a Bible Belt so if I

00:42:57,399 --> 00:43:00,909
select one city of the Bible Belt you

00:42:59,139 --> 00:43:05,589
clearly see that they all fold in a

00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:08,229
similar kind of way here I've selected

00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:10,509
Boston area which is a city associated

00:43:08,229 --> 00:43:13,419
with richer people and then the other

00:43:10,509 --> 00:43:15,759
ones are also cities of where people

00:43:13,419 --> 00:43:19,859
think rich people live so that's also

00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:23,879
something that you can see in the data

00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:26,949
in this view I've selected Amsterdam and

00:43:23,879 --> 00:43:28,779
although the relationship is not that

00:43:26,949 --> 00:43:30,459
strong you do see that the bigger cities

00:43:28,779 --> 00:43:33,429
are more on the inside and on the

00:43:30,459 --> 00:43:36,189
outside so bigger cities also a little

00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:38,769
bit in a similar way and as with many

00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:42,969
data sets there's also there are also

00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:46,799
outliers and this is Erick and there

00:43:42,969 --> 00:43:46,799
there's no city that feels like you're

00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:55,210
so now I've received emails that people

00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:58,340
were using this on for half an hour

00:43:55,210 --> 00:44:01,580
during work time just playing with this

00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:04,100
visualization and I thought why were

00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,840
they doing this because well and I I

00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:08,270
recently discovered this book it's

00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,220
called the hook model how to build

00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:13,070
habit-forming products and it's is

00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,870
basically about what you do when you

00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:17,390
want to create something like Facebook

00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:18,530
so that people keep using it and inside

00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,420
this book they have this model and I

00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,280
think this model also applies to the

00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,110
visualization because first you need to

00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,090
have a trigger and if you move over with

00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:28,190
your mouse over the visualization you

00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:29,870
see that it turns into a hand so you are

00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,000
triggered that you can click on it and

00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:34,250
then clicking on it is the actual action

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,890
but what's key here I think is the

00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:39,500
variable reward so sometimes you see

00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:42,050
something sometimes you don't and you

00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:46,040
also have to do some effort for it so I

00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:48,920
think that's one of the main reasons why

00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:51,670
people were really playing with this

00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,110
visualization for quite some time

00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:55,700
because yeah sometimes you can really

00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:58,970
find something and sometimes you don't

00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,950
and also something like the Bible Belt

00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:03,410
that I discovered the visualization

00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,840
itself doesn't tell you there is a Bible

00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:08,090
Belt in the visualization I just thought

00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:09,890
of the thought of it myself and then I

00:45:08,090 --> 00:45:12,140
confirmed it with the visualization but

00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:14,300
you can do that yourself as well so you

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:15,980
can think of well maybe I know where

00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:18,140
farmers live or something like that and

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,950
see if there's a pet on there so you can

00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,900
find things yourself and I think that's

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,970
something that if you can apply that to

00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:30,690
your visualization that's something

00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:41,680
that's really useful thank you very much

00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:43,900
[Applause]

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:46,390
thank you very much for this inspiring

00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,099
talk I think the image of thousands of

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:51,759
people the counting trees all over the

00:45:48,099 --> 00:45:55,470
world will stay for a while and also

00:45:51,759 --> 00:45:59,339
amazing how you can get from like one

00:45:55,470 --> 00:46:02,249
white and like picture to a

00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:05,140
representation which contains much more

00:46:02,249 --> 00:46:14,730
detail so we have maybe time for just

00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:14,730
one quick question yeah here

00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:28,219
so how do you use of the shelf tools and

00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:31,519
libraries or do you build stuff yourself

00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:34,519
to do these kinds of visualizations it's

00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:38,390
all custom visualizations the only thing

00:46:34,519 --> 00:46:43,819
that I do use is some frameworks so one

00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:47,269
of the most popular ones is d3 but for

00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:50,209
the European Space Agency for instance I

00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:52,430
used three Jas so I use libraries like

00:46:50,209 --> 00:47:02,930
that but other than that it's it's all

00:46:52,430 --> 00:47:07,640
custom one another quick question here

00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:09,049
just close to the microphone so similar

00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,089
question but if you deploy these

00:47:09,049 --> 00:47:14,689
projects what's your typical technology

00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:15,019
stack the typical technologies that I

00:47:14,689 --> 00:47:18,049
use

00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:22,099
yes I would say that today most of my

00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:24,769
visualizations are web-based and for the

00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:27,410
data preparation and wrangling and

00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:31,130
everything on that I use Python and

00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:32,779
those are basically the two old order

00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:34,819
programming languages that I use I

00:47:32,779 --> 00:47:39,529
sometimes use tableau which is a

00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:41,269
business intelligence tool but it allows

00:47:39,529 --> 00:47:43,249
you to quickly get a sense of data

00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:45,559
because it can just open in Excel our

00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:47,959
CSV file and drag and drop and you it

00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,539
already crazy diagrams sometimes I use

00:47:47,959 --> 00:47:53,029
that but mostly today I most what time

00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:58,519
you spice and for that so mostly Python

00:47:53,029 --> 00:48:00,170
and web-based frameworks whatever okay

00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:02,119
so thank you very much now there's a

00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:03,569
coffee break let's thank young William

00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,630
again
