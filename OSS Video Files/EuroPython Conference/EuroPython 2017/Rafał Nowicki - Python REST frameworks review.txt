Number of libraries for building RESTful web applications is growing up. Selecting best framework becomes hard decision for web developers.

During the presentation I will go through best libraries I can recommend for building RESTful web applications.

Selection of libraries will be subjective, based on my experience with building microservices in Python. I will share code examples, weaknesses and strengths for each library. I hope everyone will find something that best suits his needs.
