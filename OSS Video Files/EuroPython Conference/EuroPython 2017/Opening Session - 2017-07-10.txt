	00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:09,270
hello everyone how are you

00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:27,140
welcome to Remini so let's start first

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,540
of all I'd like to I'd like to welcome

00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,369
all the new European Isis I know that we

00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,900
have a lot of regulars coming back to

00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:35,149
Europe eyes in every single year which

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:38,329
is great as well of course but of course

00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:45,260
we we always like to have new people

00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:49,789
come to the community and I'm sorry it's

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:51,710
not working okay so we always like to

00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,679
welcome new people to the community and

00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:56,420
I I think it's it's very nice that we

00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,359
always get new people to the conference

00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:02,480
I also like to welcome the sponsors

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,309
because without the sponsors you'd be

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,130
paying at least 200 years more per

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:17,540
ticket so I think they deserve a good

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:21,200
hand from you so who's behind all this

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,899
it's a small team of volunteers we are

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,619
about 10 people who are really working

00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:29,479
hard to make this happen and of those 10

00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:36,110
people we have two people here up on the

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:38,570

00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:56,390

must say that we had quite a few changes

00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:09,419

cannot have the same account you will

00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:04,180
find the maps the programs as I said and

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:05,680
also a lot of useful information so

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,750
yesterday we already have two beginners

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,250
workshop which was very very popular and

00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:14,110
the the mentors there they they want to

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,030
basically share this idea of helping

00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,980
other people and make it possible for

00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:19,870
all the attendees to basically say okay

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,630
I can help others who may have a

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,030
question so what they did is they create

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,530
these stickers as you can see here you

00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,050
can get those stickers dancers at the

00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:30,780
conference death and if you wear the

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,880
stick it basically says that you're open

00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,440
to accept any questions from anyone and

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,820
then if you want help from someone you

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,620
can just approach these people and just

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,040
ask them questions so I think it's a

00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,040
very nice idea

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:48,000
volunteers yellow t-shirt so yeah we are

00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:50,400
here to help you can find volunteers

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,910
inside the rooms close to the

00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:57,450
registration desk and please we need

00:10:53,910 --> 00:11:01,980
help for a lot of stuff so join the

00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:03,450
volunteers and with this slide I also

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,040
like to thank all the volunteers that

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:07,500
have helped yesterday set up the

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,900
conference we had quite a few people and

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,520
it was really pretty nice to see that

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,460
people were open to help and I think

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:23,110
they need a big big hand from here

00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:26,320
[Applause]

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,850
right then we we have a code of conduct

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,600
essentially it's nice to each other and

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:34,220
be professional and please don't spam

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,720

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,850
the conference including all the social

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,040
channels so all the communication I have

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:42,530

I'm sorry if you have the new MacBook

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:49,000
probably it will not work we will try to

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,180
add no resolve this problem we also have

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,950
some new adapters for this but at least

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:58,900
for now we are not very lucky so make

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,720
sure to be there at least 10 minutes

00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,400
before the beginning of your session and

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,050
after the talk remember to leave the

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:12,300
adapters there and also please if you

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:12,300
can upload your slides on the website

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:18,010
all right we're almost done there's one

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,840
more thing that we have to say that it's

00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,450
not allowed to have food or drinks in

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,430
the session rooms except your bottles

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,110
you so you can take your bottles into

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:29,290
the rooms and then have like to drink

00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,850
water we'd appreciate if you follow this

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:33,220
because it just keeps the rooms clean

00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:36,370
and we don't have that much issues with

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:38,710
the venue then so there's nothing much

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:39,760
left to say just except maybe enjoy the

00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:46,899
conference

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,899
