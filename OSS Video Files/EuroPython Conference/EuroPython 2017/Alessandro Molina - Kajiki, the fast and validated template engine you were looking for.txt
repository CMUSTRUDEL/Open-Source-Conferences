	"Kajiki, the fast and validated template engine you were looking for
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PyCharm Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Being dissatisfied with some of the constraints and complex usage of Genshi, the TurboGears2 team started working on an alternative that could solve Genshi speed issues, complex inheritance system and be backward compatible with genshi templates. This is a talk about what lead to the creation of the Kajiki template engine and what's particular about it. 

The talk will cover: 
- Comparison on the major template engines available in python to showcase what's special in Kajiki (validated, xml based) what was special in Genshi (also lazy evaluated)
- What's a validated template engine and why it's good to have one.
- How Kajiki works, showcase kajiki syntax, it's performances and how to use it in any python project.
- Why Kajiki is fast, code generation applied and how to write a code generation template engine like Kajiki and Jinja2 (showcase a simple 50 lines of code template engine that uses code generation).
