	"From Fun to Business - How Open Source Changed my Life
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-10 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Coala (https://coala.io/) began as a fun project. We never believed there would be anything useful growing out of it - and yet it did. Contributors all over the world came to us and helped creating the community as it is.

But how did all of this happen? What does this mean for the main contributors? How can we make a living of an open source project?

This talk tells our story. What we did - good and bad things - so we can learn from it. From my personal open source contributions over founding an open source project to building a freelance agency and founding a startup.

Participants will learn how they can grow an open source project, automate newcomer processes and gain insights into how they can start making a living of it, possibly founding a company eventually. There is no single recipe for this but we can - and should - exchange the tips and tricks weâ€™ve gained with our ventures. This talk is for entrepreneurs, wanna-be-freelancers and future or past open source project founders.

This talk is completely new and has not been presented at any conference yet although it overlaps with previous talks of mine which have received much positive feedback at previous regional PyCons. It will be tested at a local meetup to ensure proper timing.

	00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:18,270
thank you okay let's get started

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:22,260
so this talk named from fun to business

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,480
is about maybe like three main things

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:30,240
the first one is the most important

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:33,780
thing fun have more fun please

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:38,489
this is like my major call to action I

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,559
want you to have more fun and it's also

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:43,140
a bit about open source it's a bit about

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,640
how we grew the koala open source

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,730
project and then in the end we will be

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,500
talking about like even what what do you

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,030
do if your open source project takes

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,809
over your life and you're like thirty

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:01,140
hours a week in your free time maybe you

00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:05,220
can try making business with that while

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:10,820
keeping the stuff that makes fun so fun

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:15,780
is really essential that actually means

00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:18,990
or can mean in my case sometimes making

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,180
less money can help you making more

00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,960
money per hour like just like do only

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,869
stuff that is fun and if you have like

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,920
not enough time and people are willing

00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,600
to buy the time it's a normal freelancer

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,649
you can just charge more per hour for

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,220
example so we will be talking about

00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:46,110
those kind of stuff as well as then

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,479
being an entrepreneur so the red line

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,840
through this is basically just my

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,210
personal story because I basically

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,280
started out as a student in university

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:01,680
and I was bored so when you're bored

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,509
there's basically nothing better you can

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,160
do with your time than writing operating

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,740
system right so that's what I did and

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,720
that was called yo foas yet another free

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,940
operating system and that was like a I

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,129
was a kernel it even had like multi

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,439
processing in the end

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:24,590
and it was printing ace and bees and

00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,409
parallel on the screen and I was very

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:29,359
very XS excitedly showing that to my

00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:35,019
girlfriend and she was looking at me

00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:37,819
like a sheep but you know it was fun and

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:40,969
I learned a lot about it and I never

00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,889
regretted doing this kind of project but

00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:44,689
what went from this project eventually

00:02:42,889 --> 00:02:46,669
we had lots of code and it was lots of

00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:48,290
shitty code and I hate afraid I was like

00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:50,150
hey do you want to join this this is

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,989
really fun writing operating system

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:59,780
kernel and see he was like no way I'm

00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:02,060
going to try something new Python and I

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:05,599
was like very skeptical a language that

00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:09,799
uses indentation but he did his stuff

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,230
and then he wrote he wrote basically the

00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,439
first version of koala back then which

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,569
was a coat checker that actually already

00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,400
dynamically loaded Python routines that

00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:24,349
would check my source code because it

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:27,590
was all so ugly and badly readable to go

00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:29,959
to be a bit little sidetracked from that

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:32,329
sorry what happened then was my

00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:36,470
introduction to open source and that was

00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:37,849
a google Summer of Code short ji-suk for

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,150
those who don't know google Summer of

00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:41,629
Code

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:43,430
who knows google Summer of Code great

00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:48,139
who raises his hand when they ask him to

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:52,840
raise his hand like everyone raise his

00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:56,389
hand ok that didn't work interesting and

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,729
google Summer of Code for those few who

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,159
didn't raise their hand is a program of

00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:03,109
Google and they set out scholarships for

00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,629
feet for students to work on open-source

00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:08,079
projects over the summer the motto is

00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:11,269
basically flip bits instead of burgers

00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:14,629
it works pretty well and I had a google

00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,370
Summer of Code at genome so I was

00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:20,419
working with gnome and I was learning a

00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:24,320
lot especially about kids kids and kids

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:28,550
commit messages and more about gifts so

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,919
that really shaped the way I'm nowadays

00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,660
working and thinking and it was the

00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:35,030
first time I worked on real

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:38,750
life project and that and that was way

00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,910
beyond university stuff because much of

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,370
that like especially like how you work

00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:46,010
together in a team is never being taught

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,990
properly in universities and all that

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,920
people know outside universities seems

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:54,530
to be the get flow which half of the

00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,930
people think they use but don't use and

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,470
the other half of the people may be used

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:02,810
I don't know

00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:04,780
but due to this google Summer of Code I

00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:08,120
got involved in open source and

00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,460
eventually we made koala like a proper

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,800
open source project and we renamed it

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:15,770
and we rewrote it and out of sudden

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,680
people became interested and this was

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:21,860
really unexpected the sole project was

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,480
just done so we can have our fun you see

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:28,580
a pattern here right so eventually

00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,830
people got interesting interested and

00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:36,710
helped us doing this because a lot of

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,890
people are asking also last time after

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:41,510
the talk like what is koala anyway I

00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,730
will be like very very quick to the

00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:45,290
attention of what koalas koala I

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,120
mentioned this earlier it analyzes

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:49,250
source code it finds problems in the

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,169
source code and it also can fix some of

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,270
them so it can give you patches it's

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,250
like a linter but it's a linter

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,400
framework so if we look at the world of

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,740
linters we have lots of different tools

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,630
like really lots and lots and lots of

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:06,020
tools and we have lots of ways to use

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,060
those tools and it's basically like

00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,919
rewriting library office just a spell

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,320
checking for another language which is

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
kind of stupid but that's how the world

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,640
currently looks like

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,830
so koala is a framework that allows you

00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,290
to write code analysis and it gives you

00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:24,200
the whole user interface for free so you

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,290
just write the logic and what we also

00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:29,660
did was we wrapped the existing tools so

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,760
koalas one central API I can take all

00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,160
tools wrap them to it and then again you

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:39,169
can use all those tools in sublime if I

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,270
want to or maybe directly in get up so

00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:44,300
currently the code analysis provided is

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,250
for more than 60 languages and if you

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:48,620
want to know more you can come to us

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,840
which we have in the hall where also

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:57,380
some food is at some point we had a

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,510
problem a very comfortable problem to

00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:03,140
say so so this is the graph of the

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:05,720
github stars but the contributions like

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:08,930
the number of contributors behaved

00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,390
similarly and with programs like Google

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:14,210
Summer of Code and with hackathons we

00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:15,290
had lots and lots of people joining the

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,210
project

00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:22,070
lots of people also only for a short

00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:25,390
amount of time but some not and we had a

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:28,880
community that was steadily growing and

00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:31,460
we really had a problem of we have those

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,140
great main trainers who are all helping

00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:38,320
us and they are all busy inviting

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,400
newcomers assigning them to issues

00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:42,230
github permission system is totally

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,080
broken in case you don't know like you

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,880
can't give somebody access to take an

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,450
issue without giving a full write access

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,530
or everything also you don't want to

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,210
have all your maintenance have

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,610
administration access being able to

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:58,070
change everything like inclusion

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,600
including branch protections I wish even

00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:08,260
I couldn't change that so with that we

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:11,690
have the need for automation and also we

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,729
investigated like what makes people come

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,120
to open-source projects and what makes

00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:19,160
it easier for them to get started

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,320
so as for the last thing I basically

00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,690
took like what I learned from Gloam and

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,830
what I think that so to say went wrong

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:30,140
or that could have been better and a few

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,360
of I'm now presenting like a few things

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:34,310
a few tips and tricks if you want to if

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,940
you want to make an open-source project

00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:40,250
if you want to get contributors and it

00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:42,440
basically goes down to make contribution

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:46,670
easy and make contribution also

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,160
rewarding if you can because in the

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,320
beginning as a newcomer you have two

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,420
problems you need to fix an issue in a

00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,940
code base that you don't know and it's

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:58,160
at the same time you also need to learn

00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,610
a new workflow and that is the git

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,140
workflow

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,910
usually the

00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,910
close and open source projects are like

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,070
more complicated than what people know

00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:10,820
from their company or from the

00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:13,610
University especially if you have like a

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,380
proper workflow meaning no merges and

00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,370
fast forwards because you want to have

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:22,430
your passing CIOs or passing on master

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:26,209
so you can for example introduce issue

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,519
levels and that is a very simple tool

00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:30,970
it basically says like whenever you see

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,560
a typo in your documentation or anywhere

00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:36,079
something that is really really simple

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,140
to fix something that you can you can

00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:41,930
grab any person on the world

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,029
tell it to can speak a little bit of

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,490
English tell that person's fix it and

00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:49,970
that person can fix that issue that's a

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,490
newcomer issue and the newcomer issue is

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,180
critical so people can learn the get

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,339
workflow

00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,750
people can learn the guidry based people

00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:59,180
can learn how they can make pull

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,620
requests and if they can do all that

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,779
matter it's fine then they're done with

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,720
this in five minutes and if not then

00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,519
they learn this and usually like I think

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,529
almost every contributor and that

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,449
includes experienced people because

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:16,670
workflows are special every contributor

00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:19,279
learn something the next thing is that

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:22,130
you also have the problem like you have

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,490
few maintenance and you have lots of

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:28,730
newcomers at the same time like those

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,410
newcomers you want them to be part of

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:34,190
your community and you want them to grow

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:36,800
up you don't want them to feel like I'm

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,459
just a contributor and there's those

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,470
holy mighty maintained errs so what you

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:44,329
can actually do is like let them review

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:45,500
code of the maintainer and the

00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:50,540
maintainer is review code of the

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,730
newcomers because the maintenance are

00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,940
maybe more experienced but the newcomers

00:10:52,730 --> 00:11:00,920
are also providing fresh sites a fresh

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:02,870
view on the code and they they are a

00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,760
good complement to each other and at the

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,709
same time newcomers feel respected and

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,060
their opinions are taken into account

00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:13,760
and then they also grow up faster and

00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:15,860
they can become a maintainer eventually

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,360
and this this whole border of Maine

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,270
terror and newcomer is just like a

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,270
permission thing there's nothing more

00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,040
yeah so those quotes I sometimes have

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,380
quotes here those are things like when I

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,440
asked the Quahog community about like

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:38,510
what do you like or not like about our

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:41,480
newcomer process we I don't think we had

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:43,760
any negative comments on stuff that we

00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,430
did except that reviews are not fast

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:55,220
enough there's a problem for us at the

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:57,590
moment so the next thing is same a bit

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:01,070
in the lines of before we can learn from

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:03,470
newcomers like we the holy mighty Maine

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,050
generous we can learn from the new

00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,610
people especially when it comes for

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:11,270
example to the newcomer workflow like

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,100
how did this go for you did you have any

00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,650
problems where are your problems it's

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,960
like you can usability test your new

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:20,420
chroma workflow and then you can make it

00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,090
very easy to contribute and then you can

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:25,670
get more contributions it's basically as

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,980
simple as that so you have to iterate

00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:31,820
and you have to think like a start-up

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:35,110
and that is a decision that you really

00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:38,060
have to make because you can't really

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,190
progress like super fast with a maximum

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,110
of power that would be like having all

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,410
maintained is working on all important

00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:47,990
features and instead you can decide you

00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:50,270
don't have to to grow your community and

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,280
that will cost time it will cost a lot

00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:54,440
of time for the maintenance and everyone

00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:56,120
but you will you will grow as a

00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,530
community and you will have to think

00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,750
like a start-up because a start-up

00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,480
usually doesn't think about like revenue

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:06,020
or short-term goals they want to grow as

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,210
fast as possible and so I think this

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,620
comparison is like really an interesting

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:11,660
thing and that is something that an

00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:19,310
open-source project has to decide what

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:22,220
is my priority so eventually this became

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:25,370
the full-time free time occupation as I

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,960
hinted earlier and now we are getting a

00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,960
bit into the automation

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:38,180
so we started writing a tool that

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,060
reviewed the poor requests of our people

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:46,280
automatically using koala we already had

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:50,270
the code analysis tool so why not use it

00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,610
why not have the newcomers automatically

00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:55,880
being told hey your commit message is

00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,500
not an import of tennis or you have a

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,050
trailing period in your commit message

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,390
those are like the most common issues

00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:04,670
for newcomers are they have to learn the

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:08,240
commit message guidelines or also the

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:12,490
code staff and this way newcomers get an

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,490
instant feedback on github for the code

00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:21,170
yeah I don't have a demo for this right

00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,030
now but it's basically just a bot that

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:27,530
automatically comments right in the

00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:29,840
github div and you can go further you

00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,820
can automatically label issues if the

00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:33,620
issue label is in the issue text so

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:36,070
people who don't have access to labeling

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:39,740
issues can just mention them in the body

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:42,200
you can build a chat bot to assign

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,940
people to issues so they can self assign

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,650
them without having right access to the

00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:48,410
github repository I will do the

00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,730
lightening talk about the chat bot right

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,950
after the stock in the lightening talk

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:56,930
session and the next steps for us are we

00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,810
definitely want to look into finding

00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,820
duplicate issues for example and because

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,250
the issue base grows and this is all

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:10,310
stuff that sucks up maintainer time and

00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:12,650
that you can automate so thinking about

00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:15,350
how can we turn this into business we

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,000
have this I'm working on this this is

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,610
all great it's totally fun

00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,650
but it's not really sustainable forever

00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:27,589
an open-source community can only grow

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:30,350
so far with love and error right so I

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:34,339
personally start to go freelance at some

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:37,550
time a problem with freelancing is its

00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:39,440
kind of hope business as the founder of

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:41,340
an open-source project you usually have

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,030
something that you can show to people

00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:47,340
and that definitely works it's usually

00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:50,930
being perceived as a very impressive

00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:54,630
thing although like it's just luck right

00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:57,120
plus a bit of like iterate and take

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,420
feedback seriously but it's nothing

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,680
really special

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:07,620
so what I try to do with my freelance

00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:12,390
business is I basically try to make a

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:15,150
sustainable business model and then I

00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,460
tried building this website and this

00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,810
totally failed so I'm not sharing an

00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:21,960
advertisement here right this is a

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,610
failed product because I think it's also

00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,280
important to show things that do not

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,590
work this was for example like hey we're

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,540
good with open source we can grow open

00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:34,340
source communities and we have shown

00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:39,390
success here we can show off stuff and

00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:43,580
let's just try to build packages that

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,580
companies would pay on a monthly basis

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:52,140
that to help companies building open

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:55,530
source projects and like we didn't fully

00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:59,100
check that business model like to the

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:02,010
book with some Lean Startup methods but

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:05,430
I did talk to a few people here and

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:08,959
there and we have the website up and

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:15,870
there was no interest at all in this

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:19,530
like nothing so we screw this and I

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:22,590
found a new project a new product which

00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:25,530
is working on MVPs for startups which

00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:29,070
seems to go better I think one lesson

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:30,990
here is if things are screwed up just

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,840
throw them away like that's okay and

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,100
then maybe you waste a bit of time but

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,500
there's no reason to waste more time

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:42,990
right so apart from this freelance

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,230
business we were like how can we make a

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:48,720
business that Suites more than one

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:51,540
person it's again like how can we make a

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,370
product also especially a product that

00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,140
is related to koala

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,000
and that is basically what we trade with

00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,810
get make or what we are currently trying

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,270
with get mate and we're a start-up it's

00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:04,950
completely chaotic we have no idea where

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,500
we're going

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:12,780
I think it's good that way it's very fun

00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:14,250
it's exciting actually I can show it

00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,050
like this was the automation that I

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,010
talked about earlier so every pull

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:24,480
request would get a pull request state

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:26,790
and you can you can have comments right

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,410
in the diff that basically show you how

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:35,400
to build better source code and we're

00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:37,440
not fully sure how we are going to make

00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,170
a working business out of this

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,100
we got some government funding we have a

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:49,350
first client that pays us for get lab

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:52,380
support for this basically but it is

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:55,680
possible to go out with open source

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,540
products to build solutions that are

00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,460
free or at least largely free we are

00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:04,560
still considering the open core model

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:07,800
which is what github also does but it is

00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,990
possible to do that and I'm saying you

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:17,490
can do that and I can do that

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:20,730
like you just have to just do it and the

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,810
main lesson is again have fun in

00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:28,290
whatever you're doing

00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:31,200
and don't be afraid of I need a hundred

00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:33,570
bucks more on my bank account if you

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,290
don't really need it I don't know there

00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:40,350
may be cases where it really matters but

00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:42,870
in my case like it does not really

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:47,910
matter I can pay my rent it's not a lot

00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:50,190
but it works and I can have fun doing

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:52,170
what I want and I think that's more

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:56,400
important than having way more money

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:59,640
that I would need or can eat and that's

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,260
basically the main message and with that

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,390
I'm opening up the round for questions

00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,380
with the hint if you want to speak more

00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,140
like if there's any

00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:14,040
that we can't talk about we have a koala

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:23,280
questions okay

00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:27,480
Oh is there anything that anyone would

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,600
like to know I don't want to babble all

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,610
day long with nobody actually wanting to

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:38,420
hear more information and we can just

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:41,040
close this and if you have questions yes

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:48,390
you just just take some time for the

00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:51,690
first question to come hello my name is

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:54,030
Harry and I have the same issue that

00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:58,340
describe you 52 have not been allowed to

00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:01,950
give other users to tag the issues or

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:05,190
assigned choose people to fix did you

00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:10,070
try any other workflow instead of like

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,070
having a bot to try to do that work

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:16,650
sorry you're you're asking about the

00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:20,640
promotion problem yes and if we tried

00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:23,059
any existing BOTS or solutions to that

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,309
I don't know just wondering because I

00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:28,410
think it's a big issue for any community

00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:30,660
that you are trying to build to like not

00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:32,670
being blockage just because someone

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,920
decide no this is a feature that you're

00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:40,230
not going to implement like giving

00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:42,980
permission for random people so do you

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,100
know the s flag for UNIX executables

00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,960
sorry

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,950
do you know the S flag for UNIX

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:52,080
executables so basically it says like

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,540
this application has administration

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,690
rights even if a non administrator runs

00:22:54,540 --> 00:23:00,480
it right is used for for example + + WD

00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,690
like for changing your password you need

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,980
access to normally read-only file so you

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:08,309
have applications that have root access

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,559
that otherwise don't have root access we

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:18,780
basically get the same with github by

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:22,610
having a bot I can show you so we have a

00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:27,870
chat bot and when new comers come and

00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:30,870
the page loads they have to wait until

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,460
the page is loaded and after that they

00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:35,549
basically just like write hello world

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,370
into the chat and then we have a bot the

00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:44,400
bot has a github account that has full

00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:47,340
administration rights ok so much for

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,590
that the bot has a github account that

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,299
has full administration rights so I

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,299
think I have it open

00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:07,960
here so when you write hello world the

00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,869
bots can just invite you to the

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,580
organization and tell you like here take

00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:14,559
care of that take care of that we have

00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:18,129
documentation about newcomers guide and

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:20,769
everything and then you can just do

00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:21,190
quotable assign me assignment to that

00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:24,190
issue

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,840
give me that issue and all those

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:28,509
newcomers don't have access to the

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,340
repository but through that but like

00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:33,039
this executable which can perform

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,679
actions for you but only selected

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:37,480
actions the bots can assign people and

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,779
then you don't have this permission

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,409
problem anymore and that's this is open

00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:54,100
source at github comm slash koala slash

00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:55,649
quotable this one I will present it

00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:02,919
later in the lightning talks

00:24:55,649 --> 00:25:07,570
does this answer your question great and

00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:09,970
we can take okay I think verily they're

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:13,539
waiting for your lighting talk there

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,770
will happen soon so thank you so much

00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,730
