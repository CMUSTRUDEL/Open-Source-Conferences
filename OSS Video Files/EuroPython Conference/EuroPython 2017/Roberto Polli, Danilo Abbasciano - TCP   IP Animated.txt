	"TCP / IP Animated
[EuroPython 2017 - Interactive session - 2017-07-10 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

This interactive game teaches is the follow-up of the Router Game by Roberto Polli, and teaches various TCP / IP protocols using paper and pen.

Participants are divided in teams, simulating exchanges through various protocols (DNS, TCP, IP)

Every player has an L3 role: a PC or mobile phone, a Router, a Load Balancer ... and must communicate with the others following the associate specification (eg. a TCP client may buffer frames, a Load Balancer re-encapsulates IP datagram, ... )

The team which is faster in exhanging messages wins.
