Serverless computing has been a popular topic the past couple years, and with respect to Python, there have been various different frameworks and tools released for developing and managing your Python serverless applications. This talk will focus on developing and managing your serverless applications with chalice (https://github.com/awslabs/chalice), a python serverless microframework for AWS. Discussion points for this talk will include, but not be limited to:
