	"Using the right Async tool, present day
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - Arengo]
[Rimini, Italy]

Recent releases like AsyncIO and Django Channels gave a new push towards building real-time web-apps fast and easy. However, as similar tools exist in Python since 2000th, how should we balance between modern and time-proven?

This talk includes but is not focused just on AsyncIO. It gives an overview of Async libraries in Python, and helps with choosing a right tool for various web tasks.

It describes caveats of using Twisted, Tornado and AsyncIO including theory and live code, and concludes with a basic overview of Django Channels.
