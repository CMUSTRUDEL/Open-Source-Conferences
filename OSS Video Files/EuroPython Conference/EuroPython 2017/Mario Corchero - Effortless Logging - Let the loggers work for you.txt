Logs are your best friends on those late nights when you try to troubleshoot that problem in production that was written by a friend of you who is on holidays at the moment. Logs are the main way to know what is happening at runtime with an running application but as we donâ€™t realize how important they are until we actually need them it is usually an under appreciated part of our development process.

This talks overviews the logging module of the standard library and demonstrates some basic best practices and techniques make the most out of our logging when we need it.
After this talk you will be fully familiar not only on how to use the logging library but also how it is actually designed, how it works, how to extended further than the basic usage and some sample recipes and configurations for complex applications.
