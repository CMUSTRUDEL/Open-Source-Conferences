	"Inspiring all children, a journey: diversity and computing education
[EuroPython 2017 - Talk - 2017-07-11 - PythonAnywhere Room]
[Rimini, Italy]

Do you remember when you wrote your first line of code? Do you remember who inspired you  to become who you are when you were a child? But also, what the challenges might have been?
I remember when I was a little girl with a strong interest in a lot of things, including science, and what and who helped me pursue an education and a career in science and technology.
However, my journey in the industry from France to the UK, from software engineer student to team lead, from language processing to robots to online coding games, made me understand there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of diversity.
I will talk about my own experiences, what shaped my dreams and inspirations, the reality check, and the project I’m now working on Code For Life.
Code For Life is an initiative started at Ocado Technology in 2014, in response to the UK putting computing in the primary school curriculum. It comprises a small full time team and also a large group of dedicated volunteers who focus on creating free, open source games, mostly web games developed with Django, to teach all children how to program. We are all dedicated to inspire all children and give them the tools and opportunities they deserve.

I hope you're enjoying your the

00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:11,940
conference so far I know I am thank you

00:00:09,129 --> 00:00:11,940
for being here today

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:18,970
my name is Celine and the team lead for

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:21,760
code for life autocad oh but I wasn't

00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:27,910
always the same lead I was also a little

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:30,160
girl once a long time ago okay I was

00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,219
pretty geeky when I was a kid so most

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,590
kids love dinosaurs and I was one of

00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:38,470
them I really knew everything about them

00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,350
I love them it was amazing

00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:43,899
but I also love things like mazes and

00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,730
microscopes when I say I love mazes I

00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:48,070
don't just don't like to solve them I

00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:50,230
like to actually create some so I would

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,239
spend like summer break just drawing

00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:56,739
mazes and then like asking my parents

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,690
nicely to solve them into a sofa we

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,050
would fight for getting the microscope

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,869
at Christmas and things like that but

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:08,290
well I also like to play doll with one

00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:13,600
of my friends and she had this big

00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:15,790
dollhouse pretty pink right but my main

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,790
issue at that time was where other

00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:20,530
stairs where are the stairs or maybe the

00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,630
lifts all the boulders of the ladders or

00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,220
whatever where are they so my friend was

00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,080
like well I don't care I don't mind I

00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,850
just take the door with my hand and put

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,170
it myself on the second from second oh

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,070
it doesn't make sense you want me to

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:35,830
build you a lift and she was like no

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,939
okay so yeah I was a bit geeky fine we

00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:42,490
get it but it's nice to be like a bit

00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:45,100
geeky but if you really want to pursue a

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,140
career in science or technology at some

00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,960
point you also need mentors and I think

00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,570
I was really lucky to get some

00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,740
incredible mentors such as this primary

00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,090
school teacher that's an actual picture

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,000
from when I was nine so that's why it's

00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:02,950
broad

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,619
this guy was amazing so we actually were

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,960
in a destitute area in the north of

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:11,739
Paris in the northern suburbs of Paris

00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:15,069
and it was 1994 but still none of us had

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:17,409
ever seen a computer at this time and

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,860
this man make sure that we would get

00:02:17,409 --> 00:02:21,340
some

00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,950
what he did is that he just went I think

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,870
he just asked some companies there or

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,000
things like that but to to to bring you

00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:31,720
some secondhand computers so we could

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,280
actually see them and work with them and

00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,710
we were doing things like you know

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,900
drawing and writing poems and he said

00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:39,670
well what don't you just put it on like

00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,470
word or paint and they're not going to

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,710
print them out put them in the classroom

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,330
and at this time it was amazing for us

00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:47,700
he also told us a lot about like the

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:51,220
theory of evolution

00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,140
he brought us news so that we could take

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,260
yeah really cool so that we could take

00:02:53,140 --> 00:03:01,330
care of them I think this person was

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:03,340
like a great inspiration I didn't have

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,550
like so many friends and I'm an only

00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,440
child so I didn't have like any siblings

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,050
to also act as like older children

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,630
mentors but I had my cousins and I also

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,000
want to thank them obviously they would

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:19,209
just show me things like pac-man or

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,820
games and teach me more about how to

00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:26,410
unleash my creativity but also magical

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,720
tricks and they were really amazing but

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:32,920
mostly I was a bookworm I was always

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:36,640
reading something you might know that is

00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,290
Tintin it's a comic book this one is

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,880
destination moon and I think that's

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,080
where I learned my first concepts of

00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:47,950
like nuclear physics here it's like a

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,420
pretty dramatic view of the space rocket

00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:51,160
but there are some pages which are less

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,750
dramatic but I loved more when they

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,090
explained to us about nuclear physics

00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,640
and how they make the matters of the

00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:01,060
rocket and the Captain Haddock in Latvia

00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,070
what you said and I really loved it so I

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,290
say this point I guess I sort of wanted

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,530
to become a physicist but anyway I just

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,540
loved love that but if you really look

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,209
closely at this book and I would say I

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,120
ordered Tintin book in general there are

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,820
not a lot of women or people of color so

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:22,419
here the people working to build a

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:24,070
rocket are only whiteness now at this

00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,560
time I didn't mind so much because I

00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:29,770
knew there were some role models that I

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,930
could find but I don't know what would

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,270
have happened because

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,340
it's really good for kids to grow with

00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:38,800
role models that really help you

00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,960
understand that you can do something and

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,030
I think I knew I could be a physicist or

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:48,400
a scientist just because Marie Curie was

00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:50,020
like a model that I knew existed and my

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,800
mom told me a lot about her and I was

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:55,780
like watch this woman is amazing so I

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,820
think that real life is this is probably

00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,380
more important than comic book physics

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:04,270
but still yet I wanted to become like a

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,590
lot of different things when I was a kid

00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:11,139
so I really loved science but I also

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:14,110
wanted to become a writer I wanted to

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:16,210
become an actor too at some point I

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,740
guess I should have put finger to

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,020
because I wanted to be that when I was

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,190
four but that was probably the worst

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,750
idea of ten points I was ready also I

00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:27,460
was interested in makin an igloo

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:34,110
biologist I don't know if anyone of you

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:37,180
knows what an exobiologist is sort of

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:39,100
okay there are people that's - the alien

00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:42,340
life-forms of the possibility of alien

00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:45,240
life-forms and it sounded really close

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,099
like yeah I want to do that so badly

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:50,740
then I looked a bit into it and I

00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:52,690
discovered that basically they were

00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,210
looking for meteorites to arrive on

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,010
earth then we just analyze it

00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:59,440
check for organic matter they all know

00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,780
that this time bye see you next year and

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,289
what I mean maybe I don't know not that

00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:08,820
much I also love ancient Egypt I wanted

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:12,520
to become an addict ologist until I

00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:16,780
watched this documentary when there were

00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:19,150
some people that were trying to ask a

00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:22,389
peasant in Egypt to get rid of his field

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,880
so they could just search what was there

00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:29,080
and it was the only way for this person

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,780
and to just feed his family and I was

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,700
like yeah I think that real life people

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,870
are probably more important so that's

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:40,900
also when I stopped I think so I had a

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:44,550
hard time choosing the French equivalent

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:47,129
of a levels or GCSE

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:50,970
I really hesitate between science and

00:06:47,129 --> 00:06:55,560
literature a lot spoilers I chose

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:58,280
science so obviously I had this

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,180
calculator for more advanced math a

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:09,080
programmable calculator well some of my

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,080
friends used it to cheat at exam okay

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:18,780
I'm not putting seniors who put it back

00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:21,720
in the room good

00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,849
well I use it mostly to actually program

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,110
games that when I I realized that there

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,039
was an actual thing called like a

00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,250
programming language it was basic but I

00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:33,419
programmed things like a dichotomy

00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,199
random things that I would ask my friend

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:39,240
to play with and program thus with a

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,789
minesweeper to once which has like the

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,120
worst user experience ever but was still

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,889
proud of it and then I was like yeah

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,380
yeah okay computer science that seems

00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:51,449
like something I really like and I would

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,490
probably allow me if I want to at some

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:58,050
point go back to archaeology or

00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,240
exobiology even whatever because really

00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,710
computer science is used in lots of

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:07,229
fields and I just discovered that and

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:11,279
this time was quite late and now let's

00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:13,139
just share my own personal experience

00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,969
if I remember correctly I might be

00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,849
mistaken but if I remember correctly in

00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:23,759
my high school in the last year of

00:08:16,849 --> 00:08:26,729
science we were about 50% of women which

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,889
i think is also quite unusual in France

00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:32,069
but I think that's the figure that we

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:34,740
had however if you look at my next step

00:08:32,069 --> 00:08:36,990
in my education which was my preparatory

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,550
class for engineering school you can see

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:44,069
the figure dropping to 20 percent so I

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:48,389
think we were about 10 in the class of

00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:51,839
50 person so I also don't know if you

00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:53,540
are familiar with the French system it's

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,730
kind of weird

00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:02,639
I'm just saying well after your and your

00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,279
18 year old diploma you can go to uni

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,620
but you can also choose another path for

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,689
science or sales or economics for

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,079
instance which are schools great schools

00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:15,870
they are called in French and for the

00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,029
most prestigious one you have to go to a

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,459
preparatory class for two or three years

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:23,100
and then you are allowed to go to the

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:27,149
contest and that will accept you to the

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,850
school so I was accepted in I think it

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:34,230
was one of the most difficult

00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:36,149
preparatory class in France and still I

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,800
remember there were some couple of guys

00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:40,949
that were making nasty comments about

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,779
the grades of the few women in the class

00:09:40,949 --> 00:09:45,689
and at this time I was like yeah you

00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,639
know dishes to just and just bad people

00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:51,509
that they are just not the majority of

00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:53,459
people it was still very nasty that's

00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,379
just my own personal experience but if

00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:58,649
you look at actual that is typically

00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:05,689
relevant figures on the left are figures

00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:09,449
from France so basically after a science

00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:12,779
specific high school and 31 percent of

00:10:09,449 --> 00:10:17,399
the winning there and choose the task in

00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,740
hard science and technology for 53

00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,120
percent of othman so that might explain

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:25,120
well to drop conform and in the UK

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,050
because I live in the UK

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:33,150
now among people graduating from

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:35,350
computer science you need 13% are women

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:39,310
now Microsoft did a very interesting

00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:41,950
study quite recently but when girls

00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,540
start to lose interest in STEM subjects

00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:45,670
so this one is actually about when they

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:48,730
start becoming interested in them and

00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:53,200
it's at about 11 year old in most of

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:55,089
Europe but the drop is at 15 years old

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,430
so there's something happening that that

00:10:55,089 --> 00:11:03,070
make them lose their interest in this

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:04,839
topic now they also try to understand

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,690
what are the main factor that might keep

00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:10,720
them interested in this topic and are

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,900
things like having a role model that you

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,470
can identify with having teacher mentors

00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:22,060
in teacher things that helped me to when

00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:27,250
I chose this path right having something

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:29,560
which is grounded etc on the Left it's a

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,140
picture of I get I get is actually my

00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:34,830
boyfriend's best friend and she is one

00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:40,060
of the co-founder of the women on res

00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:45,070
which is dedicated to mentoring women

00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:47,290
into working and discovering Ruby and

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,180
she told me that actually when she was

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,650
really young she was really bad at math

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:54,250
because actually she was bad a

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:56,320
theoretical math but she had some

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:58,240
teachers tell her that you will never be

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,130
able to become like a programmer you're

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:05,080
so bad at maths and anyway you were

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:08,350
women it really happened to her and yet

00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,820
she's not very good developer so she

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,580
goes back and speak in school and

00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,500
explained that actually is possible and

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,820
that you can do it and she realized

00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:23,050
actually she was good at math but that

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:24,310
from ground it's mass so we all told you

00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:26,290
about the French system and the

00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,150
engineering school too and starotech was

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:30,190
my engineering school it's a great

00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,110
school because actually the first year

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,240
you still do a bit of everything and I

00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:37,200
loved it so even at history going to

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,980
physics computing probabilities I say

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,139
okay I have to choose some

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,190
mixture we all get computer science and

00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:47,920
robots that's all so that's what I did

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:51,070
it's also noteworthy that we were a

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,889
record-breaking number of 40% of women

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,300
in this year and I think it was the

00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:56,860
record-breaking year in the whole of

00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,410
France for the engineering schools at

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:02,019
that time and also for that school later

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,449
on it just dropped to about 30% which i

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:08,529
think is the current ratio now in France

00:13:04,449 --> 00:13:10,449
for most engineering schools then I had

00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:13,060
an internship in exile aid which was

00:13:10,449 --> 00:13:17,019
awesome because I was working on

00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:20,170
statistical computational linguistics so

00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:22,260
I loved languages love computing what

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,670
like yay the mix of post was also a

00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:27,370
really great team

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:29,910
and then I actually spent seven years in

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:33,339
algebra which is now Softbank robotics

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:37,060
so I Libran was at this time a French

00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:38,529
startup which was creating robots you

00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,449
can see the pictures of the robots

00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:46,420
they're really cute this one is called

00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:49,149
now yet with seven really good years I

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:51,579
started as a nap developer for the

00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:54,130
robots and I was the only full-time

00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:56,709
female software engineer at this time in

00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:01,180
the company we were company about 40

00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:04,029
people at this time and then in 2013 I

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,339
was promoted as a team lead and I was

00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,110
the first one of the few I don't

00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:15,010
remember about female software leads at

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:18,149
this time so really good to work with

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:21,250
all those cute robots right but also

00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:22,990
something interesting is that all these

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,510
experiences and then after that moving

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,819
to the UK made me realize a lot of

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:31,480
things that I didn't really realize

00:14:27,819 --> 00:14:33,550
before so just to tell you what was my

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,949
mindset like about ten years ago I

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:38,199
thought the work should be like magical

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:42,100
just rainbows and unicorns and being all

00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:44,620
magical I thought that it made no sense

00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,670
for people not to be tolerant with each

00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:50,050
other but I think that I thought that

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:51,670
the world should change magically too

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,810
that basically as you know why because

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:54,790
interested in making

00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:57,400
sense and also I enjoyed being an

00:14:54,790 --> 00:15:00,310
outsider so when I told you about the

00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,410
figure that we were 20% of women in my

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:04,750
preparatory class at this time actually

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,690
I don't agency another program I sort of

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,810
saw a bit special or you know it's fine

00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,230
I don't know why it happens but it's

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:24,630
fine

00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:26,790
sure story I did change my mind later on

00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:29,140
there are a lot of things that happened

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,610
things that happened to me personally

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,470
things that happened to some of my

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,170
friends and so I started reading a lot

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,970
about topics about diversity and really

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:39,220
have changed my mind about the fact that

00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,990
yeah we still want to go from A to B B

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,760
being the ideal world but I don't happen

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:48,010
magically you have to do something there

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,779
are a lot of things right now you can

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,850
hear about for instance all the sexual

00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:53,800
harassment cases in uber and things like

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:55,480
that well to be fair things like that

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,900
happened to me and most of my female

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,510
friends in the industry and it is

00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,350
something that happens I'm mostly

00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:07,570
focused about gender here but there are

00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:10,420
other problems obviously but just

00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:12,450
weakened for instance we were at some

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,920
point trying out a face recognition

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,140
algorithm on our robot so it was a

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:22,780
third-party and software that we were

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:25,360
using and it works quite well until we

00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,850
asked our black colleagues to come and

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,430
try it and suddenly the robot just

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:35,650
couldn't recognize him and well that's

00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:43,510
not great I wonder why it happens oh

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:45,790
wait I know there's also the fact that

00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:48,940
most young girls now will have heard

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,560
about all those issues so it might be

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,270
difficult to actually engage them into

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,430
choosing this path so that might explain

00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:57,640
back to 20% figures that we had

00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:01,030
previously if not being special or

00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,830
anything and that's what I learned and

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,470
maybe now if we can do something about

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,500
it maybe we can go back to our ideal

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,500
world

00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:18,809
sorry

00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:28,179
okay are you stuck new it's fine there's

00:17:26,029 --> 00:17:31,070
something else that also have me change

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:33,980
my mind a lot was when I was working in

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:39,110
algebra on a project to help children

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:42,289
with autism so we were creating games

00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,000
and apps on the robot as well as the

00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:45,769
website for to help the teachers create

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,510
play lists of applications that will

00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:49,399
help the kids with their learning goals

00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:51,649
so really the robot wasn't here at all

00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:52,970
to replace the teacher it was a tool as

00:17:51,649 --> 00:17:55,190
they would use like iPads and things

00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:58,159
like that - right

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,590
the idea behind it is the robot is like

00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,649
a good interface between like a phone or

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:06,649
a tablet and a human being so it might

00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:08,990
be easier for them to apply what they

00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:11,960
learn on the robot - for instance human

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:14,720
beings etc also the robot is really

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,909
repetitive so it will always say do

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,159
something exactly the same way over and

00:18:16,909 --> 00:18:23,659
over again without get getting angry or

00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:25,970
judgmental and that's a good plus so

00:18:23,659 --> 00:18:31,179
maybe I will show you a picture from a

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:31,179
video so I managed to click

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:43,990
can you hear help teach a nonverbal

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,220
child how to communicate with loved ones

00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,960
what if an animator could bridge a

00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:53,180
visual child to an ever evolving

00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:55,040
community what if a researcher could

00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,020
implement innovative technology to

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,220
minimize over stimulation and children

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,470
and improve learning

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,750
[Music]

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,549
what if these people and others from

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:08,150
around the world came together on a

00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:10,130
journey to transform the classroom

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,780
[Applause]

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:15,510
combining talents to shape a better path

00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,250
for special education by allowing

00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,600
children to take their learning to the

00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:24,030
next level

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,030
opening up a world of possibilities

00:19:30,340 --> 00:20:08,430
[Music]

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,569
[Applause]

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,400
[Music]

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:23,700
[Applause]

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,490
[Music]

00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,600
you

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:32,000
[Applause]

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:35,099
[Music]

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,099
[Applause]

00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:41,060
helped shape the path and become a part

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,060
of the journey

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,680
remember the shotgun

00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:10,099
sorry

00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,099
[Music]

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:39,900
oh yeah this was quite a great project

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,300
to work for and I think that it really

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,400
change our lives as much as hopefully we

00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:48,030
change some of this kid's life

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,920
I still remember being in a inner class

00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:54,710
in Massachusetts so I think that's the

00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:57,780
class that you can see up there and

00:21:54,710 --> 00:22:01,710
there was this kid that wouldn't look us

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,930
in the eye when she was breaking us and

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,480
we put the robot in front of her and she

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,160
started to focus directly on the robot

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,170
and it was quite a great thing to see

00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:12,300
and apparently a few weeks later she

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,880
started to pay attention to other things

00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:18,350
like a drawing of a frog on the door and

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,210
started to to greet it in the morning

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,160
and so kudos to the people I work with

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,430
there for instance Jesse and Aleksandra

00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:29,550
Aleksandra being the woman on the bottom

00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:32,100
left she also has an association in

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:35,150
Romania that helps kids with autism and

00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,820
she's an amazing person

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:41,040
now when I talk about that people ask me

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:46,350
why I left algebra and why I am in the

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:49,200
UK now first I just wanted a change I

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:52,350
guess after seven years there or so it

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,060
was a dream to move to London and still

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,020
is difficult to find something as cool

00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:58,530
as the robot Hey but I found code for

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,660
life

00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:05,820
woohoo so code for life it's a

00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,710
non-profit initiative that delivers and

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,990
free and open source coding games to

00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,570
help all kids learn computing that's the

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:14,460
mission statement of the project now

00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:16,620
people in the UK know a battle cat oh

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:19,850
okay Doe is an online supermarket so

00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:24,270
usually the reaction is like wait what

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:26,460
where is your cat or doing that here is

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:30,450
why actually behind okay - there's okay

00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:32,610
- technology it's a technology company

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:37,020
and its really keen on helping with

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:39,990
education also there's no Cato

00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,670
Foundation is only no Cod oh and we are

00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:45,990
under the umbrella of the foundation in

00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:47,790
2014 the UK decided to in

00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,170
reduce confusion in the primary school

00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:51,929
curriculum and I think it was the first

00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:54,300
country to do so and so that's why the

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:56,160
group of volunteers at Aikido started to

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:58,710
develop some good in games to have the

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:03,059
kids but also the teacher to have the

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:05,309
teacher teach the kids basically I think

00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,590
that our CTO just put it very nicely

00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:10,770
that with the long code so I won't read

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:13,950
it but basically talking about learning

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,900
how to program as just the basics of

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,090
running that is like a useful thing of

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:25,970
useful skill for like anyone especially

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:28,140
in our world today now there are some

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,600
really good people that talked about

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:33,660
that and the videos will be in my slide

00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,910
so you can watch them later one is in

00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:39,360
Linda Lucas

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:40,830
she wrote the hello Ruby book which she

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,410
calls a delightful way to teach kids

00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:46,380
about computers and she's got some

00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,940
really nice quotes when his little girls

00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,880
don't know they're not supposed to like

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:53,490
computers so yeah and also if we change

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:59,100
a kid's perception of what's possible we

00:24:53,490 --> 00:25:01,200
can change the entire world so yeah

00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,320
decided is that if you manage to teach

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,110
the kids at an early age maybe you will

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,270
have more kids understand the power of

00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:11,040
computing and also enjoy just enjoying

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:14,150
it and just know that maybe it's

00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:18,030
actually for them so that would be nice

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:20,040
another brilliant otis by kat lemon it

00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:21,450
was at PyCon UK last year which was an

00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:24,050
amazing conference i don't know if you

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,670
were there

00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:29,400
she just explained a lot about why do

00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:31,260
kids need to learn computing and she

00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,700
also talks about the fact that when he's

00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,150
grounded it's really good

00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,280
some kids really love games and the fact

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,900
that they can see it as related to games

00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:45,630
or programming games will really

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:47,580
interest them I think is that yeah I

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:52,260
said we were actually teaching the

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:55,440
teachers how to teach computing like why

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,750
is that so first most of the teachers

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,610
when the UK and put computing in the

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,480
curriculum was like okay

00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:04,830
I have no idea what's happening there

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,509
some of them were afraid that the kids

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,429
might be better than they are at

00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:12,690
computing they didn't feel really

00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:15,629
considered enough or so yeah a cat

00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:17,309
have a lack of resources of energy

00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:20,730
really it's more I think it's more

00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:22,830
mental energy than that rest time then

00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:24,509
if they just go online and try to find

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:26,929
some resources here I can think it's

00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:32,669
like 25 million last time I checked so

00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:34,529
okay what is going on so what does

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,210
explain why we are trying to do some

00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:41,600
tools that would be useful for both

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:45,269
really so the first game is rapid Rooter

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,169
it's a game for primary school which

00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:51,090
teaches broccoli and Python so broccoli

00:26:48,169 --> 00:26:53,220
is a visual programming language we

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,429
really like scratch which is open source

00:26:53,220 --> 00:27:00,779
and created by Google and Python what is

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:03,480
that language or source rapid yeah I did

00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:06,029
really to have a progression in making

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:08,190
them understand the computing concept so

00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:10,109
it's just not learning about syntax it's

00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:13,200
learning about logical thinking and

00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:15,359
algorithm so I can either show you a

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:22,799
video of me playing the game or I can do

00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:26,669
a live coding session okay like reading

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:33,859
niches but maybe the answers are cached

00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:33,859
some with a budget just a moment

00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:56,050
it's going to be interesting without the

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:56,050
Supreme mirror come on

00:27:56,670 --> 00:28:02,690
I think I messed up with the settings

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,690
gay

00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:19,529
so this is rapid Ruta and this is the

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:27,720
first level of rapid Rita which is very

00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:30,899
difficult as you're gonna see okay not

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,700
cheating see so did you program a van to

00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:34,409
go alongside the road and at first you

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,340
only have like a very limited set of

00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:37,340
block lip gloss

00:28:45,280 --> 00:29:00,720
sorry yay live coding is working thank

00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:06,660
you

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:09,460
where's my mouse now haha its back okay

00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:14,680
another thing is the next level of this

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:16,690
episode are just a bit more difficult in

00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,540
terms of the route but you still have a

00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:25,300
very small number of blocks that you can

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:33,720
use so for instance if you go to level

00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:38,440
12 you can see that the road is slightly

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:40,390
more complicated and yet you only have

00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,220
to like copy paste move forward turn

00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,780
left and right like a quite a number of

00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:56,680
times so that's why I actually won't do

00:29:43,780 --> 00:30:00,450
it not yet but I will

00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,450
spoilers the projected open source

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,640
another thing is it might get quite a

00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,420
bit boring to copy/paste all those

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:18,040
things so after when we actually teach

00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:19,600
loops loops and conditions it actually

00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,930
makes sense because then they can just

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,150
use a repeat loop to make it happen and

00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:27,400
a like oh I don't have to copy paste

00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:29,320
everything 100 times I love repeat loops

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,000
we just grounded knowledge it's not just

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,680
like say so you've got like a for loop

00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,300
and then it happens and you are boring

00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,260
no it's just grounded and they

00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:45,850
understand the need of that in quite a

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:48,160
deep way and after that we actually go

00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,930
to Python but I would say in a

00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:56,770
progressive way so that appeases which

00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:58,200
are blockly to buy some episodes stay

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:02,670
here things

00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,670
so introduction to Python

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:10,930
here's iPhone yay and you can see

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:16,840
everything is also completely that's so

00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:18,730
easy but you can see that you program in

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:24,880
blog clip but you can see what it looks

00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:29,260
like in Python semi propelled live

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:34,930
coding that's what is cool I just work

00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:37,630
the same and later on you just program

00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:40,510
directly in bison so but again in use to

00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:42,160
it thanks to those episodes so just all

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,760
that knowledge being very progressively

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,970
done

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,100
so the first levels are really five six

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,810
year old we also have like unplugged

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,340
activity for the teachers that they can

00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:53,860
print especially for the kids that

00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:57,450
concrete and with later episodes are

00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,450
more for than eleven years old

00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,700
I try to go back to the presentation

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,520
that's for me thanks

00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:32,420
I love light dimmers so yeah we do offer

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:37,040
tooth and plug activities for the

00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:38,900
teachers but we also offer a lot of PDFs

00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,140
with teaching materials and things like

00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:43,429
that

00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:45,410
they can really use to really not to

00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,780
have to create exercises really so we

00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:50,030
have one teacher that told us once this

00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:55,010
teacher we really love code for life

00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:57,470
because we don't have to teach well

00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:01,820
decision noted spank and I quote you

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:04,040
this is a sweet

00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:11,090
most of those materials were created

00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:12,860
thanks to Sharon Harrison she was she

00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:15,380
was our education consultant at the

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,049
beginning of the project and she was an

00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:21,530
awesome lady and suddenly she she left

00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:23,540
us in 2015 and so the new redesign of

00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,429
website is dedicated to her and she was

00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:29,630
an incredible role model for teachers

00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:31,100
and for the kids she worked with not

00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:33,080
talking about role models I don't know

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,030
if you saw the video when I was playing

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,220
the looped episode there was a video

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:40,610
with that tot house and that I closed

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:43,100
but we do have lots of videos like that

00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:44,870
in the project and it's actually okay I

00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:46,280
do people talking about what they do I

00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:56,390
talk I do and then explaining the

00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:59,059
concepts like this one for instance hi

00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,630
everyone today I'm with Helen II see no

00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:02,240
suffering

00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,650
yeah Carly fellow review Helen please

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,660
tell us a little bit about what you do

00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:07,190
yeah sure my job is to write a software

00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,600
that helps us to keep track of your

00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,220
shopping from the point at which it

00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,260
means our warehouse off until it arrives

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,179
at your house this includes the software

00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,440
and drivers handheld devices which tells

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:17,389
them the order in which they need to

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,130
drop something off how to get to

00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:23,040
customer housing which iPhones are

00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:24,780
and worry about such shopping is I write

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,280
food every day and use lots of different

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,830
programming languages that you'll be

00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,220
learning about in future like Java and -

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:33,780
what sex in the actress or the next bit

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,520
of the apps used is yourself statement

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,980
which repeat like these statements

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,930
you've been using so fast just like if

00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,970
maintenance if-else statements help

00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:44,250
computer to make decisions so in a

00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,990
slightly more clever way they let the

00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,570
computer checks two or more things when

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:50,520
deciding what to do we all use if else

00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,860
statements in everyday lives for example

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:55,140
if it's a weekday you know you need to

00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,970
go to school but if it's not you know

00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:58,680
you can stay at home just like for the

00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,450
if-statement lot you can tell the band

00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,180
to turn right if there is a rotor right

00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:05,400
but if there's no row to the right then

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,680
the van can't move forward we have a

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,600
statement let's say but if there is no

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,790
roads that right and the values that are

00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:14,100
left that way the van can decide which

00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:15,930
way it needs to go on its own and find

00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,420
its way to the house without you having

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:19,320
to put in every single step that's great

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,990
thanks Helen

00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:23,640
I'll give it to go now if else statement

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,600
sound cool I'm going to learn more about

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,600
them are you

00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,579
[Music]

00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,760
where those funny videos can actually

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:46,340
help create role models for the kids

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,290
because you see all kind of people at

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,310
work at OCAD oh and explain about what

00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:50,870
they do and that can be really

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,450
motivating to see someone from the

00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:55,520
industry telling you what they do and

00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,320
explain you fun concepts in this place

00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,060
with something we're actually trying to

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,370
do more so we'll try later to get maybe

00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:04,030
some more videos and print them them

00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:06,440
better in our website for instance

00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,630
speaking of which what we did a lot of

00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,870
user interviews in the past year because

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:13,600
we wanted to redo our main photo because

00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:15,710
it looked like the thing on the left

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,140
that's the main website where the

00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:22,910
teachers can log in register their

00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:25,100
classes etc and it was a bit grave

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:26,630
people would just click on the big rapid

00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,240
water picture what would you expect when

00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:30,470
clicking on the rapid water picture to

00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,720
go to rapid water maybe

00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:37,940
well no just did nothing so where our

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,010
users were the confused so we spent well

00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,930
James which is our awesome UX designer

00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:44,570
spent a lot of time talking to to

00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:48,070
teachers and also kids to make sense of

00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:51,740
what we needed to change really

00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:54,230
so that's why it looks like the website

00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,910
on the right now since the 20th the 20th

00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,910
of June so he he is quite recent

00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:05,520
now things is on the left you have a

00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:08,070
screenshot of an example of the Python

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,010
code from Rapid Rooter in one of the

00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:13,230
last levels still it's quite different

00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:15,750
if you look at the Python code from our

00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:18,450
code base as you can see on the right

00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:19,910
that's so different but still you put

00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:21,870
the drongo framework you've got

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,370
object-oriented programming you like you

00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:25,020
okay

00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:31,200
we don't really teach that to the 11

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:34,160
year old in wrap it up not yet but we

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,410
are working on the game for the 12 to 16

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,680
which has a very cool working name of a

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:42,420
I MMO or I move which actually means

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,540
artificial intelligence massively

00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,510
multiplayer online it's a good name so I

00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,950
don't know what is going to be crooked

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:53,160
which is really for secondary school

00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:56,310
pupils the idea is to teach also Python

00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:01,800
and also artificial intelligence in a

00:37:56,310 --> 00:38:06,180
really fun way now we did a lot of user

00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:09,090
research with teenagers but also with

00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,950
teachers because if the game appeals to

00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,840
teenager is fine but if the teachers

00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,490
think it's awful they will never use it

00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:18,420
in schools and that's also what we want

00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:23,160
to do we spoke with someone from

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:25,280
computing at school which is a group in

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,740
the in the UK which is quite quite great

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,120
and she told us okay but it's a nice

00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,460
idea that you have to just pay attention

00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,350
and make sure that all the kids will

00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,300
love it etcetera and were like okay we

00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,240
did some more research well it looks

00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,450
like everyone at the age seem to like

00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,670
game and then we actually dug a bit

00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:49,830
deeper and we found a oldest research

00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:51,720
about for instance the fact that this is

00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:55,050
a good article that you can resolve it

00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,720
with the link on the right about how

00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:03,210
GCSE she lives girls as we already saw

00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:05,310
and poor kids behind a colleague of us

00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,890
which it was actually a volunteer as

00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:11,880
good for life and told us that well if

00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:14,550
at this time he could have taken compute

00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,110
like before he was 16 yet we probably

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,380
wouldn't because he didn't have a

00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:22,950
computer at home it was quite difficult

00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,170
to then do your exercises etc if you

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,180
don't really have materials and

00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:28,800
apparently it just happens that they

00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:30,660
actually are left away because of that

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,280
which means that if you don't think that

00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:33,870
you can become good in a frontier you

00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,450
can go to uni for instance then you

00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:40,500
don't do computing at uni and you are

00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:43,820
really left behind which is awful as for

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,820
the girls where we saw what happened

00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,110
apparently they all heard about the

00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:51,090
problem that might happen in the

00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:55,440
industry and they don't necessarily want

00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:59,940
to live through that so it's some sort

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,490
of official circles as going on so

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,220
really try to pay more attention to what

00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:08,040
we were doing in terms of web products

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:11,130
and UX and there is something that we

00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:12,540
came up is so which ID for the game

00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:14,430
should we have which story should we

00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:18,420
have behind so it's really like story

00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:25,350
based and we decided to go with the time

00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:29,070
travel ID so my doctor who dress I love

00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:30,630
time traveller it's bright but the idea

00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:33,090
with that is that all we could have

00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:35,340
different maps for levels you have like

00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:37,590
your screen grab of our futuristic level

00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,390
here which is also just a

00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,870
work-in-progress might not look like

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,700
that at all it's a market but you could

00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:47,100
like build your own time machine and

00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,810
maybe go back in the past which means

00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:51,150
that we could have a lot of different

00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:52,920
areas that might appeal to everyone

00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:56,640
depending on your taste so we could have

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,010
like a dinosaur level we could have

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,920
Haley on Japan we could have ancient

00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:07,220
Egypt we could have a lot of things

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,220
oh and Victorian England etc steampunk

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:14,700
also it started as an idea which was

00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:17,040
really challenging but also competitive

00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,410
and we are trying to find ways to

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,120
incorporate more collaboration with the

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:24,770
kids to make them also learn about

00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:24,770
teamwork and make it nicer

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,460
and trying also to make sure that they

00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,550
will be able to create an avatar that

00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:39,160
look like them so for instance if avatar

00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:41,680
is now called evil Selene Eve or Selene

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:47,670
Selene is me that we were selling that's

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,670
my evil twin according to to to James

00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:57,640
some ozone except that we have for

00:41:53,770 --> 00:42:02,400
instance first we have about one cell

00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:04,840
one one hundred thousand users browse

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,480
now still the website is right now only

00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,300
in English so what we did is that we

00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:12,820
opened our project we open translation

00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:15,430
for our project on crowding so everybody

00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,810
can go and help translate the project

00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:21,010
that will be links on the last slide for

00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:24,220
instance we found out that we have a lot

00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,930
of users that come from Brazil so that

00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:28,510
would be really awesome if we could get

00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:38,200
all the translation done in Portuguese

00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:40,890
position we're also planning on having

00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,150
an iOS app for rapid Rooter

00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:44,980
because first we found out in Google

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,920
Analytics that a lot of teachers use

00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:49,540
iPads but also it's easier to make an

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,790
offline game which means that the kids

00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:57,190
that are not allowed to go to Internet

00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:58,870
at home can still play but also in terms

00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:01,420
of accessibility so one of the teachers

00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:03,280
that we met told us that two kids that

00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,050
confuse a mouse for instance it might be

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,110
really grateful to be able to play rapid

00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:09,760
water without a mouse we also started I

00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:11,080
hope it's going to be soon

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,420
I don't know we're starting a

00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:16,510
partnership with the Essex library

00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,960
services so Essex is a region in in

00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:21,930
Britain and the council have will lose

00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:24,460
libraries and they want to put a

00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:25,960
shortcut for code for life on all the

00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,230
computers in the libraries and that

00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,600
would be great for for instance and the

00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:35,140
kids only a dose because it's a fun game

00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:37,750
for everyone but don't have access to

00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:40,470
internet or computers at home while they

00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:40,470
can still play

00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:50,290
yes time travel it's awesome sometimes I

00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:53,170
really wished I could time travel I sort

00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:58,540
of wish that maybe instead of having all

00:43:53,170 --> 00:44:02,740
those rows of pink toys for girls with

00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:04,630
weirdo houses with no stairs I had

00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:08,770
things like goldieblox I don't know if

00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:11,490
you know that it's amazing I mean c'mon

00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:15,609
that invention mentioned so to actually

00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:20,650
games which were created a few years ago

00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:22,420
in the US and really you can build you

00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:24,160
on symmetry to teach engineering to

00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,710
young girls and it's amazing I actually

00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,760
want one so I'm trying to find an excuse

00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:32,290
to buy one maybe I don't I don't know

00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,330
but it's all good to want to travel back

00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:37,869
in the past but maybe we should think

00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:40,210
about traveling to the future and try to

00:44:37,869 --> 00:44:43,030
make sure that it's a good world that

00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,950
we're going to reach so make sure that

00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,660
all those tools that we wish we had we

00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:50,890
actually are programming them for the

00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:53,109
next generations making sure that

00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:55,630
instead of like one or two role models

00:44:53,109 --> 00:45:00,150
that you might identify with here I put

00:44:55,630 --> 00:45:02,890
a lovely you have a whole bunch of

00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,830
mentors and mentoring organization that

00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:07,570
help you here I put just a tiny view of

00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:09,820
people and organizations that I know

00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:13,030
that I think are doing a great job for

00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:17,170
diversity and helping the current and

00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:20,800
new generations for instance on the top

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:22,660
with the robots this is Angelica she has

00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:26,589
a PhD in robotics and she was at

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:29,080
Southbank robotics she's an amazing

00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:32,680
woman and she talks at events and at

00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:34,450
women in tech events of course you might

00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,720
know anne-marie Macedon the creator of

00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:39,369
the Mets and former child genius I guess

00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,500
that I already told you about Linda

00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:44,109
Lucas

00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:46,960
Alexandra Helen from Hokkaido and also

00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:49,270
on the bottom left is Jose he's a

00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,849
colleague of mine and he's a mentor for

00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:52,480
a most bursaries which is a charity in

00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:57,480
the UK

00:45:52,480 --> 00:46:00,609
educated to help black British men to

00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:04,380
which are academically able and very to

00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:07,270
mentor them so it also knows one person

00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:11,980
obviously jungle girls by ladies

00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:13,900
amazing so no other mentors of today and

00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:18,730
maybe you can be the mentors of today

00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:20,770
and tomorrow the code for life oranges I

00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:21,490
think there are such people they are

00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:25,960
really awesome

00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:29,260
and they're really dedicated to really

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,480
making sure that they inspire back the

00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,080
generation of kids as green my heart

00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:39,540
which we were inspired before we're also

00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:42,160
having a lot of fun when we go together

00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,710
on the picture you can see all those

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:46,540
great people for instance James our UX

00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,540
designer Chris that helped create the

00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:51,310
game Ruth she's our front-end mental

00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,560
nichette and Jack and they helped on the

00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:55,330
iOS etc everyone is doing something

00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,560
great or andrea which is our data

00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:01,420
scientist volunteer bottom right are our

00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:03,820
polish volunteers from Okkadu poland

00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:06,580
they are involved in code for life but

00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:12,550
also in activities such as green light

00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:17,109
for girls or mind the gap and also we

00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:20,890
have a pet by nosers this is traicee

00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:24,670
traicee is actually our token in our

00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:29,020
standard meeting with the team we talked

00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:32,940
with sometimes I think we're really like

00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:35,680
a team dedicated to making change and

00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:39,359
actually the project was nominated this

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:44,380
year at the women in IT awhile which was

00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:46,270
quite proud of it at this time really

00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,460
learning also because it's actually a

00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:52,270
metal learning project and they teach

00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,470
children while running themselves thing

00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:55,150
so some of them actually taught

00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:57,490
themselves Python to work on that

00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:01,930
project really the idea is to create

00:47:57,490 --> 00:48:05,350
games that will manage to reach all the

00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:06,340
kids before the truth the GCSE level

00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:08,260
before they chose

00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:10,780
levels and to make sure that we managed

00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:15,210
to inspire them at this point in life

00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:18,130
before the interest dropped for instance

00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:26,440
but the still said are still a lot more

00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:28,480
to do so if you want to know more about

00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:30,850
the project or maybe even get involved

00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:34,240
here is the cheat sheet with all the

00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:36,370
contact details so the website social

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,930
media but also our github links there

00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:45,920
are quite a few and and our translation

00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:48,320
platform thank you

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:57,900
[Music]

00:48:48,320 --> 00:49:01,810
[Applause]

00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:13,090
all right anybody have questions I have

00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:15,790
a microphone so do you have any data how

00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:18,220
many people from those who started to

00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:20,380
use the program to teach themselves

00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:21,970
programming how many finish to the next

00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:26,230
level and how many of them actually

00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:28,300
continue to like grow as developers we

00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:30,790
don't have that data yet so the project

00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:33,250
was started in 2014 for primary school

00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:35,410
kids so they are not there yet

00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:37,120
we are I don't remember the fear but

00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:39,010
we'll have a few people that register as

00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,540
independent students it's also something

00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:42,040
you can do in the program so you're not

00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,220
part of a school but if you want to

00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:47,050
learn programming without all the cheap

00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,630
things that the teachers have in their

00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:53,950
account you can do that but we don't

00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:56,170
register their age when they do that but

00:49:53,950 --> 00:50:06,160
we're hoping that in 10 years it will be

00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:09,640
completed thanks for the presentation

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,620
very nice do you have data or do you

00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:16,150
know how many children are registered

00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:17,860
today in this coding programs and what

00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:21,870
do you think what how many you can reach

00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:25,390
in the future so right now we have about

00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:29,080
100,000 users and which are mostly

00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:32,020
children because it's about yet the

00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:35,980
ratio for teachers is different so we

00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:37,750
have I would say 90,000 children all

00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,700
over the world which are registered then

00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,230
now if you mode I probably use it

00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,580
without being registered but that's

00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:48,340
difficult to understand the overlap and

00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:50,830
now I would say I would like to have

00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,540
like billions into sheriffís yeah we're

00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,400
trying to do it one step at a time but

00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:58,510
first making sure that we also inspired

00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:02,460
the teenagers and more people in the

00:50:58,510 --> 00:51:02,460
world by hopefully having translations

00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:11,380
so at first let me thank you for your

00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,990
work I have a daughter though I'm pretty

00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:15,700
sure the tabs and do you can you

00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:18,070
elaborate a bit how it relates to other

00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:20,050
initiatives in Europe like code your

00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:23,410
life or so on we work with them together

00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:27,250
with a fun kind of of exchange of ideas

00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:29,020
between you and them I think there's

00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:31,810
something called code your life I'm not

00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:34,330
make it back pretty small so but I think

00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:35,980
the elementary school who my older boy

00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:38,380
goes to work together with code your

00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:40,930
life which is sounds really like you but

00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,790
just I think it's sponsored by Microsoft

00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:45,370
or whatever oh I don't know buddy that's

00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:47,110
good but org too which is I mean just

00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,850
just you then maybe just your Google

00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:50,860
code your life I think it's a Microsoft

00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,660
initiative they use turtle instead of

00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:54,940
the car thing all services building

00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:59,130
blocks programming and also especially

00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:59,130
for kids I think yeah check Thanks

00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:09,040
with the current system is it possible

00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,720
for the kids to actually design their

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,810
own patterns and then implement

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,110
solutions and if this is possible can

00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:19,210
they communicate with each other to like

00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:24,040
discuss these solutions and like maybe

00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:25,540
help each other to learn so right now

00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,650
they can do different things so for

00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,690
instance they can create their own

00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,820
levels and they can share it with the

00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,980
class and the teachers so program their

00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:34,600
own map so they design the road and they

00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,750
put all the props like the trees etc

00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:43,090
they can choose the blocks or if it's

00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:46,120
Python etc now most of teachers actually

00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:47,950
use the levels in a collaborative way so

00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,230
they actually ask the kids to

00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:52,390
collaborate on some levels and work

00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:54,570
together so like now programming reading

00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:57,190
in front of reputa so they do that a lot

00:52:54,570 --> 00:53:00,100
now we don't have that implemented as

00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,870
for instance like your chat whatever for

00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,640
security reasons from the one can talk

00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,350
to the kid like that however we have a

00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,660
very nice idea thanks to some teenagers

00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:09,520
for our new game so the game for

00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,260
teenagers they suggested that we

00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,630
pre-programmed some comments that they

00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:16,210
could send to each other so that nobody

00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:17,349
would actually hug them to send some bad

00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:21,089
messages and

00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:21,089
communicator bits that's interesting

00:53:27,719 --> 00:53:34,239
thank you very interesting talk from my

00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:37,089
experience in the industry the biggest

00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:38,739
fear of women not coming to the industry

00:53:37,089 --> 00:53:41,109
is because they are afraid that it's a

00:53:38,739 --> 00:53:44,529
male-dominated world and they cannot

00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:47,349
make it I want to learn what is your

00:53:44,529 --> 00:53:48,910
impression why do you think it's

00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:53,289
happening that you don't see many women

00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:55,839
in the IT industry so I think I might

00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:57,609
have said earlier the thing about the

00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,849
lack of role models that they can

00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:02,049
identify with a virtuous circle going on

00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:05,079
if they know that there will be a

00:54:02,049 --> 00:54:06,609
minority and that maybe some sexism some

00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:07,719
sexist comments might happen and things

00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:10,029
like that they might be afraid to

00:54:07,719 --> 00:54:11,400
actually join so there are a lot of

00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:14,440
things like that which are happening

00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,089
also some people I know they were being

00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:18,699
told from early childhood that it was

00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:20,529
amazing and so if you are not strong

00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:22,900
minded enough your majesty I want to do

00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:24,369
that so if you ask me that's a bit

00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:27,099
difficult because I am still in the

00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:30,359
industry so it's difficult for me to

00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:33,039
also relate to people that are not there

00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:35,469
we were talking about that with some

00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,329
colleagues but about that I know that

00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:39,039
for me for instance I was very strong

00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:40,839
fighting when I was a kid and I was like

00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,579
no you can tell me I can do that I will

00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:44,619
do it but you can't ask everyone to be

00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:47,319
like that that's not possible

00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:49,059
you have to make a leap as if you are

00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:50,680
privileged you have to make an effort to

00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:55,299
include other people that's how it would

00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:57,309
work so I think that's mostly why and it

00:54:55,299 --> 00:55:00,039
happens so that's why initiatives that

00:54:57,309 --> 00:55:02,739
helped everyone understand that it's fun

00:55:00,039 --> 00:55:05,019
and also that they can do it and have

00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:08,819
role models we are hoping that it might

00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:08,819
help change and balance

00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:21,359
hello thank you for your talk is our

00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:25,020
program for training teachers and Python

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:28,520
to be able to teach the children sorry

00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:34,829
is a program for teaching the teachers

00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:37,170
Python in England yes all the computing

00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:39,960
at school and barefoot computing they

00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:42,780
are helping the teachers with getting in

00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:44,309
power with the skills include for life

00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:46,470
what we do is that we have also all

00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:48,210
those PDFs that explain the solutions to

00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:49,770
the teachers so they exactly know for

00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,680
instance what is the right Python code

00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:55,290
for the Tison episodes to really help

00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:56,849
them make it and those who start button

00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:58,619
that they have so they can see what's

00:55:56,849 --> 00:56:02,819
going on and help the kids directly when

00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:04,349
there's a problem and yeah then also a

00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:05,880
lot of I would say rota for the

00:56:04,349 --> 00:56:08,400
association that I probably don't know

00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,290
about but yeah I think that computing a

00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:12,270
school there for computing in the UK are

00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:13,920
quite quite great to have the teachers

00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:16,319
there are so people like a climbing

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:20,250
which took two teachers and actually

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:24,559
have mentor so the BBC micro bit also

00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,559
doing great things at school in the UK a

00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:31,859
follow-up question to that Minnesota's a

00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:35,609
big increase in the Python community in

00:56:31,859 --> 00:56:37,290
England does that mean there's a big

00:56:35,609 --> 00:56:39,000
increase in the Python community in

00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:41,250
England I actually don't know those

00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,710
figures about the increase of the bison

00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:50,210
community but that's a good point

00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:50,210
uncheck any other questions

00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,360
you

00:56:57,829 --> 00:57:03,719
thank you for your talk my question was

00:57:01,049 --> 00:57:07,079
a bit why did you choose Tyson and not

00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:12,659
any other language to do the whole code

00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:15,119
for life in the game and everything so

00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:18,599
first we're so to teach broccoli so

00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:21,149
that's to encourage well there is that

00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:23,009
so I don't know the figures but still

00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:25,499
Python is becoming really famous and

00:57:23,009 --> 00:57:27,239
it's I think a while ago it was

00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:29,009
JavaScript before more famous and now

00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:31,199
it's mostly pythons which just goes with

00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:33,089
the trend of teachers teaching it and

00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,979
also there are also two other tools

00:57:33,089 --> 00:57:36,479
available online to teach different

00:57:34,979 --> 00:57:38,130
things so some teachers might want to

00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:41,219
use all of them to teach different

00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:43,069
syntaxes it's also very simple to learn

00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:45,929
because it's very user friendly

00:57:43,069 --> 00:57:49,380
especially if you just do a tiny subset

00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:50,459
of Python and so we just I just make

00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:53,039
sense

00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:55,499
now for the game for teenagers we are

00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,149
also planning to offer Python levels at

00:57:55,499 --> 00:57:58,889
some point we were thinking of later

00:57:57,149 --> 00:58:02,039
maybe expanding that so you could

00:57:58,889 --> 00:58:03,599
program your avatar in a different

00:58:02,039 --> 00:58:07,169
language but we're not sure about

00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:13,790
prioritizing that right now other

00:58:07,169 --> 00:58:14,490
questions okay well thank you so much

00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,660
[Applause]

00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,660
[Music]

00:58:17,770 --> 00:58:22,599
[Applause]

00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,599
