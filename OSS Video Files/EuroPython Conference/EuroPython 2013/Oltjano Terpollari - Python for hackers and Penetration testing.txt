welcome back everybody and welcome back

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:22,050
everybody so python is lately increasing

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:32,279
being used for security purposes and OT

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:37,050
on OH will explain us how thank you hi

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,730
everyone how are you nice so today we're

00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,000
going to talk about fighting for hackers

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,610
and penetration testing my name is

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,910
arianna I'm a computer geek I study

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,690
Computer Engineering in Albania a small

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:54,210
country in Europe so the first question

00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,930
is why should we use fighting for

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,789
hacking and penetration testing what

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,370
makes a good penetration tester is the

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:05,580
ability to create the crafty zone tools

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,260
in real time and that makes the

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,900
difference between a good penetration

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:14,460
tester and an excellent penetration

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:18,000
tester so by python offers the chance to

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:20,520
code quick scripts and it is a

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,710
multi-platform because there are times

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,439
when you do penetration testing and you

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:32,720
have to attack from other machines like

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:37,650
mac OS x ubuntu windows and python

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:40,380
offers offers to the penetration tester

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,720
the ability to port the exploit very

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,950
easy because you don't need to compile

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,759
the code so you can just install python

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:55,590
good version you like and just run the

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,229
script another thing that python offers

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:03,600
to penetration testers and harbors is

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:08,190
that it is reaching modules and is easy

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,069
to read if you look some c code or java

00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:12,439
code or other code

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:16,010
it's very hard to eat that code but when

00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:22,219
you do it Python it's like you learning

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:24,950
a very easy language it's very human

00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:27,230
frenzy and that's why I think that

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:31,639
python is good for penetration testing

00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:35,299
and hacking and the big plus that python

00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:39,159
has is that it has an interactive which

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:42,409
are interactive shell that offers the

00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,680
programmers to oh can I have some water

00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:44,680
please

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,590
the big plus is that it isn't directive

00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:18,950
language that means that you can taste

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:25,940
your own functions and find your errors

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:28,820
and then execute your scripts letting

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,060
your development environment so first

00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,030
thing is we have to download and install

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:38,470
Python this is the first thing then you

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:42,110
have to install third-party libraries

00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:45,680
some Python tools that are good for

00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:47,540
penetration our SQL map a city with

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,640
which is the show social engineer

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:56,000
toolkit PDF ID which is the tool for

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:59,000
doing PDF analyzes and sky p which is a

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,480
tool that he used to is use too many

00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,550
plate packet networks and the good thing

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:10,340
about scape is that Skippy allows the

00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:13,280
user to be free because you can create

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:18,109
your own package like you want and skip

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,410
it doesn't interpret things skip it just

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:24,169
decodes and let the human beings

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:26,930
interpret it or you can download

00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:32,180
backtrack or kali linux and everything

00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:36,100
is done but i think that backtrack and

00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:41,240
kali offer you an easy way to do things

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:43,700
but at the long term you're going to

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,070
struggle because when you learn things

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:49,130
to do any easy way and when you face

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:54,320
problems at a later time it will be hard

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:59,030
for you so i suggest to download these

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,910
tools there's like SQL map is et PDF ID

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:07,510
scaping installed by yourself and you'll

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:12,260
learn along the way so it's all about

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:15,440
sakis why is all about sockets we go

00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,120
sockets hello make possible for two

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,719
computers to connect to connect with

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,639
each other

00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:31,300
interchange information talk it's in

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:34,509
Python hello communication between any

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:37,240
kind of socket like unique sockets bsd

00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:41,729
sockets the Leigh allow you to create

00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,729
ECB connections to DB connections etc

00:05:43,229 --> 00:06:05,050
I'm just a bit so if you want to create

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:07,930
a server and client and you are creative

00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:12,580
you can basically hack because hacking

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:15,759
is not about doing the most scientific

00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:18,939
work it's about being creative and you

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:23,620
can create your own back doors you can

00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:27,089
create a program to turns to transfer

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,969
files from a client or server you can

00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:37,979
backdoor someone you can build a program

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:37,979
to screenshot the victims computer etc

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,919
20 server what does the server does the

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:47,409
server just binds to the interface and

00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:52,930
is the one that listens for connections

00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:55,569
and the server is basically the

00:06:52,930 --> 00:07:00,490
penetration tester or the hacker and the

00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:03,430
client is the victim so when you want to

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:06,009
back door someone you have to create a

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,960
client and for the client you have to

00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:10,900
create a server so you can listen to it

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,419
for the incoming connection and maybe

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:17,830
transfer some files execute some

00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:21,729
comments to the operating system etc so

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:26,860
some methods the server use are received

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:29,680
send listen and the step connections

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,419
which is a step

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,189
what does the candles we can just

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:39,979
connects to the server it needs this

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:42,729
connect function needs a double with a

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:45,740
host and the port the host is the server

00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:49,819
the client can receive data and send

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,289
data but the client cannot I mean the

00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:54,199
kind is not the one that starts the

00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:57,349
connection so is the server cook cook

00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:02,060
back doors in 13 dines after you cook

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:05,930
the back door in a few lines you have to

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:10,219
compile the back door for the operating

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:13,430
system if it is Mac OS X if it is

00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:15,710
windows if it is Linux it doesn't matter

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,529
you can go the back door in just a few

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:22,189
lines compile it uploading virus total

00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:24,680
that contest it for antivirus if the

00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,360
antivirus detectives then you have done

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,979
everything wrong so you have to use

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:34,940
something you have to use some creepers

00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:37,310
to create it and after using creepers

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,519
you can bind it with another program and

00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:43,459
send and spread it the best way to

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:49,449
spread this social engineering that's

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:49,449
what I think or fishing so what's next

00:08:50,260 --> 00:09:00,079
early fishing what is finishing fishing

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:04,070
is making someone believe that what he

00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:07,579
is seeing his throw like someone creates

00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:11,029
some fake website they send it to the

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:14,269
victim and the victims think that that

00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:17,329
is true but it is not also fishing is

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:22,850
just making someone thinking that it is

00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:24,860
true what he think social engineering

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:30,970
social engineering is the art of

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,970
manipulating people by using

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:47,120
a tip ideas it started in phone lines

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:52,220
but now its own computers and okay thank

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:56,450
you you can use social engineering to do

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:58,670
every kind of thing in a company social

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:01,960
engineering is easier than exploiting

00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:05,690
software because the human beings are

00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:11,240
very easy to exploit especially if they

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:14,210
don't know anything about security CET

00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:19,160
what ECT ECT is the social engineer

00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:23,060
toolkit with many cool features it has

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:26,900
nice templates it offers nice mail

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,510
attack and this option helps you to send

00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,000
a lot of emails to some employees some

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:36,350
banks sometimes financial institutions

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:47,090
and exploit them it and it's a very nice

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:50,950
way to spread back doors so dictionary

00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,950
attacks what is the dictionary attack

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,870
dictionary attack is an attack based on

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:03,530
a dictionary what is the dictionary

00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,850
dictionary is just a word this it can be

00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:12,800
a text file or another file but

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:20,810
basically a text file where this is full

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:25,840
of words that you have to try to to find

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:31,210
the user login credentials because if

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:37,760
someone creates for example a password

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:40,850
that's able and then password isn't in

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:43,880
your word list then you can

00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:49,130
crack the password would dictionary

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:51,529
attack does it is just eat tries to find

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:57,050
the right password any tries tries tries

00:11:51,529 --> 00:12:02,959
tries until there are no more any until

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:06,709
there is no more any word so Victoria

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,880
text work because people tend to use

00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:16,420
simple passwords and they use passwords

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:20,389
like a password like password 123 and

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,089
which hackers do is they take these

00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:26,410
passwords created dictionaries and they

00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:31,040
use dictionaries to dance attacks to

00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:36,440
users python makes a dictionary attack

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,620
very easy because it is as we said it is

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:42,259
high-level language with just a few

00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:46,490
lines you can build a cracker a

00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:49,300
dictionary attack and the only thing you

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:56,209
need to build a simple dictionary is the

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:58,850
open comment and inside it you put the

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,680
file name and in which mode you want to

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:05,839
open it if you want to open your hidden

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:08,319
mode or writing mode etc and I'm going

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,209
to do a UNIX password cracker demo and

00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm going to explain zip file password

00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:18,610
cracker but it's the same thing just the

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,610
only thing that changes is the diary

00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:27,390
packing hashed passwords

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:30,720
so when you store passwords you have to

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:32,880
store them in a hashed way because if

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,720
you store in plain text and the attacker

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,230
finds the plaintext then it's very easy

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,050
for him to find the password but if you

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,870
hash it then he has to crack it if he

00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:50,370
cracks then he's in if he is not he

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:55,010
doesn't crack then you are [ __ ] so the

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:59,190
crib mobile view does hashing it creeps

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:04,470
with the Crypt function and in order for

00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:07,260
this great function to work is that it

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:14,040
needs two values the password and the

00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:15,360
salt cell is two characters so we're

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:20,370
going to build it with the crack

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:23,839
function and the main function so let's

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,839
let me open a terminal

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:59,540
so i defined the shebang line and the

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:11,390
excuse me for before but I was just I

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:12,950
was not okay not now I'm okay after

00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,399
adding the say bang bang we have to

00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:18,399
import the crate module so imported

00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:25,360
after importing the creep module we have

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,360
to define a function

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:43,770
and inside this crack everybody function

00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:47,430
I have to put a parameter and i'm going

00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:51,780
to name it password because this is the

00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:58,230
when dysfunction runs i put a value on

00:15:51,780 --> 00:16:01,350
it and it cracks eat soup and as i

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:06,240
mentioned before the password when is

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:11,070
hashed with the script function it has a

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:14,580
salt which is to two characters so we

00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:24,050
have to get that salt and we're going to

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:33,270
use indexing slicing the celt equals to

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:36,660
password after getting the cell we have

00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:47,130
to open the dictionary file the word is

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:52,110
so I'm going to name it January X we use

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:58,860
the open method here i specify the

00:16:52,110 --> 00:17:01,430
filename which i have to create and put

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:07,709
it in the same folder with my script I

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:11,510
open it in Reading Mode so now I do a

00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:11,510
for loop just to read this dictionary

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:53,850
and I strip the new line from each word

00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:57,120
because we don't need that after we read

00:17:53,850 --> 00:18:01,050
each word from the dictionary with four

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,170
loop we test it if it is the same with

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:09,660
the created password but before we do

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:25,380
that we have to create our words back

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:28,460
okay okay do you right now okay now we

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:36,800
have to keep each word in the dictionary

00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:36,800
with a crypt function rip to the poor

00:18:48,850 --> 00:19:04,670
and widowed an if statement just to see

00:18:53,360 --> 00:19:09,580
if it is the same with the password if

00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:09,580
it is the same we print password found

00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:22,530
and

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:53,510
and they do an else statement print not

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:58,100
found now I have to build the main

00:19:53,510 --> 00:20:00,730
function that gonna run this function

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,730
inside

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,930
and I have to open the password file

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:22,230
which stores the best words the hushed

00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:22,230
ones

00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,049
any reading more the Gansu

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:27,770
but before I have to strip the new lines

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:05,540
so I need some hashed passwords so I

00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:05,540
have to open bite on interactive mode

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:18,320
import the Queen crypt function and I've

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:18,320
to creep something now so first word

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:34,340
and I need the self okay make it

00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,840
and then burn a story in the password is

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:21,230
now I save it okay thank you now I need

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,230
a dictionary file so

00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:34,860
and I'm going to put some random names

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,110
thanks

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,590
if

00:26:43,850 --> 00:27:04,970
so it works so cracking zip files is the

00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:09,289
same thing is the same way but you need

00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:12,470
the zip module v5 module to open zip

00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:15,320
files and zip file module has a method

00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:17,990
called extract all which extracts the

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,020
zip file but it needs a password so what

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,690
do you have to do is just try a lot of

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,059
passwords here and you can get those

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:31,220
passwords from the dictionary file so

00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:33,770
it's the same thing time is money this

00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,130
this means that you have to find a way

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:41,390
to try multiple passwords at the same

00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:45,590
time not just one password at the same

00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:48,830
time deck I did with the cracking

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:53,360
program so you have to use the threading

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:56,360
module and it's a very good module for

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:59,570
doing multiple things at the same time

00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:03,799
and it can save you a lot of time so you

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:06,770
can do another thing at the time nmap

00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:09,740
and fight on nmap is a security scanner

00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:12,559
tool it is used identify host in the

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:18,860
network it is used for operating system

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:22,280
detection and but nmap is not programmed

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:25,789
in Python it broke it is programmed in

00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:29,809
Lua but we have a library for that which

00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:34,730
is called Python and map and the

00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:40,039
question is why using by using Python

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:42,620
nmap we when we have n map because nmap

00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:45,650
edit has a lot of flags that sometimes

00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:47,600
you cannot remember them and python

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:50,870
offers you the chance to build your own

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,640
scripts and just run this script and it

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:56,510
does don't think for you so you don't

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,340
remember any flag you don't have to

00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:02,760
download and install an nmap module I

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:07,409
would just show you in a second how to

00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:13,590
use it I will do a demo a simple one but

00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:18,080
it's useful so Python nmap comes in two

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:23,519
versions for python 2.2 x + 3 point x

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:28,350
you can find it at x a l dot org norman

00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:30,899
python python nmap installation is very

00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:34,049
easy just uncompressed run pythons the

00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,240
tube the py and it's installed the

00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:38,549
animate module offers you a class called

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,370
port scanner class which has the scan

00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:45,750
thanks convex function that does don't

00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:48,750
think for you this scanned takes two

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:55,019
values the target and the port the port

00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:57,529
can be a single one or a range so let me

00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:57,529
show you

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:34,700
of course before you have to install a

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:38,330
map I have done it so and you do just

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:41,690
important map one single line after that

00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:47,320
you can use the port scanner function so

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:52,070
I'm going to do a simple scan here and

00:30:47,320 --> 00:31:02,420
assign it to a variable so i use n map

00:30:52,070 --> 00:31:05,330
and the port scanner class and now we

00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:07,790
can use functions inside port scanner

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,500
and i'm going to use the scan function

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:22,810
which we're going to do the whole thing

00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:34,340
and we need a target my localhost and

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:39,170
the board i'm going to use 53 we have to

00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:42,650
wait a few seconds and it gives you a

00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:45,740
big dictionary and now we have to

00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,080
extract information about this sport if

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:53,510
it is open filtered or closed or

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:56,560
whatever so i'm going to use this

00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,560
variable here again

00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:06,940
and I'm gonna since this is a dictionary

00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:16,399
I'm gonna extract information from me I

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:23,629
need the target I need the kind of

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:32,559
connection is a TCP connection I need of

00:32:23,629 --> 00:32:42,129
course the port which is 53 and I need

00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:42,129
the state and this s is open

00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,340
we can build a script for these just to

00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:50,979
automate all of this process and if you

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:59,559
want the nmap common for this you can do

00:32:50,979 --> 00:33:01,419
just Inlet and that comment dine and it

00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:16,929
will give you all the comments and the

00:33:01,419 --> 00:33:21,219
flags so that's all for nmap and now we

00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:22,869
move to SQL map what is SQL map SQL map

00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:25,239
is an open-source penetration

00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:29,109
penetration testing tool which is used

00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:33,609
for SQL injection detection and database

00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:39,129
takeover just download on background is

00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:44,019
in pure python some basic comments for

00:33:39,129 --> 00:33:48,249
it our Python SQL map that py just

00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:51,309
specify the URL then dash dash DBS you

00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:54,789
get the databases after we get the

00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:57,039
databases you go to tables columns after

00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:59,229
that you can extract information just

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:04,200
with dash dash down so it's very easy

00:33:59,229 --> 00:34:09,010
just to do some basic things with that

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,470
but how does SQL map passes the web

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,270
application firewalls businesses have

00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:15,789
invested a lot in web application

00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:20,079
firewalls because they think that this

00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:22,629
thing will protect them from bad guys

00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,569
but I think they are wrong because they

00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:31,510
forget the fact that they should look

00:34:24,569 --> 00:34:35,740
into the real threat they go away they

00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:37,389
go away from the real threat Oreo threat

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,119
is the vulnerability in their

00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:44,169
application of the web application

00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,419
firewall but SQL map has found it away

00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:49,029
just to fool the web application

00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:52,329
firewalls edit and it uses tamper

00:34:49,029 --> 00:34:53,870
scripts for example you have temper

00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:58,740
script like

00:34:53,870 --> 00:35:00,960
hashes space two hashes sorry know how

00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,710
to space space two hashes and this

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:10,320
script this script converts all the

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:14,190
spaces spaces into hashes so this way it

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:17,040
was the firewall and passes straight SQL

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,140
map injection is included in backtrack

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:23,340
is a very well-known tool into

00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:29,250
penetration testing area and I used it

00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:33,060
so I suggest you to use it SQL map does

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:37,500
user information it dumps all the data

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:42,210
from the database and after you get the

00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:45,570
hashes of the password you can use the

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,670
SQL map cracker it offers dictionary

00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:53,310
attack and brute force attack which you

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:55,590
can use to crack these hashes so this

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:59,130
all for my presentation I know my

00:35:55,590 --> 00:36:02,340
English was a bit because I know was not

00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,290
feeling very good I'm a bit more good

00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:07,820
now right now but not very good so I

00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:07,820
want to thank you for coming here

00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:41,140
any questions other I have a question

00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:46,370
believe that as human beings were just

00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:51,440
uh this this human flesh of ours or we

00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:53,800
more than that I think we are more than

00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,800
that

00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:12,540
I think we are spirit yes this is what

00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,520
they think hey thanks for really good

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,260
talk and just quick question do you

00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,790
could you recommend any servers that are

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,590
set up as like honey nets that you can

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:24,450
actually practice on cracking on that

00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:26,310
kind of thing what can you a PM do you

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,020
have any servers that you know that are

00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:29,550
set up is practice servers like honey

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,170
naps or that kind of thing where it's

00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:35,720
you know kind of a good place to start

00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:38,720
practicing on oh I don't use that okay

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,720
thanks

00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,790
Oh

00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,220
I use the SCAP in the past and it's

00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,350
really amazing I think but what does

00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:17,830
Python a map would do more than this

00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:27,310
keppi can do ready not much any more

00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:30,010
questions I'm just interested in what

00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:31,720
you use this stuff for it look so are

00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,490
you trying to crack people's password

00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,740
and then I don't take profit from that

00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:39,970
or more like from a service side for

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:44,800
four companies for security no I'm just

00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:49,440
I do this for fun not know any profit

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:53,020
just computer geek just just for that

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,480
but this is a beginner top is where I

00:38:53,020 --> 00:39:04,840
introduce so basic tools because this is

00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:06,940
basic it's not advanced things and you

00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,250
said the sequel map has like a commando

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:11,200
just go sequel map databases when you

00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:13,420
give it a server and not just what that

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,020
magically lists all the databases are

00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,160
running on that server well and that's a

00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,840
question like does that actually happen

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,400
is it just you type in sequel map

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,800
databases server and then it just

00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,360
magically finds out all the databases

00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,320
running on that server how does it work

00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:31,240
I don't know how does magic okay and

00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,820
then you can use just blend in my I

00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,070
didn't program the toilet I used it yeah

00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,200
yeah no I know so and it's just one

00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:39,850
command to try all of the possible

00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:49,500
sequel injection attacks against at home

00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:49,500
now okay several oh cool anybody else

00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,500
okay so thank you very much

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,910
