party somehow it usually works like this

00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:16,139
everybody should have somehow in his

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:18,090
purse some papers like this and what you

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,029
should have written on the papers maybe

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,119
your name your email address your key ID

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,300
and your fingerprint or the fingerprint

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,679
of the key and then you can just give it

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,660
to someone show your passport look each

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,850
other into the face and check if

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,680
everything is ok if the name matches if

00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,899
the guy really looks like in the

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,320
passport or more or less like in the

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:46,410
passport and then the recipient of that

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,570
paper can maybe just do a manual

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,410
signature here and put it in his pocket

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:55,079
and later at home he can sign that key

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,640
he just outlets it from the keys are or

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,190
signs it and if he found it on the keys

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,860
we can just upload it again to the key

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,920
server if the key is not found on any

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,070
key server you maybe have to ask the guy

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,960
in send me your public key then you sign

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,520
it and then you send a signed worsen

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,290
back so this is how it would work and

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,159
the only thing that has to be done in

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,650
person is somehow this checking all

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,920
every every else stuff good can be done

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,430
at home basically so this was mainly

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,049
intended to be about this checking part

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:45,110
checking the passport and if the guy is

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:48,799
real do you have any document with you

00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:48,799
then you have to get it

00:01:50,300 --> 00:02:02,110
this information yeah you can also have

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:05,180
a visiting card a visit carved here and

00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:07,040
business cards here and print it on it

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,010
but I have gone the cheap way and just

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,650
use some paper and cut it you can also

00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,900
if you did not do this before you can

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,990
also use a piece of paper now and just

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:21,710
ride the values on it just the

00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:28,970
fingerprint is a bit long yeah but you

00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:32,420
could do it that way also okay who is

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:35,420
completely new to GP cheese stuff who

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:39,170
does not know how it works at all okay

00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:43,420
to so i can tell something about it

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:47,260
maybe while the rest is exchanging keys

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:54,020
you are not speaking German right okay

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:57,700
so so no not how it for sure not I had

00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:06,260
it at school but it's rather outdated

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:11,540
from how my screen has changed yeah that

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:14,470
also but I have to so 0 and 1 is not

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,470
present okay

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:33,260
this is a tall guy held in Germany and

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,990
it's not going in very deep but it's

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,680
covering the most basic stuff you need

00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,680
in any case

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:55,280
oh yeah you could plug it in yeah thanks

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:03,629
okay one of the more complicated things

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:08,640
about using open PG stuff inside Agnew

00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:10,980
PG or PG p on windows for example at the

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,489
beginning you have to create a key pair

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,650
it's a pair of a public key and a

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:18,600
private key to private key you keep for

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,060
yourself and its secret and don't give

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,979
it to anyone and the public here you can

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,800
give to everybody you can even upload it

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:29,520
to an public key server on the internet

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,950
or appended to a male somehow and at the

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,950
beginning you need to make a key pair

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:50,580
this is somehow badly aligned can we can

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:53,010
we change this um oh sorry just seemed

00:04:50,580 --> 00:05:00,410
disused to work automatically in the

00:04:53,010 --> 00:05:00,410
past okay okay

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,630
acknowledge the correct one

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:35,289
okay I'll go one people even with this

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:39,400
one yeah but these are should work

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:42,610
better and I had talks you it worked

00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:49,240
into other rooms somehow sorry things

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:51,930
and no I ok i just think i moved to

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,930
window a

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:12,750
so this shit's ok so now it fits small s

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:15,419
so you need to use gpg you have linux or

00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:19,289
what do you have ok you need to install

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:21,270
a new PG maybe the version one I think

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:24,690
this is covering the one version and

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:30,090
then you just say generate te 0 minus

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:33,659
minus gen- key and you should do this on

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:36,720
a rod of trusted machine so you

00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:42,479
shouldn't have any suspicious activity

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:45,599
on your machine yeah so maybe don't do

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,099
it on infected windows machine because

00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:51,659
it might know your passphrase afterwards

00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:55,169
it will ask you some questions

00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:59,940
afterwards and these are just the

00:06:55,169 --> 00:07:04,949
answers 5 and 4096 and then use maybe

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:09,030
and name and email address this 5 tells

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:11,550
you want to use RSA encryption the main

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,849
reason for this is that DSA might be

00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:19,409
still limited to 1024 bits and you'll

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:22,919
likely want more so use RSA and this is

00:07:19,409 --> 00:07:26,250
a rather big key length for your master

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:30,229
key the master key is that key that will

00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:33,060
have a really long lifetime 10 years and

00:07:30,229 --> 00:07:36,630
it won't be the key you will actively

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,729
use for signing and encrypting stuff but

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:41,490
it's rather the key that is used to

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:45,449
protect the other keys or that other

00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:50,580
other people can sign so you keep the

00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:54,389
signatures for 10 years basically so

00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,849
these are the parameters it will ask you

00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,919
for a comment you can write something in

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:02,909
there or you can also keep keep the

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:06,560
comment empty and at the end you have to

00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:08,550
say okay then you might get some

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,490
notification that it does not have

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,639
enough random bytes or something then

00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,300
just move your mouse

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:21,719
I was hit some keys or something so it

00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:21,719
gets more randomness into the system and

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:34,360
then it will tell something like this

00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:37,510
and you see it has 4069 pits and this is

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,240
the key ID and you see this was a while

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,789
ago when I did it and it will expire ten

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,370
years later and it will also tell you

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:48,760
the fingerprint this is what you want to

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,860
put on your business card so people can

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:53,560
verify if they downloaded your key from

00:08:50,860 --> 00:09:09,130
a key server whether it's really the

00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:11,459
right one yeah yeah it's a bit it's a

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,459
bit difficult

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,510
excuse me what

00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:33,160
because the checking of the past part

00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:36,410
you can only do that in person so well

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,899
maybe do you think you could look this

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,779
up on the Internet somehow because there

00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:45,350
are somehow tools and if you remember

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:48,499
that URL you can maybe even read those

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:52,339
tips or those command lines even if the

00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:54,790
rest is in German and there is also a

00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:59,989
script of another guy that automates

00:09:54,790 --> 00:10:04,670
most of this so you maybe have the

00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:06,709
answers may be rubbish or you will

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,439
create a master key and you will create

00:10:06,709 --> 00:10:15,350
two subkeys one for signing one for

00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:18,199
encryption and also important you will

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:21,040
have to generate revocation certificates

00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:26,149
so in case you forget your passphrase

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,819
you can revoke those keys otherwise you

00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:31,240
can't pull them back from the key server

00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:37,549
because you can't identify yourself

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:40,399
basically then upload the key if you're

00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:44,389
sure you did everything wrong print your

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,420
business cards and take part in such

00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:50,299
meetings and get your keys signed by

00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:56,660
many other people so there is a network

00:10:50,299 --> 00:10:59,899
of trust that develops two words about

00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:03,499
mistakes you could make because this is

00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:05,480
also important don't use a to e zpass

00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:07,490
race this is the only thing that

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,649
protects your key if you lose it or if

00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,649
it gets stolen somehow in on your laptop

00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:18,470
don't enter your passphrase if some

00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,489
camera is looking on you of course it

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:26,649
must not get disclosed don't create a

00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:30,259
key pair on a not trustworthy machine

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:35,360
don't forget your passphrase make a

00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:38,499
backup make revocation certificates also

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,109
this expiry date is in power

00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:44,229
if you set it to infinity it will never

00:11:41,109 --> 00:11:46,269
expire and this is a spare especially

00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:48,579
bad if you also don't have revocation

00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:55,259
certificates because it will never go

00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:58,119
away again and don't use a too-short key

00:11:55,259 --> 00:12:00,369
768 bits or something is not enough

00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:04,529
anymore you'd need at least two thousand

00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:08,079
I think so two thousand or 4,000 and

00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:10,689
especially do not sign anything you want

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:15,579
to deny later because you signed it

00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:17,999
digitally you cannot deny it later okay

00:12:15,579 --> 00:12:21,549
these are the most common arrows maybe

00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:25,839
one additional thing if you want even be

00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:29,049
more secure you should create the master

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,389
key maybe on a flying machine and never

00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,219
use the master key on a machine that is

00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,009
somehow online are connected or

00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:40,469
something that would be even a bit more

00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:43,239
secure but this is the most common stuff

00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:47,109
okay so let's use the rest of the time

00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:56,619
for key signing and it works like this

00:12:47,109 --> 00:13:02,619
you risked my prospers up so you use

00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:04,569
your passport or your identity card if

00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:10,539
you have nothing else maybe your driving

00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:18,249
licence or something yeah that's not

00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:21,119
very official yeah and then you just

00:13:18,249 --> 00:13:21,119
give it to someone

00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:28,290
yeah no problem you don't need a

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:34,220
notebook you look at the photo you look

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:37,410
at me the guy can take down my glasses

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,990
and it should match somehow of course if

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:41,850
that picture is five years ago or

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,200
something it will have maybe some

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:49,680
differences you check the name of course

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:52,170
you check the name here and okay email

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,830
address and the rest is from me anyway

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:58,710
and now you could take the pencil you

00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:01,350
can the pencil and maybe use just sign

00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:03,660
with your name here so you have signed

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,450
it on paper and you will remember later

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,970
that you checked all that stuff and you

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:12,630
just take it home with you and do the

00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:16,680
rest at home doing it at home by the way

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:18,029
it has the advantage if you would do it

00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,339
here you would have to enter your

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:22,350
passphrase and at least three people

00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,380
from behind you would maybe see your

00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:29,640
passphrase so doing it at home is better

00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:35,160
anyway okay and we could do that sort of

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:39,120
stuff you know combinations now just

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:42,050
make sure to get back your passport you

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,050
might need it soon

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,020
so you want to take part

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:11,699
if there are questions in between just

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:14,519
asked by the way if you want to use this

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:17,430
practically later for example if you use

00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,790
Thunderbird there is an extension called

00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:24,829
a Nik mail like enigma and mail enik

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,829
mail and that makes it

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,700
you

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:53,460
arneson over us they say that they don't

00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:58,950
know that because it's encrypted so they

00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:06,260
can do they can what they can try they

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:09,540
can try four thousand years likely yeah

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:11,820
by the way what I heard until now and

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:13,710
what I think most security people are

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:18,090
saying that is that p-gp is rather

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:20,720
secure so if it would happen that in one

00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:24,830
year something is somebody is saying

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:29,670
don't use PGP anymore it is not secure

00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:32,130
then check if that guy's really telling

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:41,670
the truth or maybe lying at you just to

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:44,010
want you to get it away from it he would

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,850
have to prove that with encrypted text

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:54,990
basically and maybe with some cryptic

00:16:46,850 --> 00:17:00,110
cryptographers watching him also so do

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:05,070
we want to sign it you know how it works

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:07,980
you check the photo look here yeah okay

00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:12,060
then check the name is the same on the

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,830
paper and then maybe make some michael

00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:18,300
some sign so that you really remember i

00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:20,730
have checked this guy and later at home

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,860
you can download my key you have the key

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,240
ID here on the paper you can get it from

00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,860
the key server yeah you sign on p paper

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,520
now just to remember that you really

00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:34,380
check this this is the only thing if you

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,720
only put stuff in your pocket that you

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:40,520
have checked you don't even need to sign

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,520
it but you have to remember what you did

00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:51,630
we noted our questions asked yep I never

00:17:49,140 --> 00:18:06,750
used for some emails I just didn't sign

00:17:51,630 --> 00:18:12,240
my to use Thunderbolt maybe yes I hope

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:15,120
yours anyway yep here you can you can

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,130
the public keys on the key server so you

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:25,020
can basically get any public key you

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:28,050
want you can just google for key sir but

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:31,530
there is one at the MIT I think and one

00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:35,160
is at keys that new peachy dot org or

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,440
something it's the same they exchange

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,350
the keys you can use whatever works for

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,680
you and if you check the fingerprint of

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:46,950
the key you can't fake it somehow so

00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:48,510
it's really the key you want important

00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,910
is to check if the fingerprint of the

00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:59,090
key you sign if you are ready with the

00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:59,090
passport okay

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:23,390
you can encrypt the file itself if you

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,660
want to encrypt some text you can use it

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:30,470
on the command line and then just idle

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:33,620
type in the text or use a pipe and and

00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:36,170
push it into this tool and as soon as

00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:40,670
the end of file is reached it will

00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:44,360
output the encrypted stuff and it will

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:47,570
encrypt for this recipient so you need

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:50,540
to have downloaded a public key with

00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:54,890
receive keys and the output will be the

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,960
encrypted stuff and it will be in some

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,470
sort of text format this is this armor

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:06,100
parameter so you it's a 7-bit safe

00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:08,720
somehow and if you want to sign

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,630
decrypting works the same way you can

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,960
just say decrypt and input such a file

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:17,330
into standard input then of course you

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,610
need a passphrase and then it will

00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:25,360
output the decrypted text here and I

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:33,190
have it back off this one to keep this

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:38,780
okay so can I paper yeah it's for you

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:42,770
okay this matches won second place lenok

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:47,690
not here should matches too okay that's

00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:55,450
fine okay so I need do you have

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:55,450
something to write sign it here now oops

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:02,200
okay and put it in the pocket for now

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:15,860
okay who is not easy the other

00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:18,369
application of if you don't want to

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,470
encrypt but if you make one to make sure

00:21:18,369 --> 00:21:24,889
that nobody modifies your data you can

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:27,679
also sign stuff works like this you say

00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:31,580
I want to sign this armors if you want

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:34,639
to transmit it in via email or so a

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,230
clear sign means the text is still

00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:39,830
readable there is just something

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:43,009
additional below it and then you input

00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:47,720
the input data and it will get into here

00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:51,200
as output and if you if you want to

00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,330
check such assigned content you can just

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:58,730
say verify and it will say good

00:21:53,330 --> 00:22:02,919
signature so that's basically it by the

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:07,669
way I think here you might get a message

00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:10,940
that there is a good signature but that

00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:13,190
you don't trust this key this is because

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,309
it's maybe not part of your trust

00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:21,740
network but it still has verified if

00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:23,809
it's the correct key so yeah you can

00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:27,519
ignore that part of the message the good

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,519
signature here is important

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:38,320
well there is also for evolution of

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:42,429
extent evolution has built in GPT

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,260
support enigmatic for thunderbird there

00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:49,720
is fire Chi peachy for firefox I think

00:22:46,260 --> 00:23:03,160
and yeah this isn't the rest assured

00:22:49,720 --> 00:23:07,480
German that's not that interesting okay

00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:17,830
so basically you can do exchange your

00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:19,660
stuff with everybody else with your

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,660
public keys and then send it back to you

00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:25,720
and then I got you in my case i have

00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:27,840
uploaded my key to the key server and if

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,850
that is the case if the original perv

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:34,330
uploaded his own key to the key server

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:36,130
you can do the same i think nobody will

00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:38,380
have a problem with that just if you

00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:40,600
don't find the key on the key server and

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,880
you get it somewhere else by email

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,799
personally also then don't upload it to

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:48,190
the key sir but then maybe that guy does

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,049
not want it to be on the key server but

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:57,940
mine is on the key server so you can

00:23:50,049 --> 00:24:01,419
just upload it again maybe someone

00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:05,730
thinks it's less secure so but I don't

00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:05,730
know I I don't have a reason to do that

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:21,500
the same time and you I think the key

00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,480
service somehow deal with that but I

00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:40,220
don't know the technical details how

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:41,929
they match it but it seems to work by

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:52,640
the way those key servers also have a

00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:56,690
web interface gpg key so more so you see

00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:01,160
it as pgp MIT I do this is the may be

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:04,100
the oldest original one and if you go

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:08,900
there you can search for a string so I

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:14,570
just use my last name or you also could

00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:16,340
end your email address hit Search and of

00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,169
course then you need to be careful you

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,679
see there are quite a lot of people with

00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:25,340
my last name so you have to choose the

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,380
right key and okay the email address is

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,530
more it's maybe better you see here is

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:33,980
my correct email address then you can

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:37,210
say see here this is the key ID and it's

00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:41,990
the same like on my paper so this is the

00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:43,910
this is the right key now and you also

00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:51,440
see here the length and that it is our

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:55,450
essay and if you click here you get it

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,450
in text format this is my public key

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:11,640
by the way afterwards is it there's from

00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:14,340
haga this talk and we are thinking about

00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:16,280
how to maybe improve that that's all of

00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:19,500
stuff that it gets less complicated

00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:21,870
because currently is not dead widely

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,750
used it should be more widely used to be

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,620
really useful and there is an idea how

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:31,260
to make it easier it's maybe not

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,940
extremely hundred percent perfect but it

00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,920
would be better than the current state

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,980
occurrence dated everybody does not

00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:41,090
encrypt this email so it would be better

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,090
than that at least

00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:49,370
that

00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:00,530
he's hiding or like sessions are you

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:16,520
coming for key signing off for the next

00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:23,860
recession I tried to find the other key

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:23,860
server new PG that's the linux stuff

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:46,240
they synchronize somehow this is keep

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:48,770
signing yeah I just keep updated from

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,740
all services the thing is that every

00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:57,170
participant a different copies of the

00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:59,480
key with over speakers yeah yeah Mitch

00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,370
get where you want to write I mean the

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,510
right one is written here this is the

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:09,500
key ID there is a beat 3d or five yeah I

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:12,080
see the one is the primary key I think

00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,510
this is one that I have written here and

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,270
the other one is a secondary key so that

00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:19,010
just tell me this ok so you have one is

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,870
the primary you have to sign that one

00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:24,410
that is printed here no no he's asking

00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:27,260
about TG about history oops sorry so

00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:31,760
tell me this this combination does after

00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:35,030
/ the walk is the pattern right so this

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:42,070
is called active Emery supervisor and

00:28:35,030 --> 00:29:07,930
without 691 yeah yeah looks like

00:28:42,070 --> 00:29:10,360
but that it says SS strange yeah they

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,900
wouldn't alone and you destroy them they

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,120
allow yeah that's the best way guys

00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,950
because over the Internet give always

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,860
slight chance that there are some

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:24,630
someone in the middle and you also can

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:27,340
can check faces over the Internet I

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:29,890
don't make everybody else woman

00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:32,590
everybody else here can ponder whether I

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:34,810
trust you're not pretend I was you yeah

00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:37,360
that's the problem and this is why you

00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:39,910
get my passport you see my face here and

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,320
you get this for me personally this is

00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:49,380
the way to check it that you have the

00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:49,380
right one yeah check check the passport

00:29:51,180 --> 00:30:01,210
you think best like this main

00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:04,860
richmond-based MC not a question of the

00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,860
thing that I do is move the second

00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:23,180
Fausto's maximum when we still in orbit

00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:24,740
sorry a couple of yeah you could reach

00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,220
and they might someone just like when

00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:36,110
you see you know when you're done

00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:39,940
whatever you consider is okay yeah I you

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,940
I how much time do we have left

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:54,950
questions okay okay with me so this is

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:58,190
the formulas which I just want to be

00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:03,200
easier than trying us capture pineys so

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:22,790
you can okay oh wait you spell it to be

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:29,240
honest nice combination Nate I was

00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:31,850
knocked in Isis yeah the relative

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,000
validity of the passport strictly has to

00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:38,800
be checked so if it's not valid anymore

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:44,890
yeah maybe have some sort of Tolerance

00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,890
about this okay

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:58,080
we have a paper with your stuff I forget

00:31:48,940 --> 00:32:02,139
one so also you only have one copy yeah

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:10,179
okay an alternative approach is if you

00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:12,190
have a digital camera with you maybe

00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:18,480
could also just take a photo of the

00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:18,480
stuff then you have to write less

00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:44,290
okay any more questions by the way if

00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,930
you develop some software you can sign

00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:49,720
your software releases so if you have a

00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:52,540
top G set or zip file or something you

00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,420
can sign that file and then you can

00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:57,160
verify later if someone tampered that

00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,860
file and all the people who downloaded

00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,710
from you can check if it really is the

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:08,860
content that it should be and it really

00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:12,430
you signed it comments yeah if you use

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:15,850
get you can sign your get comments so

00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:18,160
it's quite useful especially if at some

00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:20,650
time someone breaks into your server and

00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:27,220
you can be sure that your zip file is

00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:29,620
exactly how it was before can can can I

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:31,590
sign your can you send mine yeah I don't

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:35,530
have it here so I have to tell you

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:46,780
alright alright it down can you show it

00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:48,910
to me in a big picture somehow because I

00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:56,160
don't want to write down a lot of stuff

00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:56,160
right now Hawking just the right one

00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:27,210
okay yeah oh really work ok so the

00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:31,109
passports look a bit different now so

00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:34,050
your field is different okay yeah my ids

00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:40,050
universe yeah from when what is it was

00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:44,669
this this is 2009 or okay / left wait a

00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:49,710
minute that's the taught in your hell

00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:52,470
was a bit darker and I can show you my

00:34:49,710 --> 00:35:02,069
ideas well if you want let's look at

00:34:52,470 --> 00:35:08,210
this yeah okay okay now I ball the case

00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:08,210
i think yeah this is my passport

00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:22,410
last name okay okay okay that's you no

00:35:20,309 --> 00:35:24,479
doubt about that so that's it right then

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:27,989
I send you the doors your keys and with

00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:30,209
mine you can just upload it download it

00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:38,039
from he saw will sign it upload it again

00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:39,690
ok ok that sending is not not necessary

00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,029
anymore right if I upload can upload it

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:46,229
that's like sending I can download it

00:35:42,029 --> 00:35:48,479
from there so yeah just don't upload the

00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:51,059
key from someone you did not find on a

00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:56,489
key server because maybe that guy

00:35:51,059 --> 00:36:02,549
doesn't like it does something ok ok

00:35:56,489 --> 00:36:04,759
last questions any ok seems not to be

00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:04,759
the case

00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,620
