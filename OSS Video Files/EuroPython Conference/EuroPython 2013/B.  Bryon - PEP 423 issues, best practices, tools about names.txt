alright welcome back and to the next

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,000
speaker you're going to speak about pep

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,470
right yes okay so I guess you will want

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,880
to say more tell me about it hi I'm

00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:33,270
banario last year I submitted the paper

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:37,250
for 23 which is about names in packaging

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:40,350
must be names in involved projects and

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,910
packages distributed within projects

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:49,649
that are published on pi PI but also

00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:54,270
private projects the the feeling way

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:57,750
when I started this pep was names on phi

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:03,049
p i were we're a mess because there are

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:06,960
so many different patterns so i try to

00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:14,130
to collect best practices from the

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:21,450
community and see if there if we put get

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:31,409
conventions so last year the wool heard

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:37,950
about a suspect nobody so i guess i have

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:43,229
to explain a bit as a pack you will see

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,899
the light in tokai we present later in

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:50,520
the afternoon I I was planning to

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:56,340
present it on women's wednesday but it's

00:01:50,520 --> 00:02:01,020
today the fact is there are issues with

00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:03,990
an naming on pi PI as an example there

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,700
are crushes an example is a piece of

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,850
Python file and jungles and five

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,700
projects was this tribute

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:13,150
Sen fight package so you the issue is

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,650
that you cannot install boss in an

00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,040
environment you can actually install

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:22,280
boss but you can only use one because

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,319
there was a Python pass only finds the

00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:30,860
first and there are many Android in

00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:34,550
nymph named species on pypy I said

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:40,220
seedot arrestee tool is an example many

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:44,780
users don't discard this project because

00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:50,269
they fix I think it's a specific tools

00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:53,720
LC which is a sub corporation and but

00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:58,660
it's a generic project it's a related to

00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:03,440
da cuties so let's see here in the name

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:09,040
makes more noise than it's not helpful

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:14,329
for beginners we don't know this project

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:18,769
so there are issues like that and the

00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:23,060
idea is to correct if you if you know

00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:27,109
about some issues just tell me so that

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:31,310
we can add them to the PAP and see if

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:35,420
the pep answers those issues as the pep

00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:38,840
proposes some solutions as an example to

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,810
use a single name as a convention it

00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:45,410
means that you pip install sorry this is

00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:48,620
a project name so you import theory

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:52,220
which is the package name it's a quite

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:57,820
simple and it resolves most of many

00:03:52,220 --> 00:04:01,660
issues also to throw up at eight many

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:07,549
project names don't follow pep eight

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:10,549
also to use a single namespace let's see

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:12,790
that RS t two is using an established

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:16,750
name spaces and

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:21,960
namespaces aren't related between each

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:26,259
other it produces confusions and

00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:29,139
sometimes people want to use names on

00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:32,919
the whole name spaces for category

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:36,400
categorization and that not the goal of

00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:40,570
the name if you want to use categories

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,600
you can use metadata such as classifiers

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:49,509
or keywords so so the name of that

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:53,650
should be should remain simple and the

00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:57,340
pep states that the new project should

00:04:53,650 --> 00:05:01,720
follow pepperflow 23 that's it's quite

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:06,880
easy to do too bright but existing

00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:10,180
projects can be so what cam is important

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:14,169
they don't have to they can win be

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,349
renamed and the back propose recipe to

00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:20,789
depict to register a new project with a

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:25,210
new name and duplicate the old project

00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:31,150
there is a recipe existed but it's not

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:35,229
very well known and if you the easiest

00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:38,169
way to to be pep 423 compliant is to

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:42,880
state about your your naming conventions

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:48,729
if you do not follow paid for 23

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:56,889
conventions it's okay if you are

00:05:48,729 --> 00:06:00,780
document it until I and the main use

00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:06,669
case is for big projects like jungle

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:10,659
where community uses a pattern which is

00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:15,070
a jungle dash name of the project and we

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:17,260
import name of the project like jungle

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,520
dash ten file and import

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,840
and five it is a prognosis issues like

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:30,910
with jungle dash ten five and jungle

00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:34,630
pipeline for example and at least the

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:39,460
the paper tears at least jungle project

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:44,980
should make the this convention obvious

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:47,620
by documenting it but so the pipe is a

00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:51,790
draft and we are here to discuss about

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:57,010
it and and see if the ideas are what do

00:06:51,790 --> 00:07:00,520
you think about it so do you have

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:05,760
questions some points we are not that

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:05,760
are not clear to your feedback

00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:21,449
okay so if there is no namespace does

00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:23,879
that mean that's the category like your

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:29,159
jungle dash should be set in some other

00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:31,679
place it could be of course existing

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:34,349
project don't have to so existing

00:07:31,679 --> 00:07:40,159
conventions like there are many jungle

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:44,849
dash singing projects so we cut order

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:48,119
also to me great in fact they say want

00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,779
me great or maybe it perhaps if the

00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:56,339
jungle project tells everyone to me wait

00:07:51,779 --> 00:08:02,209
but I don't think it would open the main

00:07:56,339 --> 00:08:08,789
idea is that the jungle dash could be

00:08:02,209 --> 00:08:11,849
set in a setup py file with meta data

00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:17,069
because there is a classifier jungle

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:20,399
jungle framework and this is enough the

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:23,219
project to fit on on ipi and find all

00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:26,639
projects we are really good to jungle

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:30,539
and sometimes we could have a project

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:34,949
which is related to jungle and and you

00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:39,990
cannot name it after st. country got

00:08:34,949 --> 00:08:44,610
something and the dash something can the

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:50,699
Taylor sings country dash jungle dashes

00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:53,939
and it's ridiculous and made metadata is

00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:57,800
enough to describe the categories and

00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:57,800
slow so a project like

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:10,130
plundered app docked something or TV dr.

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:14,280
generic dot web be web builder is enough

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:16,350
at some point those ideas of the last

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:21,830
year when I proposed the tab I first

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:27,390
proposed a solution where there was an

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:32,910
English ownership top namespace let's

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:37,650
say something like do not we r dot my

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:42,170
project and so that we don't kiss

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:47,040
because everyone have its own namespace

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:52,470
but it was a very disk used and it

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:56,370
didn't get consensus so and he many

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:58,320
people told me you should two things

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:05,370
flat because flight is let us unmolested

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:10,920
and things will be simple so there is a

00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:20,460
date I send it today that he was not

00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:25,670
finished yet this G sub data tells you

00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:25,670
should use a single namespace a flat

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,310
hour to dissolve like some days

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:40,220
you I see a problem there with a single

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,330
namespace is that somebody has a package

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:45,500
out there that does something even to

00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,600
improve on that you cannot find the

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,160
altar he doesn't respond it takes a

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,020
while and pi PI I don't know if you ever

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,770
tried it before you can like actually

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:59,030
kick some of the oven of a pack and then

00:10:53,770 --> 00:11:03,080
we capture the auto ship gets there I

00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:04,970
did it twice and it takes two while and

00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,920
if you just want to publish like an

00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,510
improved for a complete different

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,700
version that tackles the same problem

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:14,650
how would you do the name like very

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:21,200
practical I'm looking at the WM control

00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:23,600
package and it's it doesn't work do I go

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,720
on and try to find the order or my own

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,630
stuff that does work in my space which

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,220
is what I was intending to do how would

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,710
you solve that if you have a single

00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:37,880
namespace because there is no simple

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:44,510
sort of i understood or the discussions

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:47,750
is that the PI P I is a reference it's

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:51,320
it's a place to register fond of all

00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:57,500
names you while your name went register

00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:01,220
on Phi P I you eat can't exist so yes

00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:04,430
when there is a project you don't like

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:10,330
all which is inactive status case yeah

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:13,310
and you want to to contribute to it but

00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:17,150
there is two solutions so the first one

00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:20,360
is to contact the author of the this

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:23,100
project and try to contribute if you

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,730
can't because a

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:31,650
so tall doesn't answer you handle

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:35,740
requests the only solution i see is to

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:39,490
to create a new one but not in an

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:42,490
attorney has another neck with an under

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,830
the name then if you do that then

00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,130
there's no relationship not necessarily

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:50,670
between the name and your and your

00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:55,860
package like one of the things that I

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:59,230
hijacked or are used was Bill wsgi and

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:02,590
so it was not possible to update that

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:05,170
pay that reference in there I was not

00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,910
malicious but the guy was just not found

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,810
and it takes a while before you get if

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:15,670
you if the if the person who put and

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,860
used the name before just wants to go on

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,410
with that and doesn't want you two to

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,290
merge your your proposed source code

00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:26,380
changes then the only option you would

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,840
have is use a different name but if you

00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:32,170
don't pop names there's very little you

00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:34,270
can say like oh there's now a directly

00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:36,910
relationship between the last part after

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:41,620
dot and the package that you will be

00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:43,870
installing and I don't see like what do

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,560
you want then to like put a tube behind

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:52,180
it or like just take up a bogus name or

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:55,690
or take a you you ID and then even what

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:58,330
you want she wants a as it package user

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:00,010
and as a package maker you want to have

00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:04,000
a relationship between the name you have

00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:07,350
up there on the f pi and because we

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,630
budget so not sure to understand

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:14,020
sometimes I don't unnecessary so you can

00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:18,250
can you take an example you saw you want

00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:21,220
to create a project too comfortable as

00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:27,040
to another project like no no I want my

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:29,950
I if if I would have make a project WM

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:35,170
control which is a wrapper around the WM

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:38,829
control utility online ex and I I cannot

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:41,230
we've original author of the current WM

00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:43,810
control package there what should i do

00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:47,440
because i want to have some some way

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:49,149
that the name that i use of gates what

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,459
the package does I don't want just have

00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:56,019
a random name and till you make the

00:14:51,459 --> 00:15:06,699
namespace the more taken and then don't

00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:09,130
get any anything useful yeah essentially

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:13,560
some some way of honor namespace and for

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:18,730
me that it says is that C dot before it

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:21,699
even in the case of sort of that I know

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:25,209
okay I like the others said C so I'll

00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:28,060
get this one as well or pi dot beer from

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:31,930
Hokkaido it's like okay of course you

00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:34,660
you don't reach namespace but if someone

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,290
goes in there it's like hey why you do

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:41,019
that but if it's flat somebody just

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:42,130
takes it and it it might be what is what

00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:46,490
is getting there are some of these

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:54,170
packages you three blades

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:56,360
i also have an issue with flats but i

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,790
also have an issue with owner the issue

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,950
with RNA is I know there's several

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:04,070
having the same name first name and last

00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,190
name so that could be an issue if you

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,230
put it flat how do how do you deal with

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:13,430
for example send file for jungle and

00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:16,520
sinful for web 2 pi because when you

00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,820
want two people and styles and you can't

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,700
specify the metadata or say i want to

00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,770
send file for jungle the same fight for

00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,339
can you do something like that yes

00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:32,420
because you actually can use name

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:37,520
species but the point is when you use

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:41,330
nexus you should make make sure the name

00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,880
spaces are have strong relationships if

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,870
you do a package specific to jungle you

00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:51,800
could have jungle contrib or something

00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:57,500
some namespace proposed by the jungle

00:16:51,800 --> 00:17:03,200
project like a strange country or flasks

00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:07,870
flasks it was it it has read he has a

00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:11,360
flask dot X dot something namespace and

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:14,420
the recommendation of the fat project is

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:21,800
that contributions to go in that

00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:24,380
namespace so the project could have used

00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:29,450
username space if they are specific to

00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:33,950
something I talked to talk about private

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:38,240
projects when projects are processes it

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:43,550
could be your company that something

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:47,630
could be a projecting on Disney but you

00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:50,870
just often so the concept is to have to

00:17:47,630 --> 00:18:01,309
make sure such this project specific to

00:17:50,870 --> 00:18:07,190
so the top-level namespace not we have

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:11,180
flat it is the IDS to be flat for most

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:15,670
things except when you have when you

00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:18,980
need namespaces or you explicitly want

00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:23,809
passion ships between these places like

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:29,770
flag flask text something projects we

00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:37,400
which register in this namespace are

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:40,760
basically the authorization to to to use

00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:50,750
the flask namespace and they are de

00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:52,620
facto related to two flasks anywhere

00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,500
else

00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:59,110
i would like to remind you i think it's

00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,480
part of a PI from sin but names places a

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,120
honking good idea and should be more of

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,540
those so I think it's quite obvious but

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,760
we should have namespaces it's just what

00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:13,480
we normally what we do have a flat names

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,000
and quite surprised but I also don't

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,190
like the owner thing but how with github

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,530
and these kind of things where they have

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:24,460
a very frequent I think it's a good

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:31,020
solution to just prefix some rap name

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:34,090
and get used to her what about

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:37,750
maintaining the name space outside the

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:42,790
name of the package in the metadata is

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:46,030
it possible to break it's the pappy

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,400
tries to be a bit consistent so if you

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:52,090
use a single namespace a single name

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,990
it's using the same name for project and

00:19:52,090 --> 00:20:01,600
package you can say use a thousand the

00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:08,260
namespace in the meta data so turns out

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:11,500
with github tues ownership that yes it I

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:15,520
proposed the first proposition proposal

00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:18,880
that to 12 ownership or something dash

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:24,850
stones from Winston jet two levels and

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:27,180
mostly for most in most cases only two

00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:27,180
levels

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:36,380
it many many people complain about it

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:40,010
because I like flag sings the about

00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:44,510
namespaces one thing is since clear is

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:49,460
that people don't want to have deep an

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:55,220
established a sweet one ok too ok

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:58,280
perhaps three they say begin to is a two

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:01,450
thousand one more than three nobody

00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:09,800
wants it I got a motion in transfer I

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:13,490
received one or two so the new proposal

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:21,470
is problem I propose one because of the

00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:26,060
zones where I got we see if I guess some

00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:32,170
people will after the same reactions and

00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:32,170
you until why only one because it

00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:45,070
clashes are easier and so so why not

00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:45,070
true I just don't get why my

00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:55,619
I just don't get why my pi PI user name

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:58,839
its class free because it gets assigned

00:21:55,619 --> 00:22:01,179
it why that should not be workable

00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:04,089
there's lots of worlds where that

00:22:01,179 --> 00:22:08,320
happened and I I kind of forgot by but

00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:12,729
Sipan have both and had the offer driven

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:16,599
erock t we had had the another very the

00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:19,169
actual namespace Iraqi I think it's kind

00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:22,239
of inconsistent that pear pie pie

00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:25,869
doesn't have a name spaces and I I think

00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:28,629
it up we totally should have it and make

00:22:25,869 --> 00:22:43,619
it visible who is maintaining the

00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:43,619
package on I okay it was mine too just

00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,779
all right thank you very much thank

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,390
