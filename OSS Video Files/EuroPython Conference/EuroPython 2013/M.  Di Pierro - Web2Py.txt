hello and welcome back to room ravioli

00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,719
and our next speaker is going to be

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,800
Massimo TV arrow which is going to speak

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:47,390
about web development we like to pie

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:49,550
hello everybody thank you so so I come

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,589
from Chicago where a teacher DePaul

00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,149
University it's a very large school the

00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:56,659
largest department of computer science

00:00:53,149 --> 00:00:58,670
in the US but I'm a physicist anyway my

00:00:56,659 --> 00:01:01,280
job is to make web development easy and

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,440
that's why I made way to PI what does it

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
mean easy for me it does not mean dumb

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,300
down it does not mean visual programming

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,240
it means something more intuitive more

00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,250
expressive more powerful syntax easy

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:15,200
does not mean for kids it means for

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,369
experienced developers as well so you

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,110
can focus on more on your algorithms

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,390
rather than maintenance and you can

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:25,550
reduce your maintenance cost and I don't

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:27,500
claim any success I just tell you what

00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:30,740
I've been doing to try to achieve this

00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,829
goal of making web development easier so

00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:36,110
this is what's inside wodka pi so the

00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:39,200
basic idea is you get that zip file and

00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:41,210
in this zip file you have the web server

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,729
and you have a database abstraction

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,619
layer and you have the SQLite database

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:48,710
and you have a web based IDE

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:50,509
we also package all kind of libraries in

00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,520
there that we know they work together

00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:56,960
some we wrote some we took from third

00:01:52,520 --> 00:02:00,950
parties like generators for XML HTML

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,560
JSON RSS ICS PDF RTF services XML RPC

00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:05,840
just enough to see various methods of

00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,109
login LDAP um generally in Dropbox

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,590
Google cast open idea auth one two x.509

00:02:09,109 --> 00:02:15,049
certificates for login markup languages

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:17,090
mark min a mark down payment methods

00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:20,209
like Google Wallet authorized.net swipe

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:23,420
the net connection to memcache M radius

00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:25,070
and we use the layout of Twitter

00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,810
bootstrap so this stuff comes with it so

00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,519
you know it already works when you

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,310
install it the database abstraction

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,949
layer also supports many databases about

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,650
11 different databases so if you want a

00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:39,500
switch from SQLite to Postgres or Oracle

00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,630
or you can easily do it also worked with

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,160
Google App Engine and MongoDB so you use

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:47,720
one database obstruction layer and you

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:50,870
easily switch from from one to the other

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:55,190
so we have a lot of contributors I would

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:58,910
say 200-300 contributors at least 6000

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:03,260
registered users but we're more in 2011

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:06,290
we want the info word technology you

00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:09,050
know what the boss award in 2012 the

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,190
technology of the Year award so we

00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:12,739
borrowed some ideas from other

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,020
frameworks mother view control design

00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,290
based on WSGI

00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:19,670
from java we borrowed the idea of having

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,430
archives for application so we have this

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:24,350
w2p files that allow us to package a web

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,700
to PI application and transfer easily

00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,550
from one system to another

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,770
we have routing systems very similar to

00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:33,020
jungle the difference is that their

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,630
routes are the URLs are optional you

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,100
only do them if you want to we have a

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,930
template language which is very similar

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,480
to Michael it's in the sense that it's

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,780
pure Python but we have some differences

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,330
like we gotta do blocks from jungle we

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,280
have Alpers pretty much like rails with

00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:51,709
the difference that our helpers have the

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,180
same name of HTML tags like deep span a

00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:55,910
so it's easy to remember

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,920
whoever web base database interface very

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,760
much like Django admin we call it up

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:04,190
admin with some ideas of our own like

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,830
first we said this has to be always

00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:09,769
backward compatible so first release was

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:12,200
in 2007 we added a lot of features but

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,600
we never broke backward compatibility we

00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,799
promise we're not gonna do it unless we

00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:21,350
change the name with one-click

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,820
deployment for Windows Mac binaries or

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:24,620
you can install it on a USB Drive

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,110
wherever you go you plug it in you have

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,210
the web server running no configuration

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,280
no dependencies and secure by default

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,290
what that means is that basically there

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,210
are no configuration files when you set

00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:36,350
it up it's not like you don't have to do

00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:38,060
a configuration just there are no

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,419
configuration files not at the framework

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,930
level and secured by default means that

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:45,979
everything that certain basic

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,680
configuration settings that other

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:50,419
frameworks have that execute implication

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,770
we just lock them we don't allow the

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,280
users to

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,629
mess up with certain security things

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,910
another thing which is very different

00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:01,250
from Python frameworks is everything is

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:04,759
a default so here we follow much more

00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,860
Ruby on Rails for example you create a

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,409
controller you automatically get a view

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,539
you don't like it you changes you create

00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:13,129
a table in database you automatically

00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,690
get an interface to interact with that

00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:15,979
table you don't like it you changed so

00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:19,099
you can change everything but everything

00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:20,659
is a default another big difference from

00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,610
every other framework it's is multi

00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:24,319
project so you have one way to PI

00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,419
installation you can install as many

00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,069
applications as you want it doesn't

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:30,380
matter who created them they were not

00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:32,210
designed to work together but they will

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:36,830
work under one instance of the framework

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,000
and each two of them can by default have

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,830
everything separate their own

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,900
authentication they don't access control

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,259
their own databases but you can have

00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,210
them share data if you want them to

00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,409
there is a web-based ID and we can do

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,120
everything through that you can do

00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:52,849
development you can edit files

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,210
deployment management testing the

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:57,770
bugging version control to the ID but

00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,539
you don't have to use it like if you

00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,699
want to use Emacs in the shell you do

00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:04,639
that like you do it Jango and sometimes

00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:07,370
I do that another thing we do is

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,490
automatic DB migration so we like in

00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,039
Jungle you do a sync TB when you create

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,840
a table you have nothing like that here

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,819
you just write your table it

00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,500
automatically that's equivalent

00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:20,690
something you're going to simply be but

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,789
that's it for you and also you change

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,590
your models it automatically does alter

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:26,210
table for you there is nothing you have

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,710
to do basically you just edit your file

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,199
you say what the content is supposed to

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,940
be and we try to alter the table and

00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,729
port the data so that what's in the

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,740
database matches what you want also have

00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,190
a plug-in system and component system

00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,120
that work via Ajax and that I don't

00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,219
think I will have time to talk about

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
that today we were all basics s control

00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:48,289
mechanism and pluggable authentication

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,060
modules and we every app as a center of

00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:52,610
dedication service consumer and provider

00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,840
so you can install too much PI up and

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,120
you can say this one delegates

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,870
authentication to the other one that's

00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,460
built in by default in any app but there

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,289
is a built-in chrono but it really uses

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:05,710
that but there is a built-in master

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,419
worker task scheduler so you can say

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,009
I want ten workers and my web

00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:12,400
application can submit tasks to the

00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,169
workers every table is full auditing it

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,910
needs to be enabled but it's just a one

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:19,210
parameter that you can set at the

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:22,360
application level and we have Ajax

00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,220
embeddable controls so this is how it

00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,860
looks like and I think at this point I'm

00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:30,880
gonna get out of here and I'm gonna go

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:33,490
through well actually you know let me

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:36,699
run this demo so these types for me so

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:40,930
you don't load weight to PI and you

00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:43,449
unzip it and you go under it and you

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:45,340
start it and you say what password you

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:47,830
want to use it administrator and then

00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:49,599
you open it okay that's what this is

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,690
what you see and then you go to admin

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,220
staff interface and you say hello and

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:56,470
this is what you PI and now it doesn't

00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,380
quite fit but you make it fit

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,660
so this abdomen new application test

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,789
make a new application test use my new

00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:05,800
application I have the models

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:07,330
controllers and so on I can go and edit

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:11,889
all the kind of things I want to edit

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:14,289
here I can go back to my side I can see

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,090
all my applications installed I can edit

00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:18,070
them I can package them to give somebody

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:21,220
like I made this application test right

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,419
now I want to package it when I want to

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,039
give it to somebody and they want to

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:28,539
install it so they go there and they

00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,270
take it and they wanna install it with

00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,490
another name test three it's up and

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:38,740
running on the other machine okay that's

00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:41,469
how you do it let's say if you want if

00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,419
you want to look inside this this is

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,250
these are the actual modules it's only

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,110
one point six megabytes is smaller than

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,610
most of the other frameworks it's

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,220
actually smaller than some of the micro

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:55,300
frameworks except that he comes with

00:08:51,220 --> 00:09:00,779
applications okay so it actually comes

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:03,630
with where was I he comes with I

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:08,589
installed something elements told them

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:10,209
understood this understood this so it

00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,160
comes with three applications and that's

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,579
where all the space actually is so admin

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,020
is itself so the the web base ID is an

00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:19,389
application itself you can remove it

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,979
examples is a clone of my webs

00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:22,959
so the result the documentation they're

00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:24,399
welcome is the scaffolding application

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,929
every other application you make you

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,699
make a copy of welcome so you don't

00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:30,249
start from scratch so that's where all

00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:31,299
the space goes there are images there

00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:33,429
are things in there

00:09:31,299 --> 00:09:35,679
otherwise it's 1.6 megabytes is very

00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:37,719
small so let me make a new application

00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,699
called polls I can do it through the

00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:42,879
interface I can just make a folder and I

00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:45,969
can copy welcome in it ok and I can go

00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,309
in there and I accept editing files but

00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:51,359
actually I already made it it's there

00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:55,149
ok that's how you make an application

00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,849
now as we said we have different if I go

00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,649
into polls I have a structure in here so

00:09:57,849 --> 00:10:02,409
I have certain files it comes with and

00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:04,629
in particular models so the models of

00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:08,379
the file that contained the description

00:10:04,629 --> 00:10:11,199
of the data representation what you want

00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:14,349
to store in the database the controllers

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:18,299
are the workflow so every function here

00:10:14,349 --> 00:10:21,819
is a page and the views are the

00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:23,319
presentation of the data so given that

00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:25,179
you want to expose certain data or

00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:28,209
should the right be rendered in HTML or

00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:31,119
in JSON or in something else so let's

00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:34,089
make a polling application so let's

00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:35,739
create a table poll can you read it okay

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:37,989
let's forget that poll there's a field

00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:42,749
question and there's a field publication

00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:42,749
date which is date time and that's it

00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:51,429
now let's see what happened here and so

00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:56,949
let me do it from here I merely load

00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:59,709
this page ok so I have a database I

00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:01,539
already get this interface and I can

00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:04,029
already go and I can search the records

00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:08,589
in my pool table I already get this part

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:14,049
for free and I can go and see in the

00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:16,629
skill log that the table was created so

00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:22,539
you world SQL to create the table now

00:11:16,629 --> 00:11:24,849
let me change this ok so how did I

00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:26,649
change it first I said that the poll is

00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:28,269
a field question and also it's a

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,349
signature so I'm going to sign this

00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:33,040
pulse and also I have choices a choice

00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:35,860
of reference

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,850
Paul and as a text which is the option

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,440
and those votes

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,570
so given this poll there are many

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,209
choices each choice as the number of

00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:49,839
votes which is an integer so I do this

00:11:43,209 --> 00:11:51,970
and I go back here and I access my

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,000
database administration again so this

00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,920
other table was created and I see

00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,410
various things here like if I want

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,509
insert the record I've see that I have a

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,970
drop box I don't have options yet I'm

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:07,620
not creating anything there but another

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,459
thing I can see is that I go SQL log and

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,889
you did various things

00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:14,019
it created choice but also the adult of

00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:16,300
tables to change my other table for me

00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:17,920
okay it does not just do out the table

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,740
that's out the table create table drop

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,690
and moves data from one type to another

00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,589
if it knows how to do the conversion if

00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,329
it does not know how to do the

00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:28,839
conversion you will tell you I don't

00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:30,730
know how to do it okay so let's remove

00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:32,440
the default controller that it comes

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:36,040
with and let's make our own from scratch

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,319
okay so let's make a function in the X

00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:42,449
returns locals and let's make another

00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:45,550
function manage that requires login and

00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:47,470
returns what's called a smart grid so

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:52,029
give me a smart grid above this table

00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:54,399
Paul and also a give me away to expose

00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,199
authentication so this line was actually

00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:01,209
there before I delete it now air about

00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:03,130
it okay so what do we get now what we

00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:07,209
get now is this

00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:11,230
I now can actually click on Paul and I'm

00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:13,510
calling the function index inaccurate

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,550
another function called manage and I

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,500
said that require authentication so it's

00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:19,630
not allowing me to access that it wants

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,250
me to login but I already evolved

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,430
exposed authentication so you can

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,430
register

00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:34,380
so now I'm registered go back and now I

00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:39,900
have an interface to manage my polls

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,790
okay and I can do search this will give

00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,590
me pagination of kind of things what you

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:46,290
see right now here is the equivalent of

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,090
the jungle toolbar allows me to look at

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,940
the request object the response object

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:55,920
what's in the session which tables I AB

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:57,960
and wait and allow me to look at

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,610
database statistics so which selects

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,120
were done how long do they take things

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,060
like that

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,130
okay so let's populate this with some

00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:10,700
dummy data so if I don't have any poll

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,140
insert one that says which color and

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,870
color can be a red green or blue and

00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,880
make a insert the choice where the

00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,370
choice text is the color and the poll

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,830
this choice is about is the ID of the

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:29,460
poll okay so we do this and now we can

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:32,490
reload this thing okay so now I see that

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,470
I when I manage it and now this is this

00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,590
is at the application level the user

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,510
level so I can search for polls give me

00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:43,020
the polls that contain color well there

00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:46,200
is one of course I can view it I can

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,540
look at the choices for this poll I can

00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,770
edit the choices for this poll I can add

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,670
the choice to the poll I can do what

00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:55,470
kind of things already let's keep going

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,420
let's I did the controller that's at

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,470
some logic let's say that I've ever

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:04,050
write this index and I say from the data

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,390
from the table poll select everything

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:07,590
ordered by created on so the worst

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:11,850
chronological order when they were

00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:14,910
created return them and also at the

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:16,710
details action that is going to give me

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,020
the details about the poll and allow me

00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:23,190
perhaps devote a resource is going to

00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:26,220
show me the results of polls so it's

00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,560
more on let me remove the default view

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,420
that I always get the default one so we

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,140
get another one and let's make a new one

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,810
so we extend the default layout and if

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,520
we have a list of polls give me HTML

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,180
table and for every poll in the list of

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,550
polls

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,310
the thing and this is very similar to

00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,870
the Jenga template language except that

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,100
this pure Python you don't need to learn

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,920
anything else anything you can do with

00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,810
Python you can do it here you open the

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,480
block with column you close the block

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,630
with pass okay that's it that's the only

00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,500
thing you need to know like else pass

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:03,190
that's the only thing you really need to

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:06,459
know so we're done with this

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:09,580
so let's reload our application now so

00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:12,760
I'm glad I love this thing and I'm gonna

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:16,000
reload actually index not manage okay so

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,610
this shows me my polls so if I now click

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,529
on which color it goes to details

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:26,260
I've not implemented details so let's do

00:16:20,529 --> 00:16:29,050
that so let's implement details and

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:36,100
let's say get the argument so which poll

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:42,279
get that poll return that poll and let's

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:45,970
I did the let's do one more thing let's

00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:49,300
also get a form about this poll and this

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:52,600
is going to be a form that displays the

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:56,410
choice and the options and uses a radio

00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:59,470
widget and let's I did the view for this

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,029
detail which extend the layout it tells

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:06,579
me the poll questions it shows me the

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:08,589
form and let's reload this okay so let's

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:13,780
go back where I was I now click on this

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:15,819
and I get the radio widget okay so we

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:19,510
have this again and now we say that if

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:22,240
the form is processed and accepted get

00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:24,850
to the choice I voted for update the

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,949
record increase the votes to 1 say

00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:30,010
thanks for voting and rather like they

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:35,679
use it to the results page results page

00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:41,380
takes this poll and return it again so

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:43,210
now I can vote for green and submit I

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,100
get to the result page I have some

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,840
default which basically tells me just

00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,540
see voted but it's not showing anything

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,580
yet because this is not implemented so

00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,860
we implement that so the results page

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:57,250
should say which question

00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,920
and display each choice from these poor

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:03,700
choices and the number of votes for each

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,790
choice so now I just reload this page

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:09,910
and it tells me there's one vote for

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:15,850
green now as this is as this application

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:17,200
is built it lacks something the so far

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,820
is the same as the jungle poll

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,549
application that you may have seen in

00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,470
the jungle web page now let me vote for

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:25,030
blue

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,230
so now there is one vote for green this

00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:29,340
one vote for blue I can vote as many

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,470
times as I want this is not good okay

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,179
but this is I just was trying to mimic

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,700
the the jungle poll application so you

00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:39,370
can tell the differences

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:46,809
okay let's I did the database again and

00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:50,980
let's say that we have the new table

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:56,590
vote and we say which poll we voted for

00:18:50,980 --> 00:19:01,020
and we sign this vote and we also enable

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:01,020
record versioning so full auditing and

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,850
for testing purposes we just make

00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,919
something more complicated which not

00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:11,350
don't really need to do but if I'm

00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:13,419
logged in and if I'm not a member of the

00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:17,440
user administrators make me member of

00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:19,390
the user administrator okay now let's

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,570
edit the controller's again and say that

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:27,900
we require login to see the details and

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:31,419
to vote and if I try to access this vote

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:33,580
and there's already a record for me say

00:19:31,419 --> 00:19:35,559
that I voted already otherwise and

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,460
redirect me to the main page otherwise

00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:42,190
if the form the voting form is processed

00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:44,650
and accepted recorded choice insert a

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,960
new record in vote in which you say that

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:51,700
this poll was voted by me he knows who I

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:54,100
am also say that a few other things for

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,900
fun let's add our food wiki to this

00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:57,549
application so I can document it and

00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,559
let's say that I can only access the

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:05,020
manage page if I member of the group of

00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:07,720
admin users and and that's it so I think

00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,300
we're done with this oh one more thing

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:16,540
so let's see what we have done so far so

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:19,450
now let me go to index again so I can

00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,520
vote because I just introduced the

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,700
counting of the votes so now I'm gonna

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,140
vote for green again submit so now

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,830
they're two votes for green one for blue

00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:34,030
if I now try to vote again which color

00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:36,880
you voted already okay if I try to go to

00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:40,870
manage well I can because I member of

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,230
the user of the group of admit myself

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:48,640
member I can see the choices I can see

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:52,900
the votes see the choices I can see the

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:57,400
votes a few other things I want to show

00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:59,170
you there are results for poll number

00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,760
one so it shows me the results right it

00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:05,620
shows me in HTML because I made that in

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:09,730
HTML view well what if I want this in

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:13,540
XML I get in XML what if I want this in

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:15,640
Jason so by default this exports the

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,220
data in all kind of things so if a

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:20,950
controller returns some data by default

00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:25,300
in Osho to represent it for you in XML

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:27,610
HTML Jason ICS calendar RSS Google Maps

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,950
depending on the data you you return you

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,390
knows what to do you can override that

00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,640
that's what we have done for the HTML

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,550
but you have the other ones you always

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,830
get them unless you disable them okay so

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,750
another thing we want to do is fix the

00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:44,220
menu because this default menu is

00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,550
scrapped so we change it and we say that

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,630
there is a menu file and it's another

00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:52,030
configuration file at the application

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,100
level and we say that the title supposed

00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:57,370
to be Paul's the subtitle is dead and

00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:00,280
with a menu and we want to go thank you

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,950
from home to the default index from we

00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,710
keep the wiki page from manage to the

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:07,540
manage page and that's it okay in this

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,310
this is actually end of the presentation

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:12,070
now I have the menu here so and I can go

00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:14,740
to home I can see my election my polls I

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:17,770
can go to wiki and I can create wiki

00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:20,020
pages and I can edit wiki pages a wiki

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,309
same tax and so on I can only do that

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,950
because I'm administrate

00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:25,630
I can manage my poles now this is a

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:28,570
fully working application I can add my

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:31,120
profile as a user I can change my

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:32,110
password I can log out and you can do

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:40,870
all this kind of things

00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:44,250
so this is where to party questions I

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,250
was really cool

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:58,120
I don't have a question okay yeah I was

00:22:55,899 --> 00:23:01,000
wondering how easy it is to start to

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,070
change the main template and another

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,870
thing is that yeah there you have it you

00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:08,919
seem to have like all this like

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:10,840
debugging controls and stuff is it easy

00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,110
to get rid of them for like if you want

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,480
to oh you see now I got rid of them yeah

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,600
they're not there anymore as soon as you

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:24,100
give a view you create a view they go

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,019
away in the default view there are there

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,419
are they are there as soon as you

00:23:26,019 --> 00:23:30,370
implement them they go away and you can

00:23:28,419 --> 00:23:31,690
implement a one-line default you can

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,559
even change the default you can say by

00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,750
default I don't want them so a few

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:39,669
things which I did not mention there is

00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,009
a built-in ticketing system every time

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:44,019
there is a bug in the application the

00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:45,730
user is issued a ticket the ticket is

00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:47,230
recorded tickets with the same trace

00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,879
back a group together there is an

00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,039
interface to access all the tickets you

00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:52,750
can see which user has the problem you

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:58,509
can see trace back all the variables for

00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,710
that user there is a web-based shell

00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:01,299
there are some things I didn't talk

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,129
about I didn't talk about the Ajax

00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:04,990
controls I mean all this contrast can be

00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:11,200
accessed via Ajax and embedded in other

00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:13,419
pages yeah but thanks for the talk a

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,519
Caterpie question is it and python

00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:20,649
that's also free support Python 3 or was

00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:26,379
it something this is 2.7 we support 26

00:24:20,649 --> 00:24:28,330
to point 5 to point 6 to point 7 this a

00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:30,970
previous version this has been ported to

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:33,010
Python 3 but we don't want it to be

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,130
ported to Python 3 and the reason is we

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:36,440
have a promise of backward

00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:39,050
the building so what we are going to do

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,450
we are going to have our what 3pi that

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,850
is different will have some of the same

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:46,160
features will work with Python 2 and

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:49,400
python 3 and if you choose to run it and

00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,320
fight in 2.7 will run existing what 2 pi

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,210
code but it would be a new thing called

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,480
web 3 PI and we already working on it

00:24:53,210 --> 00:25:02,270
so we should be done by long ago i

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:03,740
promise by March so yeah I have to say

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:05,600
there's not been that much pressure to

00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:12,830
get it done people like this a lot of

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:14,450
people said don't change are you doing

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,520
some changes in web 3 pi compared to

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:17,960
this in in a way how things work what

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,970
are the most important differences

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,770
ok from from the user interface we don't

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,380
want to change the user interface from

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:26,090
most of the libraries there is very

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,530
little change which is required that's

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,390
in fact two people have separately

00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:34,690
ported already to Python 3 ok we just

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:38,570
don't say any tell anybody and the

00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:40,250
problem is what other changes do we want

00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,210
to make me if we're going to break

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:44,330
backward compatibility

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:46,160
let's make in a bold way and there are

00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:49,580
two groups of people that want to

00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,410
opposite things and the one of the big

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,240
features for me here is the fact that

00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:55,370
you have one instance and your multiple

00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,050
applications and they separate

00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,940
everything they can even use different

00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,280
versions of same Python modules and they

00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,230
are separated that's done because python

00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,500
modules because controllers are not

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:08,930
imported they are executed this is the

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,510
one thing that 50% of people love

00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,550
because you can do this and 50% of

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:22,140
people 8 because they say that's not our

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:24,730
Python works you break certain things

00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:27,340
you still import modules mean you're

00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:29,980
still import modules but the controllers

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:32,080
are not imported so if they control it

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:33,640
just decide the functions expose pages

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:35,679
and then those function imports

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,020
something else everything is you can

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,760
still use modules so the thing is should

00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,340
we get rid of that and change it or not

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,290
and yes we can we can make it a little

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,630
faster if we do but we lose something

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:49,240
functionality people like so we're not

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,190
really reached a consensus so our plan

00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,290
is to remove it and at the compatibility

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,900
layer where you can say I want it this

00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,970
is what you are trying to do sorry I

00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:00,550
have a question before I've never used

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,790
web to Playa never it looks really

00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:08,679
really amazing next thing I wanna do is

00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:12,670
try this one question I had is in one of

00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,870
your views okay or no in one night in

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,470
the controller in the in one of the

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:21,520
controllers you had so you basically did

00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:24,160
return locals yes I just need for a

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,500
4-speed okay but that that isn't

00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:28,360
recommended or

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:30,460
it's not really an issue you can really

00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,350
turn dicta and you return specifically

00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:38,470
what objects you in turn I'm just saying

00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:41,110
like okay but but in any case I'm saying

00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:45,870
it's not it's not a good is it a good

00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:48,850
practice to do that or as long as you

00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:51,670
that's a security issue if you use the

00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,710
generic views the default views that's a

00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,390
security issue because you may be able

00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,780
to access variables turn on meant to be

00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,970
exposed

00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:01,300
the default views by default are

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:02,830
disabled unless you are on localhost so

00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,480
there you have them during development

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:08,559
but in production that you actually go

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,300
away so that security issue goes away if

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,390
I we recommend that you always return a

00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,840
dict I find if I have like if I'm port a

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:18,450
module can I access it yes you can

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,280
import any patent module you like

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:24,520
normally as you would normally do but

00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,220
when you do locals so let's say I have a

00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,590
module called admin sorry like settings

00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:31,059
or something no no no unless unless you

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,980
import it into the function if you

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:33,760
import the outside the function now if I

00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:37,300
imported out

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,740
yes okay okay cool just one thing I

00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,230
forgot to say which I think it's really

00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:44,290
nice is I want to show you if you want

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:47,860
to do internationalization you choose

00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:49,810
your language like Italian and you click

00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:51,310
Edit and you translate to Italian here

00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:56,070
I was late your strings and you click

00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:56,070
Submit in Italian it's very very cool I

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,860
have some questions about installation

00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,380
of this framework because last time I

00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:08,200
check it it was not possible to install

00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:12,580
it from PI P I know you don't

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,610
yes so what's behind this decision it's

00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:17,830
okay it's really not a decision when we

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:22,000
made it we made it in the form of a zip

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:26,010
file because we don't want it to affect

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,590
or be affected by which Python packages

00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:31,390
you have you most people for example may

00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:33,160
have two or three different versions of

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,380
where to buy running when they need to

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:37,240
port stuff so we don't want to make that

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,590
easy so you have one what version where

00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,590
two pi and then you still another

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:43,780
version you copy your files over and so

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:46,570
you can make a highway what about

00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:48,280
virtual and environments can you use it

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:50,440
you can use virtual and so the only

00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,180
problem with pi pi is there's nothing

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,400
that in principle prevents it from work

00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:56,470
in fact it did work it's just that the

00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:01,140
guy who did it

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:03,610
kind of disappeared so I did not have

00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,410
you know the pressure to to fix it

00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:09,610
because mostly people just get that zip

00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:11,920
file but there's no reason why that

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:14,470
cannot be it's a pie pie configuration

00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,630
issue is not a word to buy a ship so are

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,520
you open for contributions yes oh

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:22,000
absolutely absolutely we have we have

00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:25,480
Google Code github Google Code a Google

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,180
Group very much you know at this point

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,520
other people do most development than me

00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,930
I mean I did the beginning and I still

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,930
check everything but thank you

00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,510
um just wanted to ask let's say with the

00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,180
installation and production yeah like

00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:52,790
how is it for example it's a skill you

00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:55,620
set up if you go to the github repo and

00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:59,280
there is a folder here called scripts

00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:02,520
and you find scripts for kind of things

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,610
like set up on Heroku sit up on nginx

00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,470
WSGI on Santo ax and what they do is you

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,090
just download that one script you run

00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:10,710
that one script you install everything

00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:12,350
for you including the open SSL

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:14,640
Certificates

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,950
so you just pick the configuration you

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,050
want you may need minor tweaks but they

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,900
would that's how we install I don't even

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:25,230
get the zip file I can get that question

00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:28,320
so do you think there is still a reason

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:30,810
to use Django or or this could replace

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,560
anything any new project that you would

00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:37,350
do a jungle now that's a question I'd

00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,350
already wanna answer being record I'm

00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:42,930
gonna answer let me say let me say this

00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:45,960
I was a jungle user before creating work

00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:47,280
to PI okay and I did this confirm

00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,110
entrances for the United Nation was

00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,030
relatively big project and a really

00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:52,920
enjoyed jungle we invited the people who

00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:55,170
made django on my university to give

00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,240
talks and I really liked John I still

00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:59,400
did a very much like jungle and Stingers

00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,810
a much bigger community and we do about

00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:06,660
5 to 10 times bigger personally and

00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:09,570
jungle is a little faster in certain

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:12,180
it's up to 2 times faster it depends on

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:15,210
what you do from the point of view the

00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:17,880
development time I always find that pi

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:20,460
is much faster and less code to write I

00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,970
have not really found something for

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,290
which I need jungle that I cannot do in

00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:28,950
work by never found that because any

00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:31,560
module out there except people right now

00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,000
our problem is a community is that a lot

00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:35,250
of people contacted me and say we have

00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,830
jobs and we wanted to be any web 2 pi

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:41,370
because after it's developed we know to

00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:43,410
do the maintenance and so people ask me

00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,510
and they're not enough people I mean I

00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,650
don't know who's gonna do this project I

00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,370
don't know what to say because I that's

00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,990
not my job

00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:52,620
the consultant and sometimes I do buy

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:55,110
these rare my job is to teach so right

00:32:52,620 --> 00:33:00,780
now that's a major problem be nice to

00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:03,860
have more people all right thank you

00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,860
