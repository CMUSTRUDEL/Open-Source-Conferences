my game is really just a fire routine

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:12,120
wrapper around sdl and HDL is a simple

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,410
directs the media liar it's a see

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,750
library for for interacting with with

00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:22,109
the screen a graphics library basically

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,230
and an input library so it's also read

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:28,590
lets you read keyboard and mouse and

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:31,769
joysticks and things like that and tie

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:36,440
game also has some songs of support

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:38,910
added into the mix but those are really

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,010
seen wrappers around the graphics

00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,320
libraries and sound libraries and stuff

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,190
like that and they don't really have

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,340
anything like a game framework has so

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,789
they the PI game doesn't force an

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,100
instructor on your application so you

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,100
are completely free how you write your

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:02,489
code you can have main loop you can have

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,970
no main loop and some kind of a reactor

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,580
from twisted or some and process events

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,320
or don't use events check the keyboard

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:17,040
every time and because of that it's

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:23,240
really hard for the new people to start

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:25,830
making games with it yes okay sorry and

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,890
it's really hard to make games with it

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,030
because you don't know where to start

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,810
there is nothing more scared than a

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:36,600
white piece of paper write and write

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,100
something or drown so weak and you have

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:43,979
no idea what the second thing that

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,710
happens is that you start making your

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,369
game and you make a really bad

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,170
architecture so you just slap drinks as

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,829
you need them you put all the

00:01:52,170 --> 00:02:00,420
controlling code inside the sprite

00:01:54,829 --> 00:02:03,659
itself and generally you end up with a

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,250
mess that kinda works but it's very hard

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,979
to maintain in very hard to extend so

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,740
that's why my game is a fine tool if you

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:15,350
know how to use it and

00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,900
there are a lot of libraries actually

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:21,830
used by game and give you some more

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:29,180
structure but I wouldn't recommend using

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:32,480
my game to a new game developer and what

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:38,450
should we use so from what I knew no

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:41,530
there is pilot which is a little bit

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:44,720
more structured for example it forces a

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,570
main loop on you it has some scene

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,710
management at least a skeleton of that

00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:54,100
and unlike by game its accelerated so

00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:57,790
it's actually faster modern hardware

00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:00,980
where a spy game still uses the

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:04,340
techniques from from the 90s where you

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:07,460
push individual pixels to the screen so

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:13,070
it can be a challenge to write a fast

00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:17,630
game in that water there is cocos2d

00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:20,150
which is based on piglet and as a lot of

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,550
this structure to your game so they have

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,830
a lot of libraries that already give you

00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:27,670
the map for example or give you the

00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:31,460
scene management or give you twinning

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:35,470
animations sprites management and stuff

00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:38,390
like that so that's probably a very good

00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,600
starting point there are a lot of

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:45,380
tutorials and Kirk of 2d also has

00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:48,380
version for the iphone it's for the

00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:52,100
objective-c so the code is not really

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,110
portable but but the API is similar and

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:57,790
at least there is a lively community

00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:00,730
around that so that's another option

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:04,940
authors there is the blender game engine

00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:08,120
which is mostly for 3d games and it's

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,620
mostly for it's nice because you can do

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:16,220
stuff in blender and then animate it

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,859
with Python or do stuff in Python and

00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,349
make Python generates 3d objects and

00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:27,280
stuff like ice so that

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:31,780
also quite nice there is funded 3d which

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:35,440
is also 3d obviously and which is a c++

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,780
like like blender but also scripted in

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,430
Python but I don't really know much

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,610
about that I know that there was a

00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,819
tutorial about panda 3d last year in

00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:51,190
Europe item I even attended it but I

00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:54,909
didn't pay attention through it so I

00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:57,430
didn't really learn much oh sorry about

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:59,650
that I can't tell you more maybe you

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,259
have other suggestions or you have

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,759
something more to say about game

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:08,650
development so yeah are you can I II

00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,819
just you know like take your place right

00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,620
thank you so sorry to interject like

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:17,050
this but I could like talk for hours but

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,969
the silica I just managed say just two

00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,800
things so I was just going to point out

00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:22,300
to get really pie game is like last

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,389
millennium technology its kind of

00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:29,889
wrapper around lib sdl which is sick

00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:31,810
hold and it only does 2d actually they

00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:33,580
nice difference the main difference with

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,029
piglet is that Picard is actually a

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,979
wrapper under over opengl so you

00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:41,080
basically can do 3d as long as you have

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:43,240
x rated r the word and stuff and then

00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,610
there's a whole story around cocos which

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,009
is very interesting which is because the

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,500
name comes from a small argentinian city

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,680
where a colleague of mine lucia tory and

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:56,289
another guy put together cocos based on

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,849
a pig good there and then what happened

00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,279
was that there's this other guys which

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:02,169
is ricardo casada which actually made a

00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:05,009
business on top of it because he

00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:07,960
maintains a number of different cocos2d

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:10,629
parts like you say there is an iphone

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:13,360
version but there's also cocos2d dash x

00:06:10,629 --> 00:06:15,580
which you can use C++ on it and then

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,460
there's also a JavaScript version so you

00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,020
can actually use Coco's right games

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,360
which are in the browser you drop you

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,789
sit there is not Python anymore but it's

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,919
JavaScript but you still have the same

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:30,490
architecture so if you use Coco's with

00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:32,649
Python you basically get experience and

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,990
games which are easily portable on

00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:35,770
different platforms which is quite nice

00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,090
and

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,970
last thing that I want to say is that

00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,220
since I very much interested in audio

00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:44,169
and sound stuff there is this bad

00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,150
situation in person nowadays be great

00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:49,629
that we basically looks like we do not

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:52,990
have a rapper other open al which is the

00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:55,419
main API for audio but actually there is

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,240
one it's also very very well hidden

00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:01,539
inside piglet so if you go and download

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,819
piglet and then install AV beam which is

00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:06,370
a binary thing that me that's used to

00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:09,370
play audio and video and then you look

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,750
into the examples of piglet and see

00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:13,780
there's a thing which is called

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,220
soundscape which is very nice virtual

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:17,229
audio interface where you have a

00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,360
listener and for musical instruments and

00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:21,849
you move stuff around and do sound

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,310
mixing in space in different directions

00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:29,310
and stuff like that and that uses an

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:32,050
open-air wrapper which is built in in in

00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,930
piglet whose documentation is basically

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:37,060
one page up with six why no text and

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:39,789
that's how you have which is kind of bad

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:44,169
but it's kind of workable so yeah two

00:07:39,789 --> 00:07:47,530
minutes not bad thank you well anybody

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:49,990
else can propose something or tell about

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:58,409
his difference his experiences or

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:58,409
something like that oh okay

00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,940
while I don't exactly have any examples

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:15,539
or anything of the sort unfortunately

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:17,610
and nobody actually brought up Kiwi but

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:25,770
I really don't know that much about it

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:28,139
myself so one moment I just there is

00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:31,940
another thing when you want your game to

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:35,880
work on on mobile phones you basically

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:39,769
there is a PI game subset for android

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:44,159
which is kind of nice the ramp i right

00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:48,089
okay too many ideas at the same time so

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,060
the rent by guys made wanted to port

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:54,240
their pie game based framework to

00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:58,350
Android so they ported up a big chunk of

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:02,700
pie game and made it made it work on

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,920
Android with some modifications so your

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,670
pie game game won't work on Android

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,880
right right directly but you can add

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:15,209
some small changes to them to make them

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,630
work and then you can actually make a

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:21,450
binary and and put it on them on the

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:23,550
Google Play for example and there are

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,730
several games like that that are already

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:31,110
there so that also works but what works

00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:34,740
even better because it's ki v which I

00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:37,350
think there was some talk about it or at

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,930
least a poster session about TV which

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:43,020
was initially for creating user

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:46,140
interfaces but right now it's actually

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:51,329
pretty good at doing interactive

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:53,730
graphics so games are very games I brain

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:58,649
basically interactive multimedia

00:09:53,730 --> 00:10:01,199
applications so just want to say a few

00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:04,680
words about kevia because I've used the

00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:06,510
TV for a just a simple like arcade

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:09,209
gaming you know to create your kids game

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,949
actually works in on droid and iphone

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,340
pretty well but it's still using the PI

00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:15,710
game

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,090
is if you want to install it somewhere

00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,130
in isolated environment you'll probably

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,870
fail this requires some development I

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,150
tried was a build-out I failed and

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,940
there's a guy from TV somewhere here

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:28,970
we'll ask him to help me so finish this

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,690
project yeah so it's quite quite amazing

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:35,690
framework which has a lot of great GUI

00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:37,610
which is really easy to handle but you

00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:41,360
still have to use my game so I know it's

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,920
basically works in this table but maybe

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:54,890
we don't have much i'll turn see from

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:58,430
that yes there is another thing if you

00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:01,580
really want some someone comes to you

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:05,000
and says okay i would really like to

00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:07,580
make a game but i can't program but i

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,180
would want to start making something i

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:15,860
have great idea for scenario for a plot

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:17,570
for for an adventure game and I have all

00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,020
the dialogues and all the characters in

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:25,880
my head I just need something to make it

00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:28,310
run then look at run pi r n pi is a an

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,470
engine a game engine for building

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,630
interactive fiction games basically

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,330
graphical interaction interactive

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,950
fiction games so they are like those I

00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,460
don't know if you have seen those

00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:42,860
Japanese games where you have manga

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,610
characters that have a lot of dialogues

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:50,030
and once upon a time you have many where

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,820
you select your next next action like go

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:56,210
to the game or invite that girl for a

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:59,900
dinner or something like that and lots

00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:03,500
of them are hentai games actually so but

00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:07,130
not not not just does there are in Japan

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:10,190
there are very very popular and they

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:13,580
have very involved plots like like books

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:17,480
and sometimes even more because you have

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:23,590
a lot of choices so you can explore much

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:25,660
wider area with that and

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,530
around pay is a really a professional

00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,840
framework it's built on top of my game

00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,090
but you don't have to write any Python

00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,210
you just write the dialogues and the

00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:40,060
choices and then you have like labels

00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:42,700
you can jump to when you make selections

00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,740
so it's really easy to start you have to

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:46,840
draw the characters and the backgrounds

00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,750
and things like that but of course you

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,940
can use some red ones or just steal them

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:54,340
from the internet if you don't plan on

00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:59,370
sending your game of course or use them

00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:02,830
as placeholders and replace later and

00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:04,630
you can play a right Python in there if

00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:07,660
you want to have something non-standard

00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:11,020
and that's also nice because you can

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:14,320
start with something completely simple

00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,540
and then add some additional stuff when

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,060
you need that and it's a great way to

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,070
really mart making something to finish

00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,120
something because that's the hardest

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:27,250
part when making games to actually

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:31,420
something to the end and and have

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:35,680
something to release so that's a big

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:40,930
recommendation what else can I recommend

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,030
about tools what tools to use pregnant

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:46,240
for graphics personally I use

00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:49,000
because I like I'm used to game but

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,870
I can imagine that a lot of people when

00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,790
they see they just put it off

00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:58,720
instantly because it's not a very

00:13:54,790 --> 00:14:03,430
friendly user interface so I have found

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,670
a really nice editor for pixel sprite

00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,860
that's called pickle it works on Windows

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:14,650
and online ups because it's written in

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:17,920
adobe air and yeah that's kind of

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:20,350
flexible it's really well done in the

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,830
sense that it has exactly the things you

00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:26,020
need for pixel art and nothing more it

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:28,870
has even some previews where you can

00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:33,130
create the walls for you for your game

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:36,160
in a way that they connect in the right

00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,670
way and then it shows you preview if

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,870
they

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:46,030
we collect connect right so pickle is is

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:48,760
a nice editor and if you want to make

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,440
maps for your games and those games are

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:55,570
for exam top down games or platformers

00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:00,010
of course you can just put them in a

00:14:55,570 --> 00:15:02,980
text file and then try to edit that but

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:08,410
there is a great editor 44 game maps

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:12,910
it's called Tillett tiled probably and

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:16,720
it has bindings for all the popular game

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:19,720
frame has bindings for Python it has

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,260
bindings for pie games specifically so

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,620
so that's very useful because you don't

00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:30,610
have to write all this logic and it

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:35,320
supports layers of the map layers of

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:39,040
tiles auto tiling a lot of nice things

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,440
that are already there and you can make

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,730
them up you can tell someone else to

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,180
make the maps for you and they don't

00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:50,680
have to learn your strange format it's

00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:55,090
just what you see is what you get okay

00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:59,920
that's that for sound because it's it's

00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:01,570
a lot of games a lot of indie games

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,380
don't have sounds because they're hard

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,660
to make it's very hard to record a sound

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,390
clearly and then to cut it clearly and

00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:15,790
then remove any noise from from it and

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:22,930
stuff like that and there is a tool

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:26,830
that's called be F X are like FX is like

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,620
for FX and FX are is because of flicker

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:34,890
and things like that and B is because

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:38,190
it's a second version so be F X air and

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:42,280
it's basically a sound effect generator

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:47,050
you it gives you a lot of smoke knobs

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:50,380
that you can turn and try to generate

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:54,490
various game effects like like the sound

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:59,980
of the coin from Mario or a laser shot

00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:03,730
sound or explosion or a scream or things

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:05,530
like that and you it's really easy to

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:08,050
use because you just click on random and

00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:16,120
until you get something that sounds

00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:18,790
quite what you not want and then we'd

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,120
tweak it a little bit with those knobs

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:26,830
to get exactly what you need and it just

00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:31,780
saves our web file wav file so it's easy

00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:36,700
to use in an in any game engine it's not

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:43,720
written in Python but it's a web

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:46,630
application here oh I see ok well flash

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:51,880
another pair are kind of popular among

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:55,350
game developers for some reason and what

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,350
else can I recommend

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,730
okay so I said that the hardest part of

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:12,320
making a game is actually finishing it

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:15,560
and for that because I know a lot of

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,300
people who say oh I'm reading the game

00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,730
of my life it will be awesome when I

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:24,380
finish it I'm already reading it for ten

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:28,280
years and that's not a joke they

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:30,470
actually are but they because they they

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,650
come with new ideas and and every week

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:35,780
they say oh I trained I completely

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,670
change the idea of my game it's not

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:42,290
going to be a platform it's going to be

00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:45,310
a first person perspective shooter so it

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:48,850
happens when it takes too long right

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:51,950
that's why you should really start

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:56,120
making small games that you can finish

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:58,550
in like a week or a weekend and the best

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,890
way to do that is to take part in Game

00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:04,060
grams there are a lot of game times

00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:07,460
there is for example ludum dare which is

00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:11,090
48 hours game time you have 48 hours to

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:14,660
make again from scratch and post it on

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:17,600
the website and they then they do they

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,150
play all the games and vote on them and

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,460
stuff like that but the important thing

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,070
is when you have a deadline you really

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,930
plan for something small because you

00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:28,780
want to finish it in that deadline and

00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:31,780
then you have something finished and

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:36,220
there are many games that actually

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:39,770
started on a jam do you know what of goo

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,560
that game was I think it was for pie

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:46,800
week or something like that for some

00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,230
game jam where the word

00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,970
team was gravity or something like that

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:56,790
and the guy had this ID he tried he only

00:19:53,970 --> 00:20:01,050
made a couple of levels I think two or

00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:03,930
three levels and submitted that game and

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:06,510
people liked it very much so he started

00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:08,870
to expand it and to work on it some more

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:14,190
and today it's one of the top-selling

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:16,080
indie games in the world I absolutely

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:19,140
need to add something about that because

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,820
that's one of my favorite games and I

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,980
think the Kyle Gabler is an absolute

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,410
genius because he's the one who designed

00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:29,040
the game who made the visuals who made

00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:32,220
the sounds and the music and what you

00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,200
really need to do if you even like the

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,030
music of world who even a little tool

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,700
you need to go to go to the world of goo

00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:40,950
website and download the soundtrack it's

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,930
done there's free downloadable it's

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,750
uncanny music and you really want to

00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,610
listen to it again and again and again

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:51,300
about this music when he started to work

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:54,000
on that game he wanted to have bolero in

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,510
there because he had this dream of

00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,150
people coming out of the houses carrying

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:02,430
furniture and things and stuff and

00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,560
building a tower from them and then

00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:06,810
going back to their homes and bringing

00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:10,580
more stuff and and then when I run out

00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:10,580
of the stuff building

00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:17,089
like like I'm strange Manya and in the

00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:21,619
background of this dream he hit bolero

00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:24,679
Ravel bolero so initially thank you

00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:27,049
initially it was this music later they

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:31,429
changed it and it changed for the better

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:35,269
so but kind of interesting story there

00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:39,529
was a question back there Oh nope

00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:41,839
anymore I it seemed yeah okay and if

00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:44,949
someone of you have something more to

00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,949
suggest please

00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,220
hey

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:59,690
so they mean the way you described to

00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,490
create the music is complicated probably

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,140
if you recall it I mean with the

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,399
microphone and the life instruments here

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:09,409
it's complicated it's a sound

00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:12,169
engineering is another heart there is

00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:14,179
like a programmable music and actually

00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:18,200
I've got this examples first of all it's

00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:19,970
of course the trackers which you can

00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,799
create 8-bit music I mean like the old

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,840
school for Sega and Nintendo if you

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,539
remember and this is quite easy to learn

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,730
the most popular is the fast tracker but

00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:32,330
there is a port for multi-platform pod

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,340
called milky milky tracker I think it's

00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,200
really beautiful so you just problem

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,230
music in there so all you need to know

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,270
is basically a scale and it's easy to

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,460
learn there's plenty of tutorials I've

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:47,840
used that one and another man method

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:50,600
it's only available in the Mac called

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,730
impromptu which is also open sourcing

00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:56,210
you create music with a lisp language so

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:59,120
you can like plug any VST plugin in

00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,679
there and you just like writing the

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,110
algorithm for the sounds and usually

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,600
it's got psychedelic stuff but it works

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,720
and it's everything open source both of

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,720
them

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,140
then then there is also PD pure data

00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:22,480
yeah well maybe also good for like

00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:26,260
programmer type of people yes I think we

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,360
have to wrap it up and start and let

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,490

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,030
