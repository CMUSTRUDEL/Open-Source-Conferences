okay it's 9am and unusually for an

00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:32,029
Italian we're going to start the

00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:34,610
conference on time so welcome everyone

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:44,900
and as a tradition in the last few

00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:49,330
months this is a not working alright

00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:51,440
this is an NHA sanctioned event

00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:58,960
everything we do will be transmitted

00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:02,000
overseas don't worry about it okay so

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,549
part of this is that we finally managed

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,700
to get a very fast internet connection

00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:10,040
so this year we'll have a like last year

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,110
100 megabits that is available

00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,810
throughout the conference the Wi-Fi

00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:19,130
itself is not 100 megabits but we

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:21,710
haven't done that yet and there are two

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:23,690
networks a 2.4 gigahertz and a 5 diggers

00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:27,320
called Europe both Europe python and the

00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:29,390
password is a Python 2013 and they

00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,790
should be working throughout the venue

00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,620
and you should be transparently might be

00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,780
migrated from access point to access

00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,420
point and if you are having any issues

00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,300
with the Wi-Fi please go talk to the

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,780
people with a red shirts and something

00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:51,350
funny written behind if just a red shirt

00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:53,979
you're probably not liable like every

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:56,900
every Python sponsor conference that we

00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:59,930
abide by the code of conduct which is

00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,470
available at the URL displayed at the

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,030
bottom we are not very tolerant of

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,030
violations of the code of conduct

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:10,759
overall and but we also try not to be

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,670
like Judge Dredd we don't cast law upon

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,660
people we try to inform ourselves about

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,970
whatever happened in

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,480
strain in a situation that might be gray

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,950
line and gray area and if something we

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,080
determine that something has violated

00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:27,650
the code of conduct then we will take

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,270
measures and in case of very very bad

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,860
violations we will talk to the

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:36,500
authorities so behave properly do not

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:39,440
make anybody uncomfortable whether they

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:47,270

organize a little bit better the use of

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:03,990
the open space so on the front desk

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:07,269
there should be a ticket like this and

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:10,149
we live outside dashboards the like this

00:08:07,269 --> 00:08:11,439
too and you can take these tickets fill

00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,449
them out with the topic of your

00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,329
discussion that will happen in the open

00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:18,939
space and then in your ticketing the

00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:20,709
time slot available to you so that we

00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:23,110
can everybody can know what's going on

00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:28,559
in there and we don't a double booked

00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:28,559
the not infinitely available open space

00:08:28,769 --> 00:08:39,089
yeah so we still have room for partner

00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:39,089
programs you can still buy tickets and

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,870
the the meeting place is in front of the

00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:50,700
desk if you have booked your partner

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:52,590
program ticket the meeting is there one

00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,320
thing that for Africa automation is that

00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:59,880
we are live streaming but we also be

releasing the the videos as soon as

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:13,290
possible so this is the last year in

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:18,480
Italy ya know three years is enough I

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:22,290
think and we'll be announcing the new

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,830
venue in the new country way on

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:30,810
Wednesday we release the call for

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:37,320
proposals some weeks ago actually we are

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:41,730
sorry that it took so long to to release

00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:45,720
it because we didn't leave me so much

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:51,090
time for the the other teams to organize

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:54,000
and to release a proper proposal but

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,880
yeah they did we received a very very

00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,140
good proposal and we are just checking

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,410
it with with the teams so i might think

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,810
I talk by the the rest of the Python

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:11,220
your Python board that we are pretty

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:16,700
much happy with with that and yes it's

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,700
not unitary so enjoy thank you

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:32,060
so we are super early so will I guess

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,000
we'll just play a game or we'll have the

00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,000
first doc know without the first call

00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:50,959
you have time to go go over there's a

00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,089
question I have no idea I I don't think

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,029
so there's too many of them at the same

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,709
time and cameras are only able to we're

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:00,709
only able to do live streaming and do

00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:03,370
the records the recording of the main

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,370
conference rooms

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,520
yeah you if you if you want to snoop

00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:13,880

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,730
other conference beat by I think six

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,320
months so you were the first one here

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,470
we're going to be talking about a lot of

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,610
things and as we go through I want to I

00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,110
want you to know if you have some

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,330
questions if you have some comments feel

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:28,170
free to make them because this is really

00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:30,420
about all of you and about how important

00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:34,290
it is to support and to build the Python

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:38,880
community you know first of all i have

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:40,920
to say i have to say congratulations to

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,390
the arrow python organizers especially

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,190
everybody who's wearing a yellow shirt

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,120
or the people who are up there let's

00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,120
give them a round of applause

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:54,789
you know in fact if they could for the

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,209
organizers they could stand up for a

00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:57,209
second

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:05,560
yeah they're all working all right you

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,390
know I had the opportunity to do sort of

00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,880
the same thing that they were doing over

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,190
over in the US version and you know it

00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,930
is an incredible amount of work and you

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,580
don't realize it when you're just coming

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:18,880
to the event and you're attending

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:21,400
because if everything goes perfectly

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,680
well and the organizers have done all

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,590
their all their jobs correctly you

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,910
actually nothing goes wrong and you

00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:31,240
don't notice it it ends up being

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:33,970
invisible but it is truly an amazing

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,510
amount of work to get the talks to

00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,070
corral the speakers to put together the

00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,250
beautiful printed program to do all

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:44,710
these things and so this is an amazing

00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:47,970
amount of work it's a really a labor of

00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:51,340
love and they have done an excellent job

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,820
though I want to talk a little bit about

00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:57,460
python python is actually just about 20

00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,890
years old you know the first public

00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:02,610
release of Python was in February 1991

00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:04,839
but I was looking back through the

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,410
through the history and the archives and

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:11,620
it turns out that this month is actually

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:14,339
the 20-year anniversary of the point 99

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:19,750
version of Python it was released i

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:23,080
believe it was released 29 july 1993 so

00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:26,230
just slightly shy of 20 years python has

00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,940
been around in essentially a finished

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,400
form where people are really deploying

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:34,120
this doing this using it for all sorts

00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,160
of things you know python was originally

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,010
conceived as a skunk works project it

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,050
was just Guiteau he just he didn't have

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:42,790
any budget and he said you know what I

00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:47,140
need to do some things to really make

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:49,300
this work to make it so that I I can the

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,610
the people will support it Hughes at CWI

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:53,500
in Amsterdam at the time and so said

00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:55,270
what can you do and so this led to a

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:58,500
number of really interesting design

00:15:55,270 --> 00:16:01,570
choices that he made you know he said

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:04,300
first things borrow ideas from wherever

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:07,030
you can you know don't try and reinvent

00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,880
the wheel look for the good things he he

00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:10,930
specifically noted the the value of

00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,460
Algol 68

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,290
and some of these and see and some of

00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,330
these other languages that he had grown

00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:18,940
up grown up with and said these were

00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:20,380
very important said make things as

00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,240
simple as possible one of the things

00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,310
that makes Python great is that you tend

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,290
to take the same sorts of concepts and

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:29,709
you reuse them over and over again in

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:32,350
the same in the same way and so that

00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:34,600
takes that simplicity and it and it

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:38,800
really adds a conceptual integrity to it

00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,450
you know do one thing well don't fret

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,070
about your performance you know one of

00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,190
the things that has been a consistent

00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:48,520
issue is you know how fast is Python is

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:50,050
it fast enough but really he said we can

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:52,209
optimize later it's more about getting

00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,339
it right for the programmer and I would

00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:56,589
say even for the community you know

00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:59,110
don't fight the environment try don't

00:16:56,589 --> 00:17:00,610
try perfection and it's okay to cut

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,179
corners sometimes as long as you do it

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:07,420
right indeed what's more is he actually

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:09,220
had some other some other concepts these

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,660
were sort of the time savers but it is

00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:14,170
some other things that really actually

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,300
added a lot of time don't tie it to a

00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,040
particular platform this is particularly

00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:20,350
interesting because one of the very

00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,790
first implementations of Python was on

00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:25,000
the amoeba distributed computing

00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:27,730
platform and it went very quickly from

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,130
there it was on unix it was an amoeba

00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,750
and it went very quickly to Mac and so

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:34,570
having it on these three disparate

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,520
platforms really made it easy to go

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:38,530
cross-platform early and that's one of

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,390
the reasons why Python actually has

00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:42,429
excellent Windows support relatively

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:45,220
early is because it wasn't really tied

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:48,540
to unix isms as deeply as a lot of other

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:51,970
as a lot of other languages at the time

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:55,030
you know don't bother with you know

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:57,970
don't bother with users the machines can

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,640
handle you know another one is this idea

00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:04,360
of the cross-platform code you know

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,950
don't cut off access to to make

00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,840
everything basic things should fit

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:10,030
everywhere and work everywhere but don't

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,890
cut off access to the platform this

00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:14,260
isn't sharp contrast to two languages

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:15,700
like Java where they had they said you

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,440
know we're going to re-implement stuff

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,809
everywhere instead of actually giving

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,090
access to the underlying system and

00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:22,320
you've got these strange-looking you

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,270
know

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,240
swt and awt and they're still fighting

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,580
it these days you know then they said

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,330
you know a complex system should have

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:37,870
multiple levels of extensibility you

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:40,540
know this this maximizes the opportunity

00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:41,920
for users it allows sophisticated users

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,230
to help themselves and this has really

00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:47,350
been the growth about the growth of the

00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,840
extensibility of the python platform you

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,820
know they talked about air should not be

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,070
fail at fatal as long as the virtual

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,570
machine itself is running correctly you

00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:58,930
should be able to recover from errors

00:18:55,570 --> 00:19:01,300
and in fact eat with air is not passing

00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:03,690
silently this is what led to exceptions

00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:06,540
being a core part of the interpreter and

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:10,270
and throughout the implementation and

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:13,390
finally you know it is the job of the

00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:15,580
Python interpreter to really get out of

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:19,300
the programmers way a core dump is never

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:21,040
the programmers fault you know gido

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:24,970
really got a lot of things right in

00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:27,040
those early days but python has always

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,550
been an opinion late opinionated

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,640
language somewhere between c and she'll

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:36,790
really trying to make things easy it was

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,530
always about the programmer and i would

00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:41,140
say even about the community at that

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:43,210
time it was the sweet spot for a lot of

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,300
applications and that's what led a lot

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,010
of early developers to Python but I'm

00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,470
not here actually to talk about the

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,290
technical implementation of Python well

00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,730
much but I'd like to talk about

00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:58,360
something else that guiteau got right

00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,370
and that is meaningfully or not he

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,580
succeeded also in creating a community

00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,280
around Python now there were a couple

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,830
key decisions that led to this you know

00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,840
there was the first was creating a Nilla

00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,520
and excellent language you know if there

00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:13,960
if you don't have an excellent language

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,490
if you don't have the base technical

00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,880
implementation there's nothing for

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,860
people to gather around and rally around

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,750
but Gita also released Python under an

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:25,030
open source language or under open

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,730
source license even before the term open

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,310
source was invented and he encouraged us

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:31,750
to have a sense of humor you know naming

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:35,170
the language itself after the Monty

00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:36,250
Python true another thing that they got

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,830
right relatively

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:43,390
early on was that Python had a sense of

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:46,840
values now who knows what happens when

00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:51,960
you go into the into the interpreter and

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:57,040
type import this how many have done that

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,620
almost everybody yeah you know these are

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:02,530
Tim Peters words about the values of

00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:04,480
Python you know and it appears that

00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,400
these were originally sent to python

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,470
laced engine in june nineteen ninety

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:15,820
nine under the subject the python way

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:17,320
but you know this is really the story

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,390
behind this is actually kind of funny

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,820
and because it all took place behind the

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:24,610
scenes it was actually about one of the

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,040
predecessors to this conference before

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:30,940
euro python and before pi cons of

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:33,160
various tribes there was the IPC the

00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:36,340
international python conference which

00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:40,420
was the which was being organized by for

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,850
tech for tech was a non-profit array

00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,640
under the corporation or national

00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,430
research research initiative CNRI where

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,780
we're ghetto and Frederick and Jeremy

00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,150
Hilton and Barry Warsaw and some others

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:54,640
had worked early on I think at this time

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,910
they had actually left for digital

00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,630
creation soon to become soap corporation

00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:03,970
but for tech was organizing IPC 10 and

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:05,800
they needed a slogan for the conference

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:07,930
and something that would fit on a

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,080
t-shirt that they could really put in

00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:15,310
and that the could really use as an

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:18,220
organizing effort and the Python labs

00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:20,260
team agreed to be able to agree to judge

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,730
all the different entries that came from

00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:26,920
the community now they put in they got

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:30,760
something like 500 entries and frankly

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,680
most of them were terrible Tim's exact

00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,030
words we're jeez Louise I can't look at

00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:38,320
these for more than five minutes without

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:39,910
my brain turning to mush but he still

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,730
managed to do an initial cut he cut it

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:44,650
down to about 130 entries and then he

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:47,650
went back and forth between him and

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:50,140
Barry Warsaw try each cutting half each

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:54,370
time trying to get to the ultimate

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:56,080
Group ultimate group and at last Barry

00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,430
was left to choose from the last two

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,980
entries which were by tough all you like

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:08,620
chewing is optional yes I said they were

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:10,660
awful and import this and and Barry

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,460
really like sort of the irreverent

00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:15,280
almost he said almost the sneering tone

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:19,390
of import this like come on and so

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,500
that's what it was but as soon as they

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:25,090
did that they said you know we really

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:26,440
have to implement this thing and so that

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,230
what they did is they turned off the

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,980
import check-ins they were just about to

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:34,900
release python 2.2 at this point it

00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:38,620
turned off the import check-ins and they

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:41,140
actually it put in the vista hi mom

00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,240
module and for just a little extra up

00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:48,100
you kick obfuscation they rocked her

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,680
team's the the the actual contents of it

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,440
and so when you import it it decodes it

00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:57,120
you know just brought 13 and print out

00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,460
the Zen of Python and they put this into

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,730
version after I pc10 to put this into

00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,460
version 2.2 point one of Python thus

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:10,200
also incidentally committing the sin of

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:13,510
adding new features in a point release

00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,880
but you know it was a long time before

00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:18,310
anyone actually found the the little

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:21,790
easter egg but this has become a core

00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:27,870
part of our thosse we have values we

00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:32,950
like Python code we behave pythonic Lee

00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:34,810
you know in the past 20 years we have

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,890
actually grown quite a bit I think we're

00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:43,660
grown a lot more than dito expected you

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:48,250
know he when he started it was he had a

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:51,220
small group Python labs was five or five

00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:52,990
people i think the core in the early

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:55,360
conferences in the earlier get early

00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,820
get-togethers had i think they started

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,100
with like 20 people or 30 people it

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,560
wasn't really until the 2000s where we

00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,789
really started exploding but based upon

00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,289
some of

00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:08,499
our surveys over the past couple of

00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:12,119
years there are hundreds of thousands of

00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:15,609
users using Python maybe even millions

00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,649
but explicitly using programming python

00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:20,200
as part of their jobs hundreds of

00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:21,669
thousands of developers and there are

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,440
thousands and thousands of companies

00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:25,539
that are letting and organizations that

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,639
are letting them do that you know that's

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:29,440
an amazing thing if you think of all the

00:25:27,639 --> 00:25:31,389
jobs if you think of all the people you

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,970
think of all the stuff that's going on

00:25:31,389 --> 00:25:39,039
because of guidos little language that's

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:42,039
quite it's quite something but python is

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,960
very very widely deployed as part of

00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,519
part of because of this much more

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,259
broadly than really any competitor

00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:52,119
language I would say a lot of competitor

00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:55,690
languages are our Lua article pearl Ruby

00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:57,429
things like that for example Python has

00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:59,229
become the de facto scripting language

00:25:57,429 --> 00:26:00,340
of the movie and animation industry I

00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:03,729
think we're going to be hearing more

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,349
about that little later today all of

00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,840
them use python is their glue language

00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:10,539
for their internal production pipeline

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,279
you know matt python has taken over for

00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:16,179
pearl as the standard language for

00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:20,320
bioinformatics it is the implementation

00:26:16,179 --> 00:26:24,179
language for actually two of the two of

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:27,359
the leading cloud network platforms it

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:29,019
most companies in the anon are in

00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,749
international financial infrastructure

00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:34,210
use python for their algorithmic trading

00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:37,210
you didn't know that but if you if you

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:40,659
take a look at especially any Python

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,789
conferences in London or in New York

00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:46,419
you'll get a whole bunch of guys from

00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:48,639
Goldman Sachs and you know and HSBC and

00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:50,619
these big banks it's because they do all

00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:54,009
their internal print our ethnic trading

00:26:50,619 --> 00:26:56,049
in Python a numpy and finally python has

00:26:54,009 --> 00:26:58,570
made huge gains in the educational

00:26:56,049 --> 00:27:02,440
spaces finally replacing java and

00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:06,700
goodness as as at the primary teaching

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:08,379
language for a lot of universities you

00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,470
know at the same time i think that we

00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:13,330
also found face a number of challenges

00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,769
you know this these are both technical

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:17,370
challenges and i would say they're

00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:19,480
almost market share challenges

00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:22,420
you know in terms of pure language

00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,940
competition javascript I think is a big

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:29,230
one it's moved from sort of a buggy

00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:32,049
browser only sort of inconsistent

00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:35,650
implementation to actually a fairly good

00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:38,380
competitor on the desktop in the server

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,900
space and particularly in mobile where

00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:45,150
where there are JavaScript runtimes for

00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:48,640
good JavaScript runtime for most mobile

00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:51,070
for most mobile platforms a couple of

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,929
years ago Lua released its second

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:57,160
generation it has had very high

00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:59,169
very high take-up rate particularly in

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,770
the games industry where they have been

00:27:59,169 --> 00:28:04,600
able to embed it very successfully

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,280
another one that is sort of up and

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,250
coming as Google's go language anyone

00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:11,110
played with go those are pretty nice

00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:13,299
language you know there are a number of

00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:15,580
places where pilot python is being

00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:17,980
replaced with go because of the gos

00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:22,390
concurrency and its ability to create

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:25,570
small fast easily deployable easily

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:30,190
deployable binaries that will just drop

00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:31,900
onto a system and run and this is this

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,150
is one of the things that frankly

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,610
deployment is a challenge for us you

00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:39,250
know Mobile is a challenge for us really

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:45,429
really high efficiently high efficiency

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:47,290
constrained spaces now in I think also

00:28:45,429 --> 00:28:49,120
in scientific computing you have things

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,070
like Julia I don't think Julie is going

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,010
to be a big deal but are especially is

00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,230
very widely known for its statistical

00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,690
excellence for its built-in graphical

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,950
capabilities that are better than ours

00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:06,100
you know now you may ask why do I care

00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:10,360
because we have Python and we love it as

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,610
growing the reason why is because it's

00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:15,100
important that we keep on growing or

00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:16,630
else we'll end up sort of eventually we

00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,000
can end up in the same place where small

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,700
talk and tickle are you know there was

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,710
an interesting thread and series of

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,600
articles of me in the tickle community

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:27,669
about a year ago where they talked about

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,370
the fact that no one creates rights

00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:32,730
tickle applications anymore anyone done

00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:32,730
tickle

00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:43,929
when was the last time anybody actually

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:46,330
did something new and tickle 96 99 these

00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:49,739
languages how about small talk anyone

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,739
done any small talk since the mid-80s

00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:56,889
the fact is these are fantastic

00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:59,169
languages but they had a lot of things

00:29:56,889 --> 00:30:02,279
going for them but because they have not

00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:06,700
grown they've died and if we don't

00:30:02,279 --> 00:30:09,639
effectively effectively counter and work

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,190
on our market share challenges the thing

00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:13,539
that we rely on and that is so important

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,999
to us not just the language but the

00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:19,529
community that is formed around it can

00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:26,889
die too that's why this is so important

00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:31,210
you know be we have technical challenges

00:30:26,889 --> 00:30:33,220
with with Python but I think that we are

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:37,139
also failing facing challenges

00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:37,139
associated with scaling our community

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:45,399
you know between 10 and 20 years ago

00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:47,320
just just hat being there in that sweet

00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:50,529
spot you know focusing on the program

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:54,519
focusing on the the programmer it really

00:30:50,529 --> 00:30:56,889
was enough there were there were a lot

00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:59,320
of those excellent design choices and I

00:30:56,889 --> 00:31:02,590
think like I said the Zen of Python was

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,879
so important in this in forming a

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:08,710
culture around programming helping us

00:31:05,879 --> 00:31:10,389
approach it as a unified community

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:15,519
there's really something special about

00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:17,529
this community you know the mission of

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,499
the Python software foundation overall

00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:22,629
is too i'm going to read it to promote

00:31:20,499 --> 00:31:24,580
protect and advance the python

00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:26,739
programming language and support and

00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,389
facilitate the growth of a diverse and

00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:31,840
international community of Python

00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:35,729
programmers you know those are important

00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,950
words those are really important words

00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:42,419
because if you look around us today a

00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,419
lot of us are getting older

00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:52,120
except for Anna uh-uh you know we need

00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:55,570
to start doing the things that will

00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:59,020
start to create the Python community of

00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:05,049
20 years from now so that when we are

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:07,360
coming when it is euro Python 2033 we

00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:10,350
have a group that looks at least like

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,030
this if not bigger if we don't have

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:15,280
groups this big in every single country

00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,010
here in Europe in every single country

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:20,890
in the world we need to start thinking

00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:23,500
about those things because it is not

00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:25,900
only our community from from our

00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:28,870
perspective if we don't build and grow

00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,820
this community then it'll go away and so

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:34,419
I'd like to talk today about some things

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:36,309
that we're doing to actually push things

00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:42,120
forward and create the you next 20 years

00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:44,500
of Python the community side first I

00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,950
want to talk about the psf code of

00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:50,679
conduct now we had judge dredd up here

00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:52,030
earlier endorsing the code of conduct

00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:57,490
I'm always happy to get an endorsement

00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:59,409
from the superhero I talked earlier

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,980
about the Zen of Python and how that has

00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:06,970
been so important in terms of helping us

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:09,070
decide what is pythonic as as a

00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:13,110
community that was really focused around

00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:15,789
code the code of conduct and I have to

00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:18,610
highlight Brian curtains role he's one

00:33:15,789 --> 00:33:20,470
of the directors of the psf he really he

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:25,090
really took this on it and pushed it

00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:28,330
forward he led the way and trying to

00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:31,059
help us make not only our community more

00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:32,710
cleaner better more pythonic you know

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,710
you see that there is such a thing as a

00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,539
pythonic community as well you see here

00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:39,250
in the efforts of giovanni and lorenzo

00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:41,890
and all those people again like I

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:44,679
mentioned in the yellow shirts you see

00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,870
it in the presentations here at euro

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,429
python you see it in the hallway track

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:52,090
and the conversations that happen

00:33:48,429 --> 00:33:55,240
between people and the interactions

00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:57,460
it's with respect it's with appreciation

00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:01,150
it's with an open mind and really being

00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:02,230
ready to learn but we've been over the

00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:04,600
past year or two we've been really

00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:07,690
trying to capture what makes our Python

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,369
community different as well and I think

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,679
that that has been captured very well in

00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:16,210
the in the official psf code of conduct

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,339
and it is Python community is made up of

00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,560
members from around the globe with a

00:34:18,339 --> 00:34:22,300
diverse set of skills personalities and

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,679
experiences it's through these

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,270
differences that our community

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,399
experiences great successes and

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:28,750
continued growth when you're working

00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,849
with members of the community we

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:32,050
encourage you to follow these guidelines

00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:33,580
which help steer our interactions is

00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,550
strive to keep Python a positive

00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:38,879
successful and growing community if

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:40,899
pytho the Python community is open

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,280
members of community are open to

00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:44,950
collaboration whether it's on PEP's

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,690
patches problems or otherwise we're

00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,270
responsive to constructive comment and

00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:51,280
criticism as the member experiences and

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:53,109
skill sets of other members contribute

00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,760
to the whole of our efforts we're

00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:56,440
accepting of all who wish to take part

00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,730
in our activities fostering an

00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,530
environment where anyone can participate

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,530
and where everyone can make a difference

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:06,430
considerate members of the community are

00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:08,500
considered of their peers other python

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,330
users we're thoughtful when addressing

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,310
the efforts of others keeping in mind

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:13,740
that off times the labor was completed

00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,000
simply for the good of the community

00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,950
we're attentive in our communications

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,520
whether in person or online we're

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:23,530
tactful when approaching different views

00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:25,420
respectful members of the community are

00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,400
respectful we're respectful of others

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,140
their positions their skills their

00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,640
commitments and their efforts or

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,010
spectral the volunteer efforts that

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,750
permeate the Python community we're

00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,400
respectful the processes set forth in

00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,160
the community and we work within them

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,190
when we disagree we're courteous and

00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,020
raising our issues overall we're good to

00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:46,390
each other we contribute to this

00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:48,640
community not because we have to but

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:52,200
because we want to if we remember that

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,200
these guidelines will come naturally

00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:58,300
this I just read that that was sort of a

00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:02,339
long block of text but that is the Zen

00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:04,970
of Python for our community it is about

00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:08,400
really make

00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:10,859
it is about coalescing all the things

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,009
that make the Python community great and

00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:15,839
helping it put and putting it down in

00:36:14,009 --> 00:36:18,119
words so that we can point it to it

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,150
point each other to it so that we can

00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,479
use it as a touchstone and as we work

00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:28,319
back and forth we can help each other be

00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:30,900
better it's about being the best people

00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:35,670
that we can be and being the best

00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:38,430
community that we can be you know my

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,779
favorite line there is overall work good

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:41,339
to each other we contribute to the

00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:44,640
community not because we have to but

00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:48,299
because we want to every single one of

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,519
us I think that applies to us here you

00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:53,940
know they always say that python is the

00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:57,150
community is the language with batteries

00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:58,619
included and that's definitely true you

00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,930
know I know there have been so many

00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,759
times when I when I've just looked and

00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:05,130
wow they're in the standard library has

00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:07,440
been exactly the thing I need but it's

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:10,319
more than that Python is the language

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,529
with community included that makes all

00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:16,319
the difference tekken thing i want to

00:37:13,529 --> 00:37:19,049
talk about is education now as I

00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:22,499
mentioned some of us not all of us some

00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:25,920
of us are getting older and we need to

00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:27,719
we need to think about where are the

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,039
next generation of Python programmers

00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:32,099
coming from and I'm telling you it's

00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,049
going to come from education I want to

00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:35,880
tell you about two interesting things

00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:39,269
that have happened over this past year

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,190
which i think really bode well for the

00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:43,979
growth and development of the next 20

00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:47,849
years of python vs i'd like to talk

00:37:43,979 --> 00:37:52,849
about Sam burger does anyone recognize

00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:58,739
this guy it's Sam is an 11 year old I

00:37:52,849 --> 00:38:02,519
think he's 11 maybe 12 from South Africa

00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:05,789
and he had gone to every single Python

00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:08,249
it every single computer thing class and

00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:10,710
and and club and everything that was

00:38:08,249 --> 00:38:14,309
offered where he was and he had

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:16,529
outstripped them all and so he reached

00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:17,700
it he and his dad reached out to us at

00:38:16,529 --> 00:38:18,840
the psf and said

00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:22,830
is there anything that you can do to

00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:25,230
help us well we we actually brought him

00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:29,010
and his dad we brought him to the the

00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:31,430
most recent pycon over in in santa clara

00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:34,710
in california in the united states and

00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:37,200
he was actually able to attend the

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:40,080
professional level tutorials and the

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,890
classes and he was able to interact with

00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,560
all the people they're learning just as

00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:51,570
the entire just as the community here

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:54,180
does it people like Sam are where the

00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:57,030
next generation of Python leaders are

00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,740
coming from and he even this is in the

00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,950
poster session he actually presented a

00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:04,590
poster session now i cropped this

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:19,680
because anyone know who he's presenting

00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:21,750
to you know if there's one you know this

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,930
would if there's if there's anything

00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:26,910
that should that that describes the next

00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:32,370
20 years of Python I think that picture

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:34,500
and also like to talk a second about the

00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:38,490
raspberry pi have anybody had a chance

00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,380
to play with a raspberry pi they're cool

00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:43,260
little computers aren't they they're

00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:46,650
really fun you know had a chance to talk

00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:48,810
with Ed been upton a little bit and he

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,600
talked about how the pie and raspberry

00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:55,620
pi actually stood for Python you know

00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:58,050
he's neat since needed to to defend his

00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:01,380
spelling and changing the spelling a

00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:04,020
number of times he talked about his

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:05,490
vision and when all the way back to some

00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:08,160
of the acorn computers are the early

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,830
basic computers so when you boot it up

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,470
computer in the early 80s or even up

00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:18,510
through like 1990 what was the first

00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:21,270
thing that you saw basic a prompt and

00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,880
then what would you need to do you would

00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:26,670
need to type stuff so the very first

00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:28,500
thing that you would do is essentially

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:30,640
start to interact with the computer

00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,440
would start to program it

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,780
and if you wanted to run some kind of

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,600
other program you needed to make an

00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,850
affirmative decision to do something

00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,520
else you needed to run some other

00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,320
program or load something else but the

00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,780
very first thing that you would do when

00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,930
when it came up was it would present you

00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,550
with a pro with a programming prompt

00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:54,520
that was an incredibly powerful thing

00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:56,110
because what it did is it created an

00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:01,380
entire generation of people who

00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:03,970
understood that you know what it is

00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,280
these computers are tools there are

00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:09,010
things that we can use to be creative to

00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,380
build tools to make things better for

00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:14,290
society that's an incredibly powerful

00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:17,410
thing that you can teach just by making

00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:19,150
it so that there's a prompt a

00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:23,560
programming problem that's the first

00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:25,210
thing that you see now these days most

00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,400
of the computers that we interact with

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,560
our either embedded or they are really

00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:31,210
designed around consumption which is

00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:34,810
fine you know everyone likes to play

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:38,110
game or watch a movie or do Facebook or

00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:41,230
be social or things like that but

00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:43,630
there's something really empowering

00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:46,270
about understanding that the computer is

00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,630
a tool and you won't break it by playing

00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:52,690
with it you know one of the things that

00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:58,750
the psf has really been advancing is the

00:41:52,690 --> 00:42:00,370
idea of young coders we had a this is

00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:02,680
something that's now happening on in

00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:04,390
three different countries in the UK in

00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,390
the United States and I was talking to

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:12,120
mark Andre actually in Germany about

00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:16,840
advancing the the use of Python to teach

00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:20,380
students to teach students how to use

00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:23,800
computers like to talk about two things

00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:27,010
in that regard first more formula more

00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,860
formally at PyCon UK last year there was

00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:32,530
a teacher named ms Philbin or miss P as

00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:34,300
she goes by who teaches ICT I don't know

00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:39,599
what I see T stands for anyone from the

00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:41,799
UK here taken

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,819
information and communication technology

00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:49,329
and so she has her website ICT with ms p

00:42:44,819 --> 00:42:51,009
uh that she she put up and she's got one

00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:54,160
of these raspberry PI's and she started

00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:56,619
putting together educational materials

00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,309
about how to teach some of these

00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:03,369
programs the educational objectives for

00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:05,890
the UK in Python and this is her

00:43:03,369 --> 00:43:07,779
personal website it's not really she

00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:09,490
didn't advertise this or anything just

00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:13,119
said she started getting tens of

00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:17,200
thousands of hits just for her personal

00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,390
website and so she reached out to the

00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,660
pike on UK society and that they brought

00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:25,660
her in and it led to a collaboration

00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:28,930
where we now have Python programmers

00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:32,319
helping helping create some of the

00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:35,559
helping create some of these educational

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:38,140
curriculum modules so that people can

00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:40,420
teach in fact Python is being considered

00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,160
and I think is in the lead to be the

00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:48,609
official teaching language for all of

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:50,619
the UK here in the United States you

00:43:48,609 --> 00:43:53,019
know we did a thing at PyCon called

00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:56,529
young coders where we brought in kids

00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:58,480
from 11 to 13 and then 13 and older this

00:43:56,529 --> 00:44:00,249
is actually picture someone brought

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,210
actually or even their four-year-old and

00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:08,170
help them and they went through and they

00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:11,069
taught these kids to play to start

00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:14,049
programming using the Raspberry Pi and

00:44:11,069 --> 00:44:17,259
it was amazing because these kids who

00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:19,150
are grown up in the age of being

00:44:17,259 --> 00:44:22,569
delivered and really consumption

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:25,660
oriented culture when they realized that

00:44:22,569 --> 00:44:28,920
they could type things into this

00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:31,059
computer and make the LED spotlight up

00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,789
you should have seen their eyes light up

00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:35,920
it was amazing they would sit there they

00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:38,920
had programmer face on how many of you

00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,039
know a programmer face and there was an

00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:45,190
entire group of kids who came back the

00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:46,599
first day second day glued to the

00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,489
computers you know one of the things

00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,559
that's interesting that's fun on the

00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:51,630
Raspberry Pi is they have a version of

00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,210
Minecraft that

00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:56,580
actually scriptable with Python and so

00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:59,130
all these kids who'd play Minecraft in

00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,680
who are used to lock you know drag a

00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:09,630
block block you show them that you can

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:11,520
do or four I in twenty block you know

00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:13,790
and it built through all for you you

00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,110
know they were excited about that too

00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:20,010
you know they could build some build

00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:23,700
things faster than anybody else but the

00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:25,500
point is we that was so successful that

00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,860
we got inquiries from the department of

00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:31,050
education in the United States for the

00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:32,640
entire country asking about how we could

00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:34,380
support this we've got inquiries from

00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,380
Mexico we got inquiries from all over

00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,060
the world in fact about taking this and

00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:42,150
so what we're doing is we're taking this

00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,380
young coders get to curriculum we're

00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:46,740
working it out and we're going to be

00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:51,120
placing it on python org as a seer as a

00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:56,550
way for people to take this and and to

00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:58,890
teach young kids Python finally I'd like

00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:03,570
to talk about the future of the psf and

00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:05,190
a little bit about python org now one of

00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,140
the things that's not very surprising

00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:09,390
when you think about us as programmers

00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:13,410
is that we like to build stuff and so

00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:18,350
when we've had our current website for a

00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:22,650
little while and naturally when we

00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:25,770
decided to build it back in 2004-2005

00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:28,380
2006 we decided you know nothing quite

00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,740
made it exactly like we wanted and so it

00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:33,810
is this very weird you you check it out

00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:35,220
and you build the website and you know

00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,080
at one point I think we actually have

00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:40,020
had pieces of the website that were

00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:45,240
backed off of rcs if you've worked with

00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:47,550
RCS I'm very sorry um and so I think it

00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,110
looks great but one of the things i'd

00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:52,680
like to introduce to you today is

00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:55,600
actually the new python.org there are

00:46:52,680 --> 00:47:06,490
two things that I think are great about

00:46:55,600 --> 00:47:08,800
the yeah so the new pilot org is built

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,540
on a responsive set of web site of

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,100
templates in fact it's mobile first so

00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:14,800
that only sends down the information

00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,210
that you need so if you want to see it

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,630
you can actually go to preview

00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:21,730
python.org and hit it right now and so

00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:24,190
used to try resizing your browser and

00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:25,720
it's completely dynamic you know there

00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:28,780
was an amazing amount of thought and

00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,370
design that went into trying to reflect

00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,040
the Python community and our

00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:35,350
sensibilities and trying to present us

00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:37,420
with with a serious but elegant visual

00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:40,030
identity you know there are links to

00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:44,020
sister sites you know the docs pi PI

00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:45,790
jobs I mentioned the education one of

00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:47,680
the things that we have planned there we

00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:49,990
haven't implemented it yet it's actually

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:52,090
going to be split into two or it's going

00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,310
to have on one side so you want to learn

00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,710
Python it's going to point to all the

00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:58,690
various places where there are courses

00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,880
about Python on the other side is going

00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,280
to be so you want to teach Python and is

00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,220
going to have curated content for

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,740
teachers at all different levels

00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:12,100
addressing all different countries

00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:14,710
trying to help them teach it the main

00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:16,090
navigation there goes to two more casual

00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:19,540
users who just want to know where to go

00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:21,160
and it allows people who need to look

00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:24,880
work for success stories to go to the

00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:28,630
blog etc on the back end the new pilot

00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,550
or gets built on Jango the whole website

00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:33,340
is editable through the web and will

00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:36,670
support offline editing as well and the

00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:40,030
cert via HTTPS you know everything that

00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:42,700
went into designing the new pod org was

00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:47,440
actually about making it easy for the

00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:49,360
community to get involved um because it

00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,520
would be every time there was a choice

00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,870
it was what would be make it the easiest

00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,810
for the part their community to

00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:58,990
participate in to support to build over

00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:00,850
the next 10 15 years you know we're

00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,100
building in a community directory where

00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:05,890
people can tie their pirate or to github

00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:08,090
meetup bitbucket Twitter their own

00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:10,910
individual feeds etc

00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:15,490
all this is also completely written in

00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:22,490
Python 33 derb from the ground up there

00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:24,860
now the important thing here is I'll

00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:27,640
also like to talk about one important

00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:30,610
thing that this is going to implement

00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:36,740
how many people here are currently

00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:39,470
members of the psf so if you over the

00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,650
patent one of the main things that we're

00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:44,180
doing we've done over the past this just

00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:46,220
happened over the past three months and

00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:49,880
we're work we're working on implementing

00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:53,600
it is that we said you know what the psf

00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,420
is not broad enough it is not it's not

00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:58,760
inclusive now it should include every

00:49:56,420 --> 00:50:00,860
single person who attends a conference

00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,550
like this a person who wants to ally

00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:08,780
themselves with the Python community and

00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:12,820
so in in early April there was a vote

00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:15,890
among the current membership and we are

00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:18,050
completely redoing the membership model

00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,820
for the Python software foundation so

00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:24,280
that it will be moving to an entirely

00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:27,620
open membership and starting later today

00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:29,240
you will actually be able to go on to

00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:31,340
this and if you scroll down it'll say

00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:34,040
become a member of the psf you'll be

00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:37,580
able to sign up that that functionality

00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:39,920
is going live today tell you we want to

00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,430
have every single member of the Python

00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,470
community to be a member of the PSM and

00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:49,070
so there will be those instead of having

00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:51,740
be invitation only it is going to be the

00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:53,930
home for every single person who goes to

00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:57,020
conference like this who uses Python in

00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:59,090
their work uses Python to play you know

00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:01,220
we're going to recognize those who put

00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:04,550
together put in additional efforts

00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:06,320
through through funding development

00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,750
activities who contribute code or

00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,630
documentation or tests we're going to

00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:16,940
recognize those who spend time

00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:18,290
organizing but fundamentally we want you

00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:21,610
to sign up and we want you to be a

00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:24,830
member of the psf because the psf

00:51:21,610 --> 00:51:27,650
it's changing to be your home what's

00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:30,650
more internationally everything we're

00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:34,430
going to be inviting every formally

00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:37,820
organized group to be an affiliate of

00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:39,770
the psf or bringing it in under or

00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,930
inviting them to be sort of our work one

00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:44,570
of our working groups so that the things

00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:47,840
that you do are going to be part of the

00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:49,790
broader Python ecosystem and you'll be

00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,220
able to when you sign up you're going to

00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:54,350
be able to see the hundreds of thousands

00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:56,170
of Python users all over the world and

00:51:54,350 --> 00:52:03,070
connect with them and work with them

00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:06,350
just through through pi org you know

00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:09,650
this is one this is the most significant

00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:11,900
change that we've had in the psf in in

00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:16,970
the Python community since the formation

00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:18,440
of the psf about 14 years ago because

00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:22,730
what we're fundamentally doing is we're

00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:24,740
saying we need each of you I said a

00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,080
couple times this is really all about

00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,910
the community this is about you this is

00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:34,160
about building that 20 years of Python

00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:37,250
and we need every one of your help but I

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:39,470
know that as we do it as we reach as we

00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,930
connect with each other as we reach out

00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:44,390
to the next generation that each one of

00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:47,560
the bet we will be able to make Python

00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:52,270
the best language and the best community

00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:52,270
for the next 50 years not just next 20

00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,690
that's it

00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:16,150
good questions there we go yeah i wrote

00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:19,530
my question down at that time when you

00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:22,000
mention the code of conduct and that a

00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:25,930
community member is open respectful and

00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:28,660
considerate i I noticed that you said

00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:32,050
consider it and open towards other

00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:35,350
Python programmers are we not in general

00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:37,270
more globally considerate also towards

00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:41,590
other languages I mean that is a concern

00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:44,340
for some some communities are just where

00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:47,380
they can't cope with other communities I

00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:49,680
think that that's a great point we are

00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:54,010
open and considered because you know

00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:55,570
toward all people honestly and frankly

00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,190
there are so many things that we have to

00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:59,260
learn one of the things that we've had a

00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:01,240
various python conference is is we've

00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:03,070
had like dynamic languages conferences

00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:06,100
where we brought in people who've done

00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:08,200
small talk and lua and JavaScript and

00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:10,630
Ruby and we've had a conference about

00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,780
what are the things that we can eat to

00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:16,570
learn from each other so we absolutely

00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:20,470
we think that we have the best language

00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:23,260
but you know and and and we can do that

00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:25,650
but we are it's important to be

00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:30,280
respectful because you know nothing is

00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:33,550
sewing when you have so many options out

00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,830
there really having the community be

00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:38,140
there and supportive and available makes

00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:41,260
all the difference you know python

00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:42,340
actually has the large as a community I

00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:46,870
think that we have the largest

00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:49,300
percentage of female programmers in any

00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:51,010
open source language community and that

00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:55,960
is because we've spent the past several

00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:58,000
years trying Express trying to be open

00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:01,090
and to provide mentorship opportunities

00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,470
and to be accepting of people people

00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:05,260
wherever they are whatever they're doing

00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:07,210
and as a result for example at some of

00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,640
our recent conferences we've had twenty

00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:12,700
percent women I did I don't know exactly

00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:15,460
what the what the percentage is for

00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,300
Europe icon here but it seems like we do

00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:20,170
also have a parent

00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:24,280
here that's where open to everyone other

00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:33,430
questions even from the room upstairs if

00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:35,620
they can hear me yes one second one

00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:43,420
second but there is everybody can hear

00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:45,460
otherwise Thank You Damian Campbell of n

00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,190
thought I'd like to ask the question

00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:49,930
that has been asked every euro Python

00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:51,550
for several years depending upon the

00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,550
speaker who's been up on the on the

00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:57,100
stage it is related to the relationships

00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:59,830
with in Python programming and very

00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:03,400
relevant to the talk here and that is

00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:05,560
could we ask the the audience a show of

00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:09,220
hands for those that are actually

00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:11,260
writing applications in Python 3 as

00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:16,930
opposed to those who are still working

00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:20,800
in Python 2 very simply hyphen 30 it's

00:56:16,930 --> 00:56:23,950
more than last year but not that many ok

00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:25,420
interesting many thanks you know with

00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:30,610
regard to python 3 we are going through

00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:34,870
a transition ah as you all know when

00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:37,180
when we when we when Python 3 was and

00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:39,550
wasn't as we anticipated that there

00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:41,650
would be a five year transition we're

00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:44,800
about three years into that we're on

00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:47,710
schedule and what's more is what's more

00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:50,680
is that with Python 33 especially and

00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:53,710
the compatibility be between 2 dot 7 and

00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:58,840
33 and the new porting forward of major

00:56:53,710 --> 00:57:01,420
libraries actually far more than half of

00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:05,080
the top packages on pipe i support

00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,970
python 33 and what's more is i think

00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:09,430
like seventy or eighty percent have

00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:13,050
declared their intention to support 33

00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:15,940
onward you can have a single source a

00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:19,390
single source strategy for for doing

00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:21,790
both 2.6 and above as well as 33 it

00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:25,039
makes especially easy for 2007 and about

00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:27,989
2 dot 7 and 3 23 plus

00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,999
this language cycle that wearing right

00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:32,009
now in the three top three to release is

00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:33,899
very exciting because this is one where

00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:35,579
we're actually crossing over we've made

00:57:33,899 --> 00:57:38,099
more than fifty percent in terms of

00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:40,469
people who are planning on and who are

00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:50,329
starting to work in 33 either partially

00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:50,329
or exclusively we go

00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:02,319
while we're doing the whole show of

00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:04,500
hands things like to show of hands for

00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:16,000
people who it's their first Python

00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:19,450
conference attendance awesome welcome to

00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,040
all of you I have a question actually so

00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:27,160
but by opening up the membership of the

00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,869
psf to be an open group always gone how

00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:31,180
is the decision-making process going to

00:58:28,869 --> 00:58:32,500
be because usually when you increase the

00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,599
number of people that can decide on

00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,950
something you quadratically increase the

00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:38,050
time that they spend discussing

00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:39,880
something that's actually a good point

00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:46,240
and we spent a lot of time debating this

00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:50,050
not not surprising um the way that it's

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:51,609
going to work is that is that we're

00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:53,560
making the basic membership open to

00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:56,619
everybody that says you know if you want

00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:59,200
to say I am a member of the Python

00:58:56,619 --> 00:59:00,880
community I support I support you know

00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:03,640
these values that support sort of a

00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:06,490
pythonic approach to both both community

00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:10,599
and code you can you can become a member

00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:13,720
and if you want to stay there then then

00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:15,160
that's great but then we also want

00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,599
everybody we understand that there are

00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:19,540
different ways in which people will

00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:21,310
participate and would end and ways in

00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:23,230
which they'd like to contribute some

00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:26,410
people like organizing things other

00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:30,130
people don't some people like writing

00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:33,550
code other people are well right time

00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:35,319
then text tests or doctor and they just

00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:36,609
want to be in it and so everybody has

00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:37,869
different things that they contribute

00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:40,450
that's what part of what makes a

00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:43,030
community great what happens is that if

00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:44,800
you wish to advance in the Python

00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:48,280
Software Foundation you'll have the

00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:51,099
opportunity to do it by by contributing

00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:54,700
code test stocks things like that by

00:59:51,099 --> 00:59:57,550
organizing by supporting and funding and

00:59:54,700 --> 01:00:01,240
then for those who put together those

00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:03,250
who have demonstrated a commitment to

01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:05,650
the python software foundation by

01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:08,020
putting two forth you know five to ten

01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:10,109
hours a month of work they're going to

01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:13,829
be eligible for voting privileges

01:00:10,109 --> 01:00:15,839
and if you are doing that you'll receive

01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:17,460
an email each year or it could say would

01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:19,890
you like to also participate sort of in

01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:22,289
the administration of psf if you say no

01:00:19,890 --> 01:00:24,569
all right no problem if you say yes then

01:00:22,289 --> 01:00:26,730
you'll have the opportunity to to vote

01:00:24,569 --> 01:00:28,680
on certain things and then you could

01:00:26,730 --> 01:00:30,089
there will be different portions of the

01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:31,619
administration will be delegated to

01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:35,160
whatever we're calling working groups

01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:37,230
where it you seek to isolate the people

01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,839
who are really committed and who are

01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:41,789
interested in working on stuff and and

01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:43,829
give them the final say because really

01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:46,140
this it's very similar to how open

01:00:43,829 --> 01:00:48,239
source works an open source a lot of

01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:50,930
people can complain and can do this but

01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:54,019
who really controls how the code looks

01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:56,759
person who's writing the code right here

01:00:54,019 --> 01:00:58,890
it's the people who are going to have

01:00:56,759 --> 01:01:00,359
the opportunity to vote and who are

01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:01,829
going to have the opportunity to weigh

01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:03,539
in on different issues are the people

01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:05,789
who demonstrated commitment to the

01:01:03,539 --> 01:01:08,160
Pythons community in by doing one of

01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:09,480
these things and who have stood up and

01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:12,569
said I'm interested in this particular

01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:18,450
issue I'd like to I'd like to contribute

01:01:12,569 --> 01:01:20,849
to it and so by helping focus the two to

01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:27,059
your question specifically by helping

01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:29,099
focus the the decision-making power in

01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:31,170
those who really have a stake in it and

01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:34,380
who have demonstrated an interest in it

01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:36,660
whereas and helping them work with other

01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:38,670
people who work with other people who

01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,440
have a similar stake we think that we

01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:42,059
can we concur out because not

01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,279
everybody's going to be interested and

01:01:42,059 --> 01:01:46,710
weighing in on every aspect of psf

01:01:44,279 --> 01:01:48,180
policy and then of course at the we're

01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:50,009
going to have the board of directors in

01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,140
various coordinating groups who are

01:01:50,009 --> 01:01:53,940
overseeing at all then when a working

01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:56,579
group puts to get put support something

01:01:53,940 --> 01:02:00,930
forward it'll be depending on what kind

01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:03,509
of what what kind of thing it is it

01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:06,029
could go to either the member voting

01:02:03,509 --> 01:02:07,559
members to for approval or up or down or

01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:11,029
it could go to the board depending on

01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:11,029
you know what's needed

01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:21,330
all right then I've got well hey man

01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:23,520
thanks for a great talk um so I guess a

01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:24,930
lot of us maybe came to Python from

01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:27,090
another language and one of the reasons

01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:28,320
that we love it is because I mean so

01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:30,030
much better than what we came from I

01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,160
came from you know a bit of JavaScript a

01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:33,300
bit of PHP bit of Java and you know

01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,220
there's that feeling of god what a

01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:37,470
relief yeah you know this is what it

01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:38,850
should be like wonderful so it's maybe

01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:43,050
you love it because it's an alternative

01:02:38,850 --> 01:02:45,330
to something is there a danger that if

01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:48,180
Python becomes the default language in

01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:50,670
schools and for learning programming the

01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:52,260
suddenly it becomes a bit square so it

01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:53,730
you know it becomes the establishment it

01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:55,290
becomes the thing you learned first it

01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,430
becomes boring and so all the kids

01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:57,960
they're going to grow up with Python I

01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,950
go see it as this sort of old thing and

01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,940
they're going to be looking for

01:02:58,950 --> 01:03:02,520
something new and we're going to lose

01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:05,610
that sort of novelty value or that kind

01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:11,190
of underdog rebellious kind of spirit by

01:03:05,610 --> 01:03:12,720
being to square the maybe it doesn't

01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,930
matter yeah you know that that's a good

01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,700
question I would honestly say the fact

01:03:14,930 --> 01:03:20,610
the time when Python was rebellious was

01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:23,970
probably ten years ago we're a little

01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:27,900
bit square right now I'm square and

01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:34,250
proud of it the i would think that

01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:37,380
really when you look at it it what we're

01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:41,610
it's all about the things that we use to

01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:44,190
attract people to to python and if and

01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:48,270
if what we have is being the new shiny

01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:50,070
thing and being rebellious that's not

01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:52,200
going to last very long and you know the

01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:53,520
cool kids moved on to ruby and then they

01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:56,580
moved on to node and then move on to

01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:59,040
something else that move on to something

01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:01,950
else next i think that we offer

01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:05,610
different things we offer solid code we

01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:08,310
offer elegance we offer simplicity and

01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:10,020
we offer a community and those are the

01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:12,690
things that if we really double down on

01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:15,960
them and we emphasize them people will

01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:17,730
learn other other languages and they'll

01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:21,110
be better for it and then they'll come

01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:21,110
back to us because we have those things

01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:34,580
nobody will say PHP what a relief my

01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:38,510
name is moshe Goldstein from the Hebrew

01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:42,410
University in Jerusalem I want it two

01:04:38,510 --> 01:04:47,690
points to to say first the controversy

01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:50,090
of three against to write Python 3

01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:53,110
against peyton to i think personally

01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:56,720
that it was at the beginning at least

01:04:53,110 --> 01:05:00,790
the release of three it wasn't able to

01:04:56,720 --> 01:05:05,000
break compatibility because i personally

01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:09,680
wrote thousands of lines of code in

01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,320
Python to point something and I am NOT

01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:15,320
ready to waste my time in the

01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:19,760
translation non bug free translation

01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:22,370
from two to three and i think that most

01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,520
of the people here that don't write in

01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:30,920
three one of the reasons is that because

01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:33,590
the incompatibility a causes that that

01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:36,560
if you trances even if with the program

01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:40,700
two to three that this is not bug free

01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:45,890
the translation a is a problem it's a

01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:49,190
problem I continue to use now 2.7 2.7 31

01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:53,390
or 32 what you say what you want but I

01:05:49,190 --> 01:06:00,110
don't I now actually I I am NOT ready to

01:05:53,390 --> 01:06:05,510
to make the decision to translate all my

01:06:00,110 --> 01:06:09,940
code to to an aversion 3 and you have a

01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:16,280
real a real solution to to break that

01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:18,530
that the area on on that and that is my

01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:21,650
first point they have a second point but

01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:24,580
please say your answer to that I think

01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:28,760
that a lot of a lot of the work around

01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:31,790
33 in particular was about making the

01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,530
transition between two dot seven and

01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:34,370
three dots very easier there were a

01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:36,470
number of things

01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:39,950
were put in specifically for

01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:42,980
compatibility back with 2.7 that make it

01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:46,640
actually really relatively easy to

01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:49,340
support both I've been involved in a

01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:51,530
number of porting efforts where people

01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:55,430
said that's it I mean there was one

01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:57,920
fairly substantial prone area of piece

01:06:55,430 --> 01:07:01,700
of code they required literally a single

01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:02,720
change in order to make it work in to

01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:06,710
got seven and three dot three

01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:12,920
simultaneously so I guess my my response

01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:14,000
to you is that the the efforts that you

01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,910
have that the concerns that you have

01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,580
have been heard and a lot of the work

01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:21,290
has been put in particularly in 33 in

01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:23,690
particular I'd encourage you to look at

01:07:21,290 --> 01:07:25,100
that to make it so that you will be able

01:07:23,690 --> 01:07:27,410
to have that single source that will

01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,180
work on 2007 so you don't lose that and

01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:33,920
will be forward compatible with three

01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:37,600
doctor as well on my thank you my second

01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:40,340
point is about programming education I

01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:42,140
teach programming in the Hebrew

01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:45,770
University and also in the Jerusalem

01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:48,560
College of Technology and this was this

01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:51,530
academic year was the first year that

01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:55,850
the Natural Sciences in the Hebrew

01:07:51,530 --> 01:08:00,010
University we taught Python as the first

01:07:55,850 --> 01:08:02,930
language for a first semester first year

01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:06,580
students of non computer science

01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:09,820
students and the next year all the

01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:15,430
Biosciences departments will have a

01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:21,680
required course of programming in Python

01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:24,830
excellent and also the computer science

01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:29,750
department decided for next year to have

01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:33,580
the first a a course in programming from

01:08:29,750 --> 01:08:38,960
they they move from Java to fight

01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:42,260
excellent and I I I think that it was it

01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:45,020
will be a good thing that this

01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:47,359
organization would have maybe that you

01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:49,790
have a young new for

01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:53,290
I am the first time that I in in this

01:08:49,790 --> 01:08:57,710
conference and and I will be very very

01:08:53,290 --> 01:09:01,600
happy to to be a member of psf now to

01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:04,699
have something like a task force in

01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:09,319
programming education especially in a

01:09:04,699 --> 01:09:11,029
programming college education talk to me

01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:19,130
after because i think i'd love to get

01:09:11,029 --> 01:09:21,560
you involved I like to share the from

01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:23,239
video actually on the two versus three

01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:24,920
version of Python so I only started

01:09:23,239 --> 01:09:27,799
programming in Python like six months

01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,779
ago and so I've not experienced

01:09:27,799 --> 01:09:33,679
whatsoever and that whole version was

01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:36,080
320 or what's 303 hows about and but the

01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:38,420
problem my case is that I am writing

01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,830
applications in solaris and the last

01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,020
version in slides at the moment is to

01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:44,179
the 6th in a plate 1 and actually I need

01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:46,219
to deploy it in solaris 10 which is not

01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:48,710
the main server a microbe which is an

01:09:46,219 --> 01:09:51,049
even older version so my only options

01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:52,900
were was was to in this case so my

01:09:51,049 --> 01:09:56,330
question would be is there any and

01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:58,550
movement inside the psf to actually map

01:09:56,330 --> 01:10:00,530
the default versions of Python in all

01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:03,679
the different platforms and maybe

01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:06,080
approach those communities to try and

01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:09,139
figure out why are they being holding

01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:12,409
back or why why is what is stopping them

01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:14,989
to adopt the new version yes we are

01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:18,139
working with that we've had we've had

01:10:14,989 --> 01:10:20,510
the most success we've had the most

01:10:18,139 --> 01:10:22,760
success in with Mac they're going to be

01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:31,010
shipping with Python 3 in one of the

01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:32,389
upcoming releases wait I think it's

01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:33,679
going to be at least three top three or

01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:38,929
depending on their schedule maybe three

01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:42,440
dot 4 and then with a boon to is going

01:10:38,929 --> 01:10:44,389
to be making python3 the default Python

01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:49,190
in what in their next upcoming long-term

01:10:44,389 --> 01:10:52,070
support release fedora and red hat

01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:54,290
they've got a very long support cycle

01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:56,030
but there we've engaged with them in

01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:59,719
terms of working on the transition as

01:10:56,030 --> 01:11:00,989
well you know solaris is very difficult

01:10:59,719 --> 01:11:04,920
because it's

01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:06,809
to a certain extent been kind of you

01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:11,610
know Oracle isn't really doing much with

01:11:06,809 --> 01:11:13,760
it so you know we can we can reach out

01:11:11,610 --> 01:11:15,300
we can reach out to them but

01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,320
unfortunately that's going to be a

01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:21,269
harder one because the extent that the

01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:23,760
platform is not being developed forward

01:11:21,269 --> 01:11:27,510
very much a lot of times what I've seen

01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:31,349
people do is to crew is to actually put

01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:34,349
you can you can it you can compile the

01:11:31,349 --> 01:11:38,179
binary and when you put for put in your

01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:41,030
own program you put in your own program

01:11:38,179 --> 01:11:44,329
libraries etc just put in an updated

01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:44,329
interpreter as well

01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:57,460
oh my name is Lucia Lucia from working

01:11:52,750 --> 01:12:00,880
from Intel and I wanted to address a

01:11:57,460 --> 01:12:02,590
little bit the hardware compatibility or

01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,200
the hardware acceleration for patent

01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:10,090
there are you see Java is faster than

01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:12,160
piden Google is doing artwork to Oxford

01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:17,710
JavaScript and so on and are there any

01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:19,630
thoughts about helping letting the

01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:23,920
hardware help patent or letting I didn't

01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:25,630
help harder yes absolutely there are

01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:28,360
actually a number of different there are

01:12:25,630 --> 01:12:33,040
three different projects that I'm aware

01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:34,690
of one is one is looking toward

01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,460
register-based a register-based

01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:39,610
implementation of Python that's still

01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:42,640
compatible with with with the basic

01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:44,920
Python another is pi pi which has a jit

01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:47,739
and the third it that I find very

01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:50,650
exciting it and then if you looked at or

01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:54,930
play with numba at all and if you heard

01:12:50,650 --> 01:12:57,670
of numba it numba is an optimizing

01:12:54,930 --> 01:13:00,370
compiler mostly it's mostly for

01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:03,190
vectorizing and math related stuff but

01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:06,190
it will get you actually just as fast as

01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:10,780
Fortran or see just by adding an auto

01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:13,480
jit and auto jit decorator over your

01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:15,430
your function so take a look at that so

01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:20,020
there are active research projects in

01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:24,489
terms of doing that what I bought it hi

01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:28,180
hi yes did I not mention pi PI then

01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:30,400
smart kelly also had a comment just a

01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:34,810
little comment about this python 3 stuff

01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:38,890
and solaris and 26 and so maybe you can

01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:42,180
adapt your software to fully exploit

01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:44,860
what 26 offers and drop 2.5

01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:49,830
compatibility and then you have already

01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:52,530
gone quite away towards 0 point 3.3

01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:56,080
because there's quite some compatibility

01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:58,930
but you need to drop 2.5 because there

01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:02,620
is some stuff you can do in a similar

01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:03,730
way in Python 3 but if you support 26 at

01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:06,430
least and 33

01:14:03,730 --> 01:14:09,760
at least quite a lot of stuff gets

01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:12,130
rather easy and they're all quite some

01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:15,390
stuff on the internet and blog posts

01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:20,140
about this stuff so just look it up and

01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:23,500
look up six and look look at what six

01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:30,460
offers for 25 and maybe not do that but

01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:32,980
rolla drop 25 I also had a couple

01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:35,560
comments first of all there's some doubt

01:14:32,980 --> 01:14:37,360
I think there may have been a violation

01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:40,239
of the code of conduct to because

01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,950
somebody spoke curse words like you know

01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:44,739
the three better word is an H in the

01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:50,440
middle I don't think that sell out we

01:14:44,739 --> 01:14:55,380
keep keep it clean so okay now no on a

01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:58,030
more serious point my core answer to why

01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:01,090
it wasn't wrong it was absolutely

01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:03,700
indispensable and Python would be dying

01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:06,820
by now if we hadn't done it to introduce

01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:10,090
an incompatibility comes back to the

01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:12,250
little point man made and I will vastly

01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:15,400
elaborate this afternoon about good

01:15:12,250 --> 01:15:18,280
enough is good enough a core reason good

01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:22,270
enough is good enough is that you do get

01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:24,400
to fix your mistakes if you recognize

01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:27,250
you made a mistake the first time and

01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:30,010
it's considered an error to ever fix

01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:33,910
that mistake then good enough is not

01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:36,520
good enough anymore you need to design

01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:38,980
for 50 years before releasing anything

01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,750
otherwise you hear criticism for

01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:44,410
introducing backwards incompatibilities

01:15:40,750 --> 01:15:50,460
when you fix your mistakes I want to

01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:55,270
make it very clear going for single byte

01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:58,720
character strings as the default was not

01:15:55,270 --> 01:16:02,230
a debatable design decision in

01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:04,810
retrospect inside being 2020 it was a

01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:07,840
bad mistake at the roughly the same time

01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:11,200
Java was doing the right design decision

01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:14,530
of having string be unicode that's what

01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:16,930
text is about because english-speaking

01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:17,600
countries are not the only ones in the

01:16:16,930 --> 01:16:20,330
universe

01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:25,400
I think anyone here from a non-english

01:16:20,330 --> 01:16:35,090
speaking country you're American you

01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:36,860
should radio and fixing that error could

01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:40,010
not be done in a backwards compatible

01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:43,100
way full stop that's everything else you

01:16:40,010 --> 01:16:47,120
can debate but not they nature the fact

01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:52,730
that text should be universal and that

01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:55,550
requires Unicode unrelated note to the

01:16:52,730 --> 01:17:02,960
english-speaking countries who is a here

01:16:55,550 --> 01:17:06,850
and is not from Europe few people all

01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:06,850
right still can be called your Python

01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:23,770
any more questions not even upstairs all

01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:23,770
right we have we have 10 minutes lose

01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:39,910
we just actually it's not really a

01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:42,790
question but could you please submit

01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:45,430
your lightning talks to some lightning

01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:47,950
talk registering boards which I also

01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:52,510
asked the organizers to put out at the

01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:53,770
registration desk all right let's make

01:17:52,510 --> 01:17:57,730
sure you do lightning talks it's one of

01:17:53,770 --> 01:18:01,650
the most fun things so which case thank

01:17:57,730 --> 01:18:01,650
you all enjoy your Python

01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,340
