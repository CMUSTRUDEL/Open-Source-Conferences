ok

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:53,570
telecom engine hi one another person

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:57,660
without representation of Patrick buter

00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:59,579
each layer of success about introducing

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,850
pythoness a mind language in a company

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:11,729
or in on you st so let's shut up our

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:14,640
cell phones and enjoy thank you everyone

00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,050
it's very cool that I'm here I was

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,970
surprised how many people are interested

00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:19,800
in this subject because it's more of a

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:22,680
business subject then a technical

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,430
subject let us have a quick look at our

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,170
agenda so first of all I will explain

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,000
you why I think that I should give this

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,550
talk so what is my motivation why I

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,140
think this is interesting and very

00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,899
quickly I promise you this is not a

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,860
commercial thing one slide about our

00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:42,390
computer that you know who we are and

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,009
then the motivation and the question why

00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,460
do we need a new programming language

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:51,810
inside our company then why should this

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:53,820
language be pipe then how did we

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,640
implement piping at sources what did you

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,009
do to ensure that Titan becomes one of

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,040
our main or a core language we use to

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,200
develop of course this this introduction

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,540
had some problems so i will shortly list

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,340
you the pitfalls maybe it is interesting

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:11,160
for you if you have a sip similar bro

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,720
check and then i think also very

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,730
interesting hyphen in the business

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,519
because i think we all know the

00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,610
technical advantages of titan and it is

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:21,690
a bit different when you try to sell it

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,880
there are some hurdles you need to

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,040
overcome some things some prejudices and

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,360
some things you have to know or maybe we

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,790
found out and i think it's interesting

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,299
for other people and last but not least

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,610
was it worth doing this step since i'm

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:39,020
standing near yes it was worth

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:41,850
but still why your boss is worse yet so

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,650
out of interest and how many of you here

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:45,600
in this room are involved in any kind of

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,000
management decision can be for a small

00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,220
company or inside a bigger company just

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,870
to see so I thought oh yeah so I hope

00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:58,220
it's interesting for you and of course

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,250
what your SS available so the motivation

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,020
what you see here is a very famous and

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,360
slide wedding favors triangle you see it

00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:09,120
in every management book and it is this

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,640
famous triangle quality cost and time

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,800
and you cannot mad easily may be played

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,540
all of them in the same time so usually

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,810
if you don't pay and you have no time

00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:21,630
you quality will be low okay very well

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:24,209
very famous ring and looks trivial but

00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,250
is true and this is the main challenge

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:30,750
for all IT projects in a commercial

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:34,560
environment yeah because your customer

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,850
usually comes to you when he has no time

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,440
left because he spent a lot of time

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,090
thinking that you should do something

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,580
and then he wants to have it in no time

00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,709
in the best quality at the lowest

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,500
possible costs because interestingly

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,989
enough from my experience when you sell

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,000
software project it is not like selling

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:55,769
a car if someone wants to buy a car

00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,930
exactly nobody goes to the next hyundai

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,590
branch you will not get the same quality

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:03,630
as going to the BMW branch with software

00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,110
people are expected to get the quality

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,150
that they are used to from google or

00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,780
whoever big company but they don't want

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,090
to pay that's the always too challenging

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,519
it's really like this so the challenge

00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:21,000
becomes even more complicated manual as

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,960
many projects so what you need to

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,600
successfully breed successfully die the

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,900
company Google time company like

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,190
substance will make software you need

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:35,160
according to my experience we need a

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,470
right process for your project the

00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,310
process should be a little bit flexible

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,080
but it should still give some guidelines

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,180
it should not be home the preset scrum

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,220
just because crime is very fancy

00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,800
hood certainly also not time to present

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,680
the world for just something which gives

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,630
you a guideline then you need the right

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,220
mix of projects and customers that's

00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,100
something which is very very important

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,070
because if you have ten customers all of

00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,620
them technically complex and business

00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,180
critical you will have a problem because

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,840
your company will be under the constant

00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,870
stress and your keep people they will

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,240
burn out very easy so the right mix of

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,669
projects and customer cessary a good

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,849
task and important tasks then you need

00:05:17,669 --> 00:05:23,430
the right team the right team for the

00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:26,820
classical there's no point in having an

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,500
a team consisting of ten of the best

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,930
pipes and developers available in the

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,090
world because they each of them is a

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,280
very experienced person each person will

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:37,590
have a relative a clear vision of how to

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,130
do things so you always need to mix the

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,810
writing some senior people some medium

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,750
level normal people and some junior

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:48,780
people and then you need to write

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:53,250
technology last but not least and maybe

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:54,750
it's pipe not always i will comment last

00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:59,430
one of these very important you also

00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:01,169
need luck it's true it's true and i find

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,210
it very interesting because you look at

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:06,539
all those success stories you see how do

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,000
we prove grow and how facebook became

00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:10,320
big handled and so on but everybody

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,330
forgets that at a certain time they

00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,400
respect for example there were other

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,680
other platforms compacting and these

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:27,139
people making those platforms they were

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:27,139
not stupid how to run

00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:39,819
so that was bad luck and I did not

00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:45,489
plant it okay and you still hear me back

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:47,139
there okay so you need luck well of

00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,789
course I cannot tell you how to enforce

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,629
lock there are many techniques to do

00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:55,569
that but maybe it's not in in the scope

00:06:52,629 --> 00:06:57,759
of this so i can tell you from our

00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,889
experience at success about the process

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,529
the people and the technology and for

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,110
today i will feed i will focus on one

00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:08,589
point how mainly how to how we

00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:10,269
implemented piping at success that's

00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:11,709
what what you will hear and i believe

00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:13,360
that this is interesting for other

00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:15,549
people as well because it gives you some

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,159
you hear from someone else who did it

00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:23,169
maybe you can take something home to to

00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:24,549
use so very quickly as i said success we

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,409
are making individual software

00:07:24,549 --> 00:07:29,199
development and consulting in this area

00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:31,689
we are about 60 people we are a little

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,249
bit special we are our head porter is

00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:36,249
near boutique or near zurich but we have

00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:40,360
teams in Minsk Belarus in Saigon ho chi

00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:43,709
minh city vietnam so we have of course

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,509
like any a very company some kind of a

00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:48,129
television and we say our vision is the

00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,369
trust that's really important we try to

00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:52,629
make the things our customer want and we

00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:55,569
believe that we should have a certain

00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:56,889
competence when doing that and by the

00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,449
way that that that doesn't mean always

00:07:56,889 --> 00:08:00,669
using the bleeding the last

00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:03,489
bleeding-edge technology it means

00:08:00,669 --> 00:08:05,409
knowing the right tool for the task and

00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:07,839
we are sustainable that's very important

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:11,769
we are self financed and we believe in

00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:14,049
this because self-financed if you leave

00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:18,099
yourself financed you are able to

00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:22,299
weather storms ok that's all about my

00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:24,009
company so we come to the question which

00:08:22,299 --> 00:08:27,459
lies at the core of this presentation

00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:29,949
and and the question is ok why did we

00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:33,159
need a new programming language in order

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:34,779
to explain this i need to maybe reach

00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,709
out a little bit into the area of sales

00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:41,169
so like all small companies bigger

00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:43,400
companies have it as well but small

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,460
companies have it a lot you

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:47,900
to have a so-called sales funnel so

00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:51,020
basically you need to have a very broad

00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,330
intake and then at the end something

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:55,240
should come out here so as an individual

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,980
software development company the broad

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,360
intake means that you just go on to the

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,660
market and you tell the people that you

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,420
can do everything they want SI p no

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,100
problem we are the ASAP experts they

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,230
want JavaScript yes we invent the

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,320
JavaScript basically and all those

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,880
things so that that's the debt that's

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,430
the problem you so as a sales guy you

00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:20,390
will do that as the technical guy of

00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:23,390
course this is a horror because a lot of

00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,280
the project will be new for you in a lot

00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:27,860
of project you will have technical risks

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,370
which you don't have if you already have

00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:33,380
experience in your area ok so we grew

00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:36,470
with this model it's a normal model

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:40,580
eight standard and by end around 10,000

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,340
to 2010-2011 we really had a problem and

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:45,230
I had to had several discussions with my

00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,540
business partner me being the technician

00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:50,660
he is being the sales guy because we had

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:53,540
project in Delhi with Java C C++ C sharp

00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,580
PHP and of course javascript and HTML

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,440
also I didn't mention you there is one

00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,580
where was one passion project which was

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,320
developed maintained by myself and so we

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,670
had this problem for example in the

00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,640
Titan area there was the prom that there

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,860
was no backup for me also it was wetter

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,740
derivative pricing engine so it's not an

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,780
easy business so you need to do Stein

00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:17,110
someone who understands it so we had

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,000
this problem that we were very broad

00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:22,190
then we decided that the mobile world is

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,430
important so we started to make iOS

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,860
projects and also Android project the

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,680
project's varied in size from several

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,830
men there is really very small mobile

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,810
projects two very big main year's

00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,060
project one of the projects for example

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:40,580
is running since 2005 with the team of

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:45,470
six developers constantly working on it

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:47,690
making it bigger so at that time it got

00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:49,460
really uncomfortably hot especially for

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,310
me because and also for my colleagues

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:54,440
who are senior developers because a lot

00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:56,960
of things at the end landed on our desks

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,500
we had to resolve them quickly so really

00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,750
there

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,190
it was a time when some of our senior

00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:04,010
developed he was programming on the same

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,740
time in Java Intel feel maybe also had

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,980
some support case in C so we had a

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:13,220
problem so we decided we need to reduce

00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,480
our portfolio of technologies but still

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,030
we need to have a relatively broad

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,160
funnel still offer people from the

00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,780
windows area from Linux for macintosh

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,810
and work from from the banks where they

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:27,860
have big centralized systems basically

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:30,020
our services that was the motivation so

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,030
also from a front from the economic

00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,860
point of view there was I asp net so

00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,170
basically wet the web stack of Microsoft

00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,210
and PHP they were freaks because there

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,360
we already still have and we had at that

00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:43,100
time big customers paying on the monthly

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,750
bus is a lot of money so we could not

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,110
just kick out those technologies so

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,870
those two technologies were freaks and

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,970
then what's the question how what

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,830
language can replace older in re

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,590
remaining languages of course it's not

00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:59,450
possible but we said we will not make

00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,580
any new project in the old in the other

00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:03,589
languages we will say we either offer

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:08,089
this technology this technology so asp

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:10,790
net PHP or the number three and then

00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:12,020
what what what language do you need you

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,400
need something which is platform

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:18,790
independent is clear you need a language

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:21,170
which is Mattoon and has a big community

00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:22,640
it's very important that the language is

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:24,350
mature because there are so many new

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,540
technologies on the market you never

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:29,120
know what will stay more than one or two

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:32,030
years so you need something which has

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,910
proven it's very let's say its value and

00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,560
you need a big community of course to

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:38,650
get support and also to find the

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,180
developers who are interested in either

00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:44,960
carrying on the work in this community

00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:47,690
or starting to learn it end last but not

00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,490
least the learning curve because

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,339
remember we are a small company cannot

00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:58,670
invest one or two years train a team

00:12:52,339 --> 00:13:00,260
without getting money for it so then it

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,870
was the big question of course to

00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:06,490
tonight as i say 1997 learning curve

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,240
maybe not but platforming dependency

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,750
instability and tony would have been

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,140
maybe chava but today it's pipe

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:15,850
in my opinion also I had experience in

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,740
PI from us also Alice but it's also not

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:19,630
let's say it's very important so I knew

00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:22,630
that you can learn Python quickly I

00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,820
learnt in 2008 relatively quickly and

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,520
already in 2009 i went to odo payton and

00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,970
talked about my project in birmingham so

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:35,050
i said we need pipe my business partner

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,730
at leat so we said okay piping reason is

00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:39,460
clear it is really simple you all know

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:42,280
that it is versatile its platform

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:44,920
agnostic you can use it for the full web

00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,500
applications as a programming language

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,270
on your server you can use it to

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,800
generate JavaScript if you like and you

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,470
can use it on also on client server

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,870
applications on the client and last but

00:13:53,470 --> 00:14:00,040
not least we like the philosophy behind

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:04,300
pipe we believe in this way so we said

00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:06,220
okay we are going to take Python and we

00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,350
are making pipes and Alfred programming

00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:13,660
language our main programming language

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:15,490
actually which leads to the question

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,800
okay how do we do it it was very nice

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:20,050
usually take our decisions on the Friday

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:26,080
just before the weekend then the

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:28,450
decision is very quickly taking its true

00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,940
it has all the reasons but is too so

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,410
usually we take a day off on Friday we

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:35,050
go somewhere nice and we have lunch

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,940
together and we discussed let's say good

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,950
strategy of the company so we took this

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,830
decision visit okay pipe now it was my

00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:43,390
task to find out how to do it and

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:46,660
especially how do you cope with the

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,130
risks yeah because yeah we decided I

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,260
knew the language my business part is

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:52,120
coming really he used to be a developer

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,370
in the 80s and he used to code in visual

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,210
basic so he for him pikemen was just a

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:02,440
language and now he's selling things so

00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:06,280
how to mitigate those risks and the

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:09,400
basic the parties of our decision was

00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:11,350
the following four principles and you

00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,210
also find them in management books and

00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,490
this is just the things which we found

00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:17,500
out during our work if you take some

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,560
decision in general you should take it

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,940
quickly and also implemented quickly

00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,760
basically interesting enough often you

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:28,420
don't get more by pondering about

00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:31,180
sure know a lot yeah then also very

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,090
important people learn only with real

00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:37,180
challenges I hear I wrote better but now

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:39,640
I tell you it's only normal people learn

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:41,920
only with real challenges then we are

00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,960
important you should always avoid it as

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,680
a small company as an entrepreneur to

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,710
make research research is not innovation

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,500
yeah innovation is put something new at

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,330
that's my definition is some innovation

00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,490
is doing something new in your company

00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,580
may be providing a new product to the

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,980
market but it's not research so the idea

00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,290
was not to make a scientific comparison

00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,760
between I don't know python c sharp and

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,460
java and then find out what is better

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:13,690
and so it was really the idea introduced

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,610
puffin in this company and number three

00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:17,860
and four are very well connected you

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:20,530
cannot afford as a small company to

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,230
spend a lot of money in finding out what

00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:27,100
would be the right way you should have

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:28,660
your activities financed somehow as I

00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,310
said we are self financed we have no

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:32,440
money from the bank that means

00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:38,980
everything we spend this from our budget

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:40,990
so it's very simple we just said ok the

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:46,860
next project which is suitable we take

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:46,860
and we use it we may we do it with pipe

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,820
you need to hit your bed still you

00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,500
cannot just take any project so we said

00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,230
okay first of all it should not be

00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,820
critical quickly getting the critical de

00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,770
means that the science is very big or

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,810
the customer is critical for us that we

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:05,410
should not lose it the customer if the

00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,630
project does not go well ok so do not

00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,459
take a critical project the sec this is

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:11,949
clear the second point is inviting less

00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:15,550
clear the project should not be too

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:18,370
small because what people don't know

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:21,400
often is that small projects are for

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:23,380
some reasons often more risky usually

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,690
because you have less time to find out

00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,070
what you're actually doing already if

00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,140
you only have three weeks you should

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,180
really make every step correct if you

00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,610
have one man here you can take your time

00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,090
set up things properly study the

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,880
business logic and Sonia so you need a

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,980
project which should not be

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,570
too small I said at least one mainly the

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,340
reason was simply we wanted to make it

00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:48,590
with three or four developers in three

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:50,630
to four months ok so what but still the

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,660
project should not contain any

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:55,460
complicated technical challenges so for

00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,710
example the thing I mentioned with what

00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,930
we tried it the weather derivative prize

00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,940
engine I did not do it this alone I had

00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:04,400
a very experienced hyphen developer

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,720
former mathematician who made the big

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,820
business logic at the beginning and

00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,220
helped me a lot so there were technical

00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,960
risks and I could just let's say sit

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,430
beside him while he was driving the

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,860
project and I could learn the language

00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:17,510
if you do this alone it would be a

00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,920
problem because you would have technical

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:23,750
challenges in a language you don't know

00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,340
also what people often confuse you

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,620
should also not have a complicated

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,050
business logic because the business

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:32,150
logic sometimes can be transferred

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,160
transformed into a very simple technical

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:37,190
solution but you need to understand it

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,470
first so also don't take a complicated

00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:42,050
business logic and last but not least

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,090
don't do it as we say in German on the

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,430
open heart don't choose a risky domain

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:48,590
if you are working in hospitals and you

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,390
provide vital systems for the patients

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,280
maybe it's not a good idea although

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,630
people do it to use a new technology for

00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,810
it just because it's interesting and

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:01,790
this is a real case I saw it once in a

00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:05,090
project ok and then you should use easy

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:08,930
tools with a with a with a with a let's

00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:12,320
say a good learning curve so in our

00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:14,270
example it was web 2 pi a web framework

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,720
racing on pipe which I personally like a

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,360
lot ok and then last but not least you

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,040
should not give this task to your most

00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,840
senior developed but just because it's

00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,960
the most senior developer you should

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,170
take a specific team with people who are

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,580
interested to learn something new I

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,140
don't know from marketing theory there

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,050
is this idea that there are people who

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:38,180
resist to change people who are normal

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,980
like yeah maybe nice maybe not and

00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:42,020
people who are the first movers they

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,060
like it so if there's a new iphone they

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,030
will run to the shop and buy it yet so

00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,560
you should have in your team people from

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:52,080
the second and the third category

00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,570
not everybody should be a first first

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,360
mover because they will throw overboard

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,670
everything take no consideration of the

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,080
risks you should have some first mover

00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,850
and you should have someone with a

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:05,790
little bit more critical but still open

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:09,090
you should not take someone who is

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:11,640
against the project because it sounds

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,200
simple but it's maybe not so simple to

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,490
implement maybe it's an important person

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,380
in your team but you should explain this

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,290
person that at the end is the only thing

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,170
the person will do it she will or he

00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:24,750
will prove that it's not possible to use

00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:28,530
this language yeah so you should take a

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:30,780
positive mind T and last but not least

00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:32,460
this also turned out to be important you

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,740
should still give the project manager a

00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,240
goal and the goal in my Inn in our

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,250
opinion we always said we want to have a

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,200
project with profit because we are doing

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,030
a business and if you want to have a new

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,070
language and if passion is as good as I

00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,830
claim this then it should be possible

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,780
also with a new project given a fair

00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:52,620
customer and so on that you can earn

00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:55,410
money with it it also ensures that the

00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,510
people are doing the right things but

00:20:55,410 --> 00:21:05,070
that's how we did it and it worked that

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:06,990
way of course we had some troubles so in

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,860
my opinion was surprisingly smooth how

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,600
it work it it worked but some problem we

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,920
had and one of the most important

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,720
problem is when you move from one

00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,270
programming language to the other it's

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:22,770
also very simple but important to

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:27,260
remember for example typhoon is not java

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:29,520
oh yeah it's it yeah but the point is

00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,220
the spice which maybe even especially

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,990
knocked out and but the point is people

00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,400
start using patent and of course they

00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,290
use the right syntax otherwise it would

00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:40,650
not run but they program in a way like

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,690
like they are used from Java so they may

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:44,730
be I call it they blow up the feelings a

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,320
little bit it's a bit too wikia and they

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,580
don't have but it's important cha ways

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,520
like this but there are also the tools

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,850
for java so in pipe you don't have them

00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,980
so you use you have to ensure that they

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,230
really have the time to learn how you do

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:02,010
things that ironic way so you should

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,299
take care to make code review now in a

00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:04,860
university and why

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,899
ending a big company environment

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,759
especially in the scientific plea or

00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:12,929
technically oriented big companies code

00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:17,009
review is totally normal I believe but

00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:19,019
in a small company not only now company

00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:21,269
in general in smaller companies code

00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:23,220
review is often at a thing you don't do

00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:24,869
because you have no time for it you take

00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,090
the customer does not pay for it so you

00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:28,529
just write the software it's running

00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:30,749
maybe you have a unit test and then you

00:22:28,529 --> 00:22:32,369
deploy and it's fine if you're doing

00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:35,639
something you please make the code

00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:37,259
review because you will be hot there

00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:39,989
will be big problems otherwise for sure

00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:43,200
so take the time to have a look at the

00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:44,970
code also don't do it like I did because

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,059
I looked at the code after two and a

00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:49,950
half months it was ready I had no time

00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:52,169
simply I knew it was stupid but I did

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,450
and I can really tell you it is to prick

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:57,749
don't do it look at the code after the

00:22:54,450 --> 00:23:00,299
first print maybe two weeks maybe even

00:22:57,749 --> 00:23:02,070
after after the first first week it's

00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:05,100
your decision don't look at it too late

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:10,230
because three people can write a lot of

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,669
lines of code in two months we were bad

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:13,679
way I'm very lucky because the guy who

00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,869
let's say committed the biggest crimes

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,730
he is a very actually quite experienced

00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:19,649
developer and very well very committed

00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:23,309
to company so he spent several weekends

00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:25,259
to to refactor his coat and he was in

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,909
the Hever sir Vietnamese guy so for him

00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:29,369
it was a question of Honor it was very

00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,989
good for us but you cannot know it

00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:32,789
through yeah they have a they have

00:23:30,989 --> 00:23:33,989
really that the mindset in Vietnam in my

00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:36,389
opinion very good they really want to

00:23:33,989 --> 00:23:38,159
make quality so for him it was

00:23:36,389 --> 00:23:42,799
embarrassing so he corrected it but you

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:46,259
cannot rely on that so look at it early

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,820
then allow the people to refactor that's

00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:49,259
why make the project big enough that

00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,119
they can refactor because they will

00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:52,710
learn during during their work and

00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,149
Damian know after one month they will

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,279
know that what they did on the first day

00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:58,889
was not good so allow them to refactor

00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,960
give them the time in the planning also

00:23:58,889 --> 00:24:04,470
explain it to your customer that's very

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,179
important maybe that's also something

00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,730
maybe you should tell your customer if

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:10,889
you use a new tool I mean this is a

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,029
business decision but maybe it's good if

00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:14,039
you have a good relationship with your

00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:15,600
customer and you make him a good price

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,470
maybe he is willing to take this

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,590
adventure

00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:21,840
and force the refactoring is the next

00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,669
thing sometimes and they think it's

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,370
perfect or they don't want to spend the

00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:30,299
time do not only allow it ask them to

00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:32,100
revoke you and also very important and

00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:35,490
not so easy for me personally you have

00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,309
to be patient it comes also with the

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,539
point 7 you should not interfere

00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,130
especially you have experiencing pain

00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,020
and you love it and you know how to do

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,030
it and then you give it just to give a

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,429
task to someone else and this guy this

00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:49,020
person he or she doesn't matter will

00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:51,600
have no experience in Python and we'll

00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:53,909
do it differently now you can take the

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,409
code and correct it everything and then

00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:57,000
you can say this is how you do how we do

00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:00,150
it and the next time you will do the

00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,340
same and the end again the same so be

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:04,740
patient do not interfere let them do

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:08,340
their work that's a general advice but

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:11,010
it's especially here very important in

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,799
the middle of your project one of your

00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,960
developers will tell you look I need

00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:18,720
five days with piping for this because

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,059
it's very complex if I use JavaScript or

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:26,159
PHP whatever you use before it would

00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:29,100
take me one day or five hours and then

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,049
you say no simply because it's really

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,630
important that you be your strict don't

00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:35,490
you have a plan and you try to mitigate

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,650
your risks before so you can really be

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:39,600
strict I know we don't do it we use

00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,400
Titan and we learn how to do it in pipe

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,720
I'm sure the next time it will not in

00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:48,030
five days okay and last but not least

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:52,020
it's also connected with the point one

00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:54,929
pipe is very a child ensure that people

00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:57,450
are using this very simple the debug

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,820
cycle I'm it's always amazing for me

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:02,130
because you can basically take your

00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,080
software go to your route to your

00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,000
customer make if you are in that child

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,890
model make the Sprinter view and if you

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,039
see is a buck or if you want something

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,450
change you don't need recompile

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,440
everything and find all libraries you

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:17,700
can you can change practically in your

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,610
development environment and run again

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,289
and the customer will see the change so

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,370
explain the team that they should use

00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:27,809
those things it if it could engineer or

00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:29,910
not you can discuss because you will

00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:32,850
maybe not think a lot before do

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:35,670
it but for the customer it's very very

00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:37,410
nice he sees I wanted green and the guy

00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,080
was able to change to green in several

00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:43,250
minutes yeah so use this because this is

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,580
a real difference to other languages

00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:55,170
okay but that's the problems we had the

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:56,820
things i recommend you to do so when we

00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:01,260
come to the next point i want to touch

00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:03,900
down so how is how i saw that pipe is /

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,010
/ sister is powerfully seen in a

00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:10,500
business environment and again remember

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:14,790
the same stunnel as you see on the left

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:17,430
type a very many hot words technology

00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:19,020
center on and things coming to that

00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,480
funnel and at the end you get something

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:25,740
out and sometimes you are forced to do

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:29,220
the specific technology now the problem

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,750
is that charts changing from 10

00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,900
different programming languages or to

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:36,690
only free and one of them is pi and will

00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,820
not change this fact so if your customer

00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,370
has an essay p installation he wants to

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,780
have an essay p interface and you need

00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:45,750
to write it it doesn't matter in what

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:48,390
language and maybe he says all our

00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:50,700
interfaces to srp or written in java i

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,070
will develop with no java you will make

00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:54,570
this interface which other you should

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:57,450
not argue that it's just the fact and

00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,350
it's need so that's very important to

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:04,620
remember so the question is then how you

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:06,090
find out what factors exist that let's

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,370
say drive the decision for the

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:10,410
technology again you can find this in

00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:14,100
lot of books this is from the practical

00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,840
experience and there are two types of

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,390
decisions or let's say two types of

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,160
drivers behind such decisions one of the

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:21,960
things i call them the reasonable

00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,700
drivers whereas the other are the

00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,520
personal drivers maybe sometimes

00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,930
unreasonable the reasonable value of the

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,570
one of the most important is for sure

00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:32,880
surrounding systems so is the example we

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,520
have a child hims based message bus yes

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,149
you can connect with Java or Python or

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:41,989
any other language but the customer

00:28:39,149 --> 00:28:46,889
customer uses JMS mostly reduced Java so

00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:50,639
don't try to push pipe too much other

00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:54,960
thing is bossy systems for account the

00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:57,749
company has Orakpo so it's better also

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,059
for you to sell the project if you also

00:28:57,749 --> 00:29:02,789
suggest or act as a database of your

00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,649
choice for this project although you may

00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:07,499
think that it's too expensive and mysql

00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:09,359
is better and or what's better until it

00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:12,690
was bought by oracle and i will spa

00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:15,289
stress test analyst at spoken so yeah

00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,909
you know what I mean don't enforce this

00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,289
very important the pool guys at the IT

00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:20,899
department of bigger companies are

00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,759
usually provisioned only on one platform

00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:25,559
they know Microsoft and escrow server

00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,539
they know Oracle whatever they know

00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:30,869
those things they know IBM lotus domino

00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:32,879
and they want to use those tools so

00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:36,119
trying to help them by making the

00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:38,429
interface center and with this is also

00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:41,759
important sometimes there are contracts

00:29:38,429 --> 00:29:43,830
in place sometimes the company is part

00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,049
of a larger chain of a logistics chain

00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:48,779
for example and those contracts they

00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:52,739
enforce certain standards you should

00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:54,690
know them before you suggest I because

00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:57,089
all those things they result in the

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,789
point five hi investments to change the

00:29:57,089 --> 00:30:01,679
basis and this high investments maybe

00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:07,919
they will not get the project because

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:09,599
you make the wrong proposed then as a

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,109
set deep that the things before I

00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:15,089
considered reasonable and drivers took

00:30:13,109 --> 00:30:17,399
for technical decision there are also

00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:20,669
unreasonable maybe not must not be

00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:23,099
unreasonable they are more personal most

00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:24,960
important I don't know how many people

00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:28,859
have experience with the IT departments

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,149
of big companies you know how it is it

00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:33,029
takes very long and they are very

00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:36,119
reluctant to allocate route yes exactly

00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:36,370
you don't get any right but if you will

00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:38,730
see

00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:41,680
here you might have some power of this

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:45,010
yes I but i'm the CEO of a small company

00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:47,830
trying to sell something to a bigger so

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:51,220
so my let's say my standing there is

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:53,460
where Emma yeah so anyway the IT

00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,660
department of your customers usually

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,490
remember how they are i mean they are

00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,350
they will get the phone calls if

00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:02,350
something is not working people often

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,030
forget them so that's why they say okay

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:06,970
I know how this is working so why not

00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:09,640
use that so make the seeds of me and

00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:13,570
your friend it's very important don't

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,309
alienate him by I am let's say showing

00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,650
him that you think that he is lazy or

00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:20,590
they were making your friend it's very

00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:22,780
important then also management till

00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,420
you're saying a lot of things happen

00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:28,030
apparently I can only explain explain

00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,980
like this because someone on the Golf

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:32,110
Course hears from some colleague that

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,580
for example sharepoint is the solution

00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,130
for every management program they have

00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,809
and then they come to the to the IT

00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:41,590
department say we want to have

00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:43,720
sharepoint now or now it is more we need

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:46,179
an iPad all our processes must be

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,059
enabled on the iPad now in theory it's a

00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:50,320
good idea and but you should then use

00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,790
the opportunity and take the business

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,860
and others in what do you want to do

00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:57,970
find the business case for this idea

00:31:53,860 --> 00:32:01,030
base and then internal politics I saw

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:03,100
that a lot people tend to someone who

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,410
was very important and said that XY said

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:07,059
is the best architecture maybe this guy

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:09,640
left the company or he still somewhere

00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:13,230
else controlling his decision and and

00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:16,179
and this influences the outcome of

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:19,059
offers and so on so it can very much be

00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:21,280
that they make they ask you for a

00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:23,520
proposal then you should try to find out

00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:25,750
what exactly you should propose

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,860
otherwise you will for you you will just

00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:33,220
say no wrong technology and also last

00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:35,290
but not least religion we all know that

00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:37,510
time is the best possible programming

00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:40,929
language is we have it torrent it

00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:43,150
through please but there are two souls

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,970
who believe that C sharp is better

00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:48,310
whatever you and you will not you need

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,660
to find the way to convince and that for

00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,030
this project maybe pipe

00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:54,850
spider then C sharp or charm or whatever

00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:57,880
they have and you should not explain

00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:03,810
them y-pipe newspaper because they will

00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:06,280
explain your eyes in charlotte expect ok

00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:09,790
so now I told you why no one ever

00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:11,890
Williams patent and but there is of

00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:13,450
course the possibility that you need to

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,310
find some customers who are willing to

00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,560
listen to your proposal to what use a

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:22,750
chest so what do you tell the people

00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:23,710
that they will use later pipe and the

00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,660
first thing is clear platform

00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,030
independence that's a killer but it's

00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,730
not as not it's not a biggest killer for

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:33,130
me is really the development cycle and

00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:35,260
we as a software company with the team

00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:37,270
in in Belarusian in Vietnam we have a

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,640
problem with the speed because we need

00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:42,550
more management and be more more also

00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,710
control to ensure that I mean it's very

00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:47,320
hard for someone sitting on the desk

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,120
6,000 kilometres away from from its

00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,540
customer to find out what the customer

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,180
really wants so we have the problem that

00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,820
our development cycle is not as fast as

00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:00,940
it should be and I found out that my

00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,980
piping you can mitigate this now if you

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,720
have all your team on premise even at

00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,330
the customers in the customer's office

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,179
with this one that you can even get even

00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:12,370
faster so that really the main in my

00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:15,280
opinion the main argument to sell pipe

00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:17,169
is the depth the fast development cycle

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,570
and I mean the whole development cycle

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:22,330
including the maintenance and and also

00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:24,400
including the fact of quality you are

00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,650
making very fast very good software I

00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,800
think that's a nicely any drums

00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:31,720
everywhere poetry is also relatively

00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:34,780
important people ask because they read

00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,660
about Java and being bought by oracle my

00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:39,250
mysql being bought by oracle so it's

00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,890
completely open source there is no

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:44,040
company with a little more or less cool

00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:48,040
reputation controlling the direction

00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:51,190
yeah it is mature it is not a risk that

00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,169
some that tomorrow no one will stop no

00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:57,790
we will work with Peyton there's a big

00:34:53,169 --> 00:35:01,369
big community okay but still as I said

00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:03,890
before remember who is paying your

00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:05,450
the bill so do not force your joints of

00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,289
technology that's maybe there's a thing

00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:11,420
if you if you can suggest patent if not

00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:14,210
think about if you want to make your

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:17,210
throw not but do not force it you will

00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:20,240
not be happier to it in I say very

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:22,309
simply pure Microsoft environment where

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,470
everything is done around IAS and the

00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:26,720
squadron exchange and that be the

00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,999
customer has a lot of developers all

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,400
reading and experience with this

00:35:28,999 --> 00:35:33,230
technology maybe it's better if you if

00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,259
you have in your company that the

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:45,109
competences do c sharp unless you really

00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:48,650
ask for piping do not enforce it so when

00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:51,049
you suggest tighten the customers will

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:53,599
ask questions they will want to know

00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:56,119
things so what what we but i heard the

00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,220
most is for sure when the locking

00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:00,650
because really for the people in a

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,259
business they know about stop net and

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:04,609
1000 other child they know about don't

00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:06,589
let they know about java and everything

00:36:04,609 --> 00:36:09,950
else is for diminish it doesn't matter

00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:11,690
who what big companies using a pipe

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:14,359
norway whatever language for them

00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:16,999
charbon don't make that clear so you

00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:21,470
must take them the fear of being locked

00:36:16,999 --> 00:36:24,019
to your company the second point the

00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,759
field of open source because it's really

00:36:24,019 --> 00:36:27,230
true it's understandable as well from a

00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:29,239
business point of view you are standing

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:34,400
there really naked if you let open

00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:37,099
source project yeah a statutory so tell

00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,019
use components which are stable use

00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:41,150
components where you can guarantee that

00:36:39,019 --> 00:36:43,430
they live all info recep for a long time

00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:45,289
don't just take the next new open source

00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,849
project wait a little bit and take some

00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:49,849
take something which is has proven

00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:52,910
itself in the market and then as i said

00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:55,130
again help the c sub means they will not

00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,499
take the decision but they can break

00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,710
your project rollin to me or not they

00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:03,890
can break it help them and they they

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,420
will also influence the their managers

00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:07,460
because they manage the end also need

00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,470
some advice they will ask the technical

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:11,509
guys maybe the ones who later we'll run

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,590
the whole infrastructure so help them

00:37:11,509 --> 00:37:15,510
take them to feel

00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:16,980
and remember it's very hard now if you

00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,740
need to start I don't know programming

00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:21,480
in our tomorrow maybe to talk for it

00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,310
would be hard for you as well so there

00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,840
are people working several years with

00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:30,060
the same tools they happy they know it

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:32,190
so help them and then this is also from

00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,320
the book i think it's the first you

00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:35,550
learn about system architecture the

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,610
tetteh problems are usually not

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:41,040
technical so the technical decision you

00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,230
can explain the customer is less it's

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,990
important but it's more important to

00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:48,270
understand what technology issues you

00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,670
should use what for tech new children

00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:53,460
evening sorry it's more important to

00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:54,810
know what the but your problem is from

00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,840
the business point of view in dentate

00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:02,700
the decision about the technical wait

00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:09,960
okay good so we're already very close to

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:12,210
the end and yes it was virtually no it

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,030
was really good I can tell you that that

00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,800
the project was a web application with

00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:19,290
also with the mobile with an interface

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,170
in choice which will be used by mobile

00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:24,960
client and we could implement it very

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:28,440
fast it is an idea and a kind of a

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,870
special form of directory for where you

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:32,330
can find information about the

00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:35,070
communities in Switzerland about the

00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:36,630
municipalities and so on and it's not

00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:38,070
yet life but that has to do with the

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,780
business because the business partner

00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,610
now needs to find these investors I

00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,980
first wanted to have the application in

00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,260
place to find the people investing it so

00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,880
it's running we use web 2 pi for

00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,390
basically everything on the back end and

00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,940
we also wrote an iphone app and an

00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:59,040
android app for that different projects

00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:01,860
so after this and we really said okay

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,910
pythons really well worth the effort at

00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,970
the moment we have four different

00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:12,270
projects we pipe all of them involving a

00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:14,160
web 2 pi so our decision was now read

00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:16,140
the statute assist we took after this we

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,290
will make all individual web projects

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,060
with Python with basically web 2 pi if

00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:23,850
we can invent influence decision

00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,890
variable use this tool also for other

00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,220
things like desktop application I don't

00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:28,440
know

00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,869
things on the server side we will always

00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:36,480
suggest using pipe so I can say it was

00:39:33,869 --> 00:39:40,290
very very well and also very nice to see

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:57,869
that it works like this that concludes

00:39:40,290 --> 00:40:01,770
my speech during your presentation you

00:39:57,869 --> 00:40:04,380
said that you shouldn't start a project

00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:07,590
with patent it has complicated business

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:11,000
logic and don't see what business logic

00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:14,040
has to do with this kind of decision

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,540
it's a good point if you are on premise

00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:20,670
and from our experience I would

00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:22,380
structure of company having project

00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:24,090
management and maybe the lead developer

00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:27,080
in Switzerland and having a team in

00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:29,160
Belorussia and in Vietnam and

00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:32,700
understanding of the business logic gets

00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,890
even more crucial it me and it means you

00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,720
can lose a lot of time until people

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:40,230
understand really what your business is

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,820
from cultural differences and so so so

00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,420
we always look at the business logic

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:47,369
into the technical complexity yeah and

00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:52,560
we decide if it's complex so that's more

00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:54,990
specific to your business maybe yes

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,330
that's why it's in spatially important

00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:59,010
in our company I believe it's of general

00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:02,490
interest because really if the business

00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:04,349
object gets very complicated and then it

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:07,410
may be not good to also learn parallel

00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:08,760
and new technology so just to have only

00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:11,900
one problem which is the business logic

00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:17,280
but in our set up it gets ready

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:20,880
problematic I had a question of mobile

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,500
at some point sorry yeah yeah you had

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,849
you mentioned that you were doing mobile

00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,670
stuff are there at varying with the

00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:29,070
funnel and python is actually well

00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:30,690
suited for mobile though I heard about a

00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:33,480
couple of projects and I wants to ask if

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:35,730
you ever consider them especially

00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,460
Android because I don't know why iOS but

00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,080
there was a protocol pi site i think

00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,700
that would allow you to

00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,220
created inside android app only using

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,870
Python and kind of compiling it with PI

00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:48,400
sites you generate an Android that I

00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:52,000
don't know if that was ever something

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,920
you considered I look at it and only to

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,020
prove my business partner that you could

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,740
pipe new spice and everywhere but we

00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,750
never we never we never really made any

00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:03,310
project on the mobile with pipe okay

00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:05,020
it's a general problem with mobile

00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:06,190
projects that a lot of things and have

00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,170
to have to be done platform-specific

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:13,210
although there is phonegap and those

00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:16,630
things and also api change a lot IUP

00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:19,720
knives me thank you for talking have you

00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:24,310
ever tried the let's build a prototype

00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:27,850
in patent sales pitch to the C sharp and

00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:32,230
chava guys we just two just two just a

00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:36,070
prototype and if we prove it works we

00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:38,110
can do implement it in the real language

00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,570
no to be honest no it's a very good idea

00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:42,340
because together with this week one of

00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:44,350
the biggest telecom companies we have

00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,840
something similar regarding prototypes

00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,640
in place but only for mobile from things

00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,780
just make up front so it would be very

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,630
good idea it never came to get you great

00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:58,540
oak just a question about the financial

00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:02,290
effect of choosing Python do you

00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:03,730
consider you will earn more money or do

00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:09,190
you think you will be cheaper for your

00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:11,230
customers in the end if you if you look

00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,480
at the project so those are the first

00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:16,600
project you do book can you already have

00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,730
a trend saying that basically you're

00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:22,330
you're getting faster with pythons and

00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:25,300
another languages so it will be less in

00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:27,040
general days so you're gonna get either

00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,690
more money or be cheaper for your

00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,100
customers do you already have this kind

00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:36,310
of affection in your company I maybe you

00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:39,840
can guess it's coming I don't know I can

00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:42,619
guess quite well because we measure our

00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:46,039
costs on it on a daily parties and month

00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:48,890
we basically closed out our financial

00:43:46,039 --> 00:43:50,749
books our lectures so we know we try to

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:53,299
know from every project that if we

00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:55,700
actually exactly what it costs us and

00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:58,460
also including the main name when I can

00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,109
tell you is that that at the beginning

00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:01,789
of course was not fast but now it's

00:44:00,109 --> 00:44:03,440
getting faster I'm involved in a

00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:06,019
relatively big project with a medical

00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,660
company and they're the pipe part is

00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:10,670
Python biggest part from outside there's

00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,559
also a child part and the guys using

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:14,749
pipes not extremely faster and this is

00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,019
all so amazing and financially very good

00:44:14,749 --> 00:44:20,589
for us and so I can say yes but the most

00:44:18,019 --> 00:44:23,509
the most important point for me is

00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:25,519
maintenance gets less of a problem we

00:44:23,509 --> 00:44:28,730
have less technical problems interesting

00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:32,650
enough of the class yeah exactly why

00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:36,170
would say yes it makes sense financially

00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:37,730
but maybe what just one finger it also

00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:39,019
had to do with the decision could maybe

00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,789
it could have been a programming

00:44:39,019 --> 00:44:43,039
language it was just a decision to have

00:44:40,789 --> 00:44:47,210
only three the programming languages and

00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:48,619
not ten which increases your experience

00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,150
in all three of them and then you have

00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,950
less problems and then you think it must

00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:56,539
be paid but that's a part of the

00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:58,910
decision so thanks for the great talk

00:44:56,539 --> 00:45:01,519
and you were briefly mentioned that you

00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:04,210
work with bangs and I'm in the financial

00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:04,210
business too and

00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:18,480
professional support I know that's like

00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:42,839
lots of Python consulting going around

00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:45,599
they really like going to know it's very

00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:53,339
hard it is it's really very hot i can

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:58,200
tell you okay talking it's very hard to

00:45:53,339 --> 00:46:01,200
argue against that and so it's very hard

00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,000
to argue against that the problem so i

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,130
can tell you in the financial aid our

00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,480
customers are usually using Charles we

00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,910
have as I said we have this weather

00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,769
derivatives pricing engine that's quite

00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,690
a big customer quite an interesting

00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:16,109
business tax abatements life I just

00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:18,859
start up so they decide and for the

00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:21,869
bank's I could not give you the advice

00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:23,670
all speaking I think you just mainly

00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:26,549
need to mention to them that several

00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:30,240
really really critical and box in Java

00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:32,880
were not fixed our months yeah and so

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,950
that the argument of being here let's

00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,319
say project by some big Wagner is not

00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:41,849
really true because it's not clear what

00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:44,009
the target of these wineries I cannot

00:46:41,849 --> 00:46:48,960
give you the Pacific all right I would

00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:51,950
like to know another question the micro

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,950
so now seems walking

00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:57,979
first of all just a comment a gentleman

00:46:55,939 --> 00:47:00,079
hero that this is really good article

00:46:57,979 --> 00:47:02,029
that addresses that question about by

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,759
Clay Shirky i believe and it's called a

00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:10,999
love internet style basically talks

00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:14,089
about how open source is is actually

00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:17,479
lasts longer than a lot of the when

00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:19,249
people ask for no authoritative source

00:47:17,479 --> 00:47:21,289
that they can get support from it's

00:47:19,249 --> 00:47:24,349
really good status could love internet

00:47:21,289 --> 00:47:26,389
stuff you google it can find it my

00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:29,149
question thanks for a great talk my

00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:33,109
question is have you ever said no to

00:47:29,149 --> 00:47:35,359
clients and because of you you

00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:37,249
recommended using platinum or a better

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:39,919
way of doing things and and they said no

00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:41,479
and I mean do you do you accept all the

00:47:39,919 --> 00:47:44,209
clients you guys get or the guys say no

00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:46,549
a lot it paints on the side for your in

00:47:44,209 --> 00:47:48,229
I mean basically at the beginning you

00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:49,489
may never ever rejected any clients and

00:47:48,229 --> 00:47:52,819
we learned that this is not very wise

00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:55,789
but you do it because you need the money

00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:58,609
and now we are a little bit bigger and

00:47:55,789 --> 00:48:00,709
yes we decline sometimes quite because

00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:03,380
mostly not because they take the wrong

00:48:00,709 --> 00:48:05,599
decision in technology but because that

00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:08,269
we see that it's impossible to make the

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:10,009
project successful and let's say the

00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:14,569
technology decision is that just one is

00:48:10,009 --> 00:48:16,609
hard okay yeah so yeah we decline client

00:48:14,569 --> 00:48:19,699
because we think they are not let's say

00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:22,249
able to make the project I even heard

00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:24,229
that big consulting companies assess

00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:26,199
that customers before they really make

00:48:24,229 --> 00:48:29,659
an offer to them to find out if they are

00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:32,919
if it's a let's say how to say a dead

00:48:29,659 --> 00:48:32,919
walk to make the project

00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:45,090
so was Python 3 are part of your

00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:49,310
decision and what are the risks that you

00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:49,310
saw this pine tree for your business

00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:57,510
okay better yeah sorry ok I have to be

00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,910
open and honest here at the moment we

00:48:57,510 --> 00:49:03,180
use PI through seven and simply because

00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:05,250
web 2 pi is still on version 2 and the

00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:08,280
previous project I made are also still

00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:11,160
on pie for two so I know that we should

00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:15,240
look at pi 3 in the future but I cannot

00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:20,640
tell you anything about it so you also

00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:24,060
outsource to Vietnam did you go there to

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:26,820
also teach them python and how did you

00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:29,160
develop them and yes we outsource to

00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:31,940
Vietnam the company's belongs to us so

00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:34,950
it's a dot let's say a branch of us and

00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:37,710
we as I said we teach them by the

00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:40,830
project and by code review so they get

00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:45,119
the task they do it with you to review

00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:47,820
it review the code and give advice we

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:51,240
don't believe in in let's say education

00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:53,100
days without a practical purpose so you

00:49:51,240 --> 00:50:03,570
should have a project and then you find

00:49:53,100 --> 00:50:06,030
out how you do it hello I'm trying again

00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:08,369
okay so thank you much for your talk i'm

00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:10,650
i'm working in the quad company which is

00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:15,420
using python and i just wanted to add

00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:19,980
that really the speed and quality of the

00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:22,230
prod you generate inside because we are

00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,570
providing services for our own company

00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:27,960
and we do it in python and even the

00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:29,850
java.net oracle guys informatica guys

00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,950
all the guys are saying wow you can do

00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:33,359
it so fast so it's aligned with with

00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:35,280
your experience it's really nice and

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:36,990
really happy because python is getting

00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:42,020
to the corporate environment and this is

00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:42,020
really cool thank you

00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:53,210
I didn't say the last time too great

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,730
talk thank you and just a testimony we

00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:58,610
I've been working at a small start-up

00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:03,140
for like nine months now and at first we

00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:05,360
are to the three developers and the two

00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,850
other developers are PHP guys and at

00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:11,180
first when I try to say hey Python could

00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:14,030
be a good idea it basically considers

00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:18,080
like three seconds laughed and went for

00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:20,930
a coffee and I felt like I could do more

00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:22,730
to improve the Python visibility the

00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:25,490
Python the way packed with people see

00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:28,400
Python in this PHP wall and after a

00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:30,530
couple of days where we try to do like

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,930
machine learning and kind of this kind

00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:35,360
of stuff they basically realized that

00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:38,420
python has numpy has Syfy has a scalar

00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:41,570
and SK imagine stuff so maybe a good

00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:44,660
idea to two point that python is a good

00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:47,420
idea is it could be a good technology to

00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:50,050
use is to point out all the great great

00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:52,280
projects we have at some some

00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,830
programming language like I think page

00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:56,990
we don't have and I'm thinking about

00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:59,000
numpy I'm thinking about like a side by

00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:02,420
and think of our requests that this only

00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,160
library like HTTP requests we can do so

00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:06,890
much better than other programming

00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,860
languages so maybe advocating python by

00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:14,450
the example showing code snippets where

00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:15,920
how can you do a HTTP request in PHP 25

00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:18,470
lines we can do that in one line that's

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,440
a traffic maybe showing examples like

00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:23,630
that could improve the video the the way

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,490
people see both in my honor yeah it's

00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:28,100
exactly what we do with web 2 pi because

00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:31,580
web two pies we also use requests in

00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:33,470
their web 2 pi is very very fast set up

00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:36,760
and configure then and everything and

00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,760
usually amazes people

00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:50,920
what other technologies did you consider

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,380
for example did you consider no skala or

00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:57,720
anything like that and what made you

00:52:53,380 --> 00:53:00,339
decide against them we considered the

00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,940
the languages which were already on our

00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:05,920
stack on now stack and puffin was it

00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:08,410
wasn't mentioned because I only was the

00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:11,170
only one using it so no we did not we

00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:13,810
just what was on the stack like Delfino

00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:16,750
no brain area chava really a

00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:19,900
consideration verve the C++ and C

00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:21,580
basically and be the reason was that we

00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:26,740
did not want to take a technology which

00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:44,290
nobody knows and I also wanted to do

00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:47,410
spike any other question did you ever

00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:49,119
run into any technical blocker technical

00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:51,490
difficulties using Python opposed

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,760
opposed to other languages because they

00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:56,589
can make an example working on research

00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:58,300
institute which work mainly in genomic

00:53:56,589 --> 00:54:01,210
stuff and we also have a spin-off

00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:05,589
commercial company we tried really oh I

00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:08,560
am this is admin route beware we tried

00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:10,290
really hard to push I s probably the

00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,510
only one in the conference I think

00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:15,310
everyone's always blaming sysadmin we

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,530
tried really hard to push Python as a

00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:20,589
main language for most of the staff or

00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:23,880
at least try to replace all the perl

00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:28,030
scripting & bash scripting stuff we had

00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:29,980
but in fact we hit after we convinced

00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,420
some people we started to use it and

00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:34,240
then we hit the technical difficulty

00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:38,470
because the red line is the rib is love

00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:41,260
humberto where an example did you ever

00:54:38,470 --> 00:54:43,960
find any similar issue in your

00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:47,890
experience or any suggestion of to

00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:52,630
overcome this in some way and push the

00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:54,880
language father in usage no at the

00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:56,770
moment we are lucky we could solve old I

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,830
mean there are always top sacks we could

00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:02,050
solve them and if there are really very

00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:04,420
very specific problems especially

00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:08,200
related to speed i mean the channel

00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:10,900
suggestion is to use a c function for it

00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,760
and bind it to pine for example but i

00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,369
would say if it's really extremely big

00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,470
the difference I think it's someone

00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:18,940
should review the code may be the wrong

00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:21,790
library was used or the wrong type of

00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:25,510
parsing cannot say but at the moment we

00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:33,220
were lucky we had no really am no dead

00:55:25,510 --> 00:55:35,859
ends I'd say okay thank you okay me time

00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:37,990
is over but five minutes or so we'll

00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:41,560
start with next talk about one goggle

00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:43,620
system thank you for watching

00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:43,620
