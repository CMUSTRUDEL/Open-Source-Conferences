	00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,560
okay yeah um so that's so hi everybody

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:10,679
I'm not going to give a lot to talk

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,269
about about things during the conference

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,950
many people have approached me and I

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,330
think also they have been discussions

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,070
among people I wasn't participating and

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:22,109
what I would like to do in this session

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,230
there's also kind of a follow-up session

00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,060
at I think six or half-past six so it

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,939
can continue in the idea of that session

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,270
actually at six half past six is to

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,489
continue and then walk I beer and you

00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:37,440
know discuss there so what I would like

00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,590
to do is I hope that some people

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,210
actually who talked to me i am i'm not

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,410
sure how many of those actually here now

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:49,170
but i'd like to have people who have

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:53,550
ideas about particular things on how to

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,219
do them be it EGP key distribution mesh

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,489
networks you know all kinds of things or

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,230
even things based on WebRTC or basically

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:05,729
rough ideas and what would be

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,640
interesting to you to actually speak up

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:11,909
and then we split it's my suggestion

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,159
into little groups because obviously if

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:17,759
we are like like 30 people or something

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,100
it's not really good to have a 30 people

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,130
discussion so I'd rather like to split

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,400
into little groups discussing matters

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:30,290
and for that i would like to ask people

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,460
if they are if they want to basically

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,259
present some ideas that they had in

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,920
conjunction with what i talked about on

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,840
monday and a particular bida statement

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,680
or some kind of area of interest and

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,240
then we try to split up a bit further in

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:50,909
with into little groups

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:55,000
no anybody we would like to start

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,680
something right and I'm just going to

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,470
make notes so that we keep a track

00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,479
record basically of like ideas and then

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,610
we can distribute accordingly and if

00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,979
that doesn't work I would spill still

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,450
like to split up into groups because

00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:08,890
otherwise it's just so that a few people

00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,959
will talk and the others will just

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,120
listen and I would rather like to have a

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:18,940
bit more of an engaged like peer to peer

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:26,950
discussion you know yes I put it up now

00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:30,100
here and yes okay so anybody yes um yeah

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:32,709
my name is Balthazar I approached Hager

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:36,010
after historic on Monday and I told him

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:38,290
that though he mentioned Edward the case

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,650
of Edward Snowden and the NSA in prison

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,989
and he basically are we during this time

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,049
we actually learned that in France I'm

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:50,700
France we have the exact same software

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,799
running and we have like six different

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:55,810
groups of people like the equivalent of

00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:57,340
the NSA the equivalent of the CIA in

00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,530
France I can have access to this

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:01,150
database so this is kind of scary and I

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,850
went to him and said but you fail to

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,920
mention a website is called prison break

00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:11,290
I know if anybody has heard of this

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:13,239
website prison break the org yep so on

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,549
this website you can find open source

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,370
and free software actually alternatives

00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:20,980
to a lot of commercial software OS is

00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,040
like windows of course but voice like

00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,220
skype a lot of things and among them I

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,030
found two of them that really

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,540
interesting but it's not really

00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:34,410
peer-to-peer so that's why I'm okay but

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:37,030
then I will just talk about them anyway

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,200
they're made by the same company called

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,870
whisper something something sorry yes

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:47,709
exactly and they're called tech secure

00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,690
and red phone and the idea is super

00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:51,609
simple but seems really powerful and I

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,729
would like to discuss about it to people

00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:58,150
interested so you the tech secure thing

00:03:54,729 --> 00:04:00,640
they both work with a public and private

00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:02,530
key security

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,010
RSA encryption and basically the first

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:09,280
one the tech sector one will encrypt all

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:12,880
your local text messages and will

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,550
actually encrypt the outgoing messages

00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,799
if the other person you're talking to is

00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,440
also using tech secure and it will do

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,150
the others are the exact same thing at

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,910
the other people on the other person

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,940
phone sorry and it's just a regular text

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,680
messaging thing text messaging app if

00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:33,460
the other person is not using textsecure

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,370
so I think it's really easy programs to

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,380
master and it could be a good way to

00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,150
secure your communications the other one

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:42,460
is just using the same thing but for

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:44,710
voice over other telephone so we will

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,950
encrypt your voice and decrypt it on the

00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:51,010
fly the other people's phone so yeah

00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,600
I've tested one of them and if some

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,310
people won't actually install them on

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,990
the phone and try and see it working it

00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,870
could be really cool and that's pretty

00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:04,930
much it and it's pretty much it not

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:07,120
pretty much yes exactly and seeing

00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,669
them working because i've i've installed

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,880
the thing but i've never used the PGP

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:14,440
the year sorry the the RSA encryption so

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,260
I'm just saving plain text text

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,000
messaging text messages and and it I

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,560
actually don't know if it works so it

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,560
seems cool but I haven't seen working

00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:31,879
it's sorry it I don't know actually I

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:33,409
haven't Android I know but but though if

00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,300
you install I'm sorry to troll but if

00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:37,849
you install if you have an iPhone and

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,709
you try to security communications it's

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:43,789
like trying a patch a sinking boat maybe

00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:47,629
I don't know I'm and we end up the troll

00:05:43,789 --> 00:05:55,909
and thank you for attention Oh anybody

00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:57,580
else I guess it's from bit BitTorrent

00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:11,959
Inc I think and it's still in alpha

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:14,349
Prisca with ska like pris ka and yeah

00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:14,349
it's called

00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:19,939
it's called a BitTorrent sync it's still

00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:21,379
an iphone but it's like an alternative

00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:23,330
to drop box that will store the data

00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:24,620
locally and even like I don't have a

00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,059
server at home but I use it on my

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,909
computer and then it will sync whenever

00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:30,259
I go online I don't rely on it yet

00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:33,680
because it's in this early stage but

00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:35,629
it's interesting to try out i think i've

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,979
had it for like i think two months but

00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:41,270
like yeah something like it i haven't

00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:49,969
haven't checked the source if it's open

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:53,469
source oh okay thank you does anyone

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:53,469
else have something they want to add

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:10,800
thank you yeah my name is Batman I have

00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,890
an idea for a project that would be

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,770
called the bat work it's a network but

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:23,370
it uses it uses audio for communication

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:25,050
maybe in a you have heard from an

00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:28,200
example project in the Netherlands

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:31,200
there's a you can go visit a cinema and

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:33,210
I have a film and if the one of the main

00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,570
role characters receives a text message

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,160
you receive it as well on your phone

00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,860
this signal is transmitted the in the

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,710
ultrasonic field and but the same

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,840
technology you can apply for ad hoc

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:51,450
networking with very very minimalistic

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,640
bandwidth of course but I idea occurred

00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,050
to me when I was looking for my

00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,760
colleagues and I wanted to watch septum

00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:58,440
but I had no connection at all but I

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,130
knew that there's tons of people with

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:05,850
laptops and handheld devices Android you

00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:09,170
name it smartphones so yeah if you could

00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:13,340
somehow utilize their ability to

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:18,300
communicate and I have did a smaller

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:23,640
experiment sending a Morse code very

00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:26,520
basic example pay why th 0 n and parsing

00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,470
that with another laptop and it's still

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,580
very experimental code but if anybody

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:35,130
feels like our this is a nice like toy

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:40,500
project which can grow and maybe scale

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:42,210
up to instead of Morse user like like an

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,490
old modem or a fox modem and this kind

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,670
of stuff and scale it further and I

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,590
don't know it's just toilet project

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,510
maybe just exchange thoughts on this and

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,510
maybe let it grow that's it

00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:03,560
while talking recently some days ago

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:07,940
there came up the idea that we could

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:11,180
maybe use a gpg public key on a server

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:14,029
and base the authentication for this web

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,040
application on the public key so it

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,709
basically checks whether the user has

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,970
the corresponding private key either by

00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:24,829
signing something or by encrypting

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:28,970
something maybe in a sort of challenge

00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:32,000
response way and so this solves maybe

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:34,699
two problems hey you have a rather

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,579
secure authentication you don't need to

00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:40,639
store a password that could be hacked by

00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:43,610
brute forcing it and you would even have

00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,980
the public key of many users on that

00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:51,459
server so it would be sort of a public

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,459
key so of all so maybe that's the idea

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,930
you

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,550
this is a bit is it haven't completely

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,760
thought but I think thinking about the

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:18,889
Wi-Fi Wi-Fi networks in the end so i

00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:21,389
have thinking about a bit how to

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:24,690
essentially in the end the worldwide

00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:27,000
mesh network where you where we either

00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:29,730
make hardware or or a software

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,769
distribution for routers where you where

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,529
they will form a mesh network with your

00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:37,519
neighbors and still so similar to the

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:52,230
project span that Olga was talking about

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:57,779
but just sort of a brain dump ok so I've

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:59,459
also just two short bits and what marks

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,310
tens of discussions I had with people

00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:04,769
one is the fajar em but is I think not

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,720
hear from OpenStack yes we were thinking

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,620
about brainstorming and our already

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,279
about a project that we for talking

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,569
about it named friend cloud and friend

00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,730
cloud would be something where you

00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:20,130
basically have resources and you allow

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,880
your friends to also and resources in

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:26,339
the sense of a vm like no running code

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,470
on something and i would basically allow

00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:31,740
friends of me to use that and maybe also

00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,810
friends of friends so it's not a public

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,899
cloud so that basically anyone can run

00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:40,019
anything but rather something where you

00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:42,029
allow friends to access resources and by

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:43,620
sharing those you suddenly get you can

00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,110
use that for testing or something like

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,699
this but also even for like in the long

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,149
run also for running services all of

00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:55,100
that especially if those nodes have

00:11:51,149 --> 00:12:00,779
internet connectivity so kind of like a

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:03,089
federated shrimp paste clout so that's

00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:06,769
something I'm also interested in I kind

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,769
of tape type at the same time so

00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:13,490
that's one thing and a number of

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:17,720
discussions were held on pgp key

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:21,050
distribution and the key distribution

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,520
thing is a big problem and basically I

00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,410
mean how do you know if you have a

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,770
certain target address like an email

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:28,880
address what is exactly the fitting

00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:31,340
public key because once you know that

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,040
it's very easy to encrypt the message

00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:36,920
and then the person who gets it can

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:40,640
decrypt it and so this kind of key

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:42,500
discovery and key finding the RPG p

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:44,450
service but it's not I mean they might

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,720
have basically arbitrary PGP keys

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,580
registered for the email address and the

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,670
relation basically going from the email

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:56,540
address for pgp is not what a safe one

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:58,550
basically and there was one idea which I

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:03,410
liked and discussed a bit with some

00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:07,190
people which is for example distributing

00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:09,230
the keys with each male so when I'm

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,260
sending a mail to a mailing list or when

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm sending a mail to a friend that I

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:20,300
basically add the public key my public

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,980
key to every male you know and that

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,230
means that if somebody if basically your

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:27,380
mail client just sees that header it

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,210
just straws those PGT keys like from

00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,950
multiple people and then when I'm a

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:33,320
client actually wants to send out a male

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:36,740
it looks up in this local storage do I

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:40,250
have that pgp key and if yet yes yes yes

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:43,090
I just encrypted now of course this is

00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:45,410
only enough against the passive attack

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:48,140
you know the difference between passive

00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:49,550
and active attacks I think passive

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,740
attacks are just somebody recording

00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:53,630
things that's basically most of what is

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,030
currently happening probably active

00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:58,850
attacks is if somebody really gets into

00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,980
the wire and pretends to the one side to

00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,770
be the one person and to the other side

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:07,340
to be like the other and that's why if I

00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:09,560
send you a pgp key then somebody can

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,110
basically intercept it send another pgp

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,660
key and then when that person thinks he

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,670
has the right pgp key hee hee encrypts

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:19,160
and but the men in the middle actually

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,690
gets the real text and I get the message

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,270
with my pgp key

00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,240
so for me everything appears fine that's

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:29,090
the classical active men in the middle

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,270
attack so the crypto communities have

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:35,000
been focusing these cuts of F at X very

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:39,230
much and basically my idea and this is

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,300
that that's great but by focusing on

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,390
this men in the middle of texts it

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:47,090
became so hard to do key exchange that

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:50,000
nobody does it and we are even open to

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:51,950
passive attacks you know so we're

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,030
basically trying to fight one thing

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,340
don't manage it because it's so

00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:58,250
inconvenient to do that it's very hard

00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,780
to do the trust thing there that we

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,690
don't even have protection against basic

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,760
snooping and that's a bad outcome I

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,580
think so I personally think but that's

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,410
my opinion it's better to first focus on

00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,780
getting the passive attacks sort it out

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,880
and then move on to actually also guard

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:19,040
against active attacks okay so these

00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:22,580
were like two separate discussion things

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,950
I discussion topics I basically had key

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:29,360
distribution because it underlies many

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:33,860
of the of the current questions on how

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,350
to do this so I think I mean let's see

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,120
if we can split up I mean I think each

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:40,460
group shouldn't have more than six or

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,380
seven people so even if ten people are

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:45,890
interested in the same topic or so they

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:48,320
should just still get together we don't

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:51,350
have that much time now like I said at

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,540
six o'clock it's going or 6 30 or six

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,890
I'm not sure it's on the table it's

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,590
anyway going to continue and then

00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:01,940
there's a bit of a more open-ended pie

00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:04,700
beer discussion so maybe instead of like

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,640
doing voting and you know all this maybe

00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:11,270
we just make make it really like row

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,650
wise that five people basically get

00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,790
together and then they decide on what

00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:16,460
kind of topic they actually want to

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:20,480
discuss it's probably easier than making

00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:23,690
complicated distribution optimizations

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,520
now so if that's fine with you then we

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,200
just stop at that and then we take it

00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:29,900
from there and who is still interested

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,240
then we basically we couldn't try to

00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,260
make a closing session but I mean in

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,220
this session there's only 10 minutes

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,290
left so let's

00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:39,050
just get started a bit and then maybe

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,840
agreed to meet up again at those who are

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:45,140
interested at six and bit past six and

00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,660
then continue from there okay so just do

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,060
like two rows everywhere and decide on

00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,720
what you are interested in and discuss

00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,720
