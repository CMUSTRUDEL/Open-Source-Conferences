so I'm just going to use that so the

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,929
difference between our head and I get

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,790
it's not very obvious for a lot of

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,920
people but you really want like if you

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:21,060
want to check if your content areas here

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:26,390
it's been created or what which one are

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,390
the cnx one sorry sorry I say here we go

00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:34,649
now it for a little bit

00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,680
so if you guys like we D like beef and

00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:47,670
if you already finished like we said

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:52,030
that stuff until the other ones finished

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:55,120
you can you can bother you can boss your

00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,000
facebook or you can look over like the

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,800
Swift dash dash help and you can see all

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,680
the options you can do by default like

00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,619
with the CLI and you can try stuff with

00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:11,770
it personally don't care you can park it

00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:13,119
it's just a game and the cool thing is

00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:15,430
like you can try with the dash dash

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,380
debug so you can know exactly what the

00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,780
API is doing was the CLA is doing with

00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,759
the API so whenever you're going to

00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:25,479
write an app that's going to use the

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,460
Swift API you going to you're going to

00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,430
try that the stuff that is doing on SI

00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,649
la vista dr debug and you can implement

00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,479
that on your on your whatever

00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:36,970
programming language you're using her do

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,619
that but usually you'll use the Swift

00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:43,300
client and you just do stuff with it so

00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:46,179
if clients is just it's pretty

00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:49,450
straightforward it does i as a few

00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:55,110
methods now your certificate and after

00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:55,110
you just post but get get it hey

00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:03,380
so if you okay so if you specify like

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:07,550
order password like in your when you

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:09,230
kick the club instead of admin you know

00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,630
when you ask you like when you studied

00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:15,740
like to do the attack did he ask you for

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:17,090
a password isn't it so on key you're not

00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:24,710
going to put admin but you can to put

00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:27,080
your key I think the nice things like I

00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:30,020
know it's the other like two demo if you

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,400
install your own cloud but at least you

00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:34,100
know to install the Deaf stack and it's

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,770
you truly it's really a really important

00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,960
that you would not do that because you

00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:43,520
can really experiment OpenStack with

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,080
this tacky if you want if you want like

00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:48,230
to experiment the deployment there's

00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:51,170
other tools this pack stack there's a

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:55,040
pack study I hear that does use puppet

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:58,340
on the back end to a deploy like I think

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,400
and it does Rackspace out now doesn't

00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,280
know what should you do nothing either

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,360
yeah but you have a deeper now you have

00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,430
like just the RCP stuff yeah but that's

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:18,520
a more global for it's not just for

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:22,760
trying out quickly distribution second

00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:25,700
recipes cloud distribution okay there's

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,800
a ad from rackspace you get the Dead

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,770
City they can another thing is a USB

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,600
nuts yeah it's actually pretty cool a

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,890
special friend of mine who is working on

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:40,570
a tail they are all all of my tits my ex

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,570
team on my ex

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,730
so yeah

00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,970
you

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,120
and a data as well into it when you do a

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:08,400
post so you can do like post containers

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:12,000
and you can specify the header so you're

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,750
just going to say my name and addresses

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:23,989
are either thing is like a full equal

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:23,989
bar and if you do cns

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:37,530
I don't know wait wait doesn't put that

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:39,840
thing all I need to try to run I need to

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,250
look for it doesn't worth nothing anyway

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,720
you get the stats and you get the other

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:51,389
clients what's the other stuff I wanted

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:53,580
to show you or I could show you the the

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,530
proxy so yeah something i wanted to show

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:58,169
is that are I know if you guys came at

00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,990
the swifter mice we've talked this

00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:04,680
morning is that explaining all the

00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:06,509
features of Swift so you get you get a

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,340
lot of different stuff in the pipeline

00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:11,520
that's the pipe and the whiskey pipeline

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,460
so so just quickly like just to explain

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,979
how it works is that you get you get an

00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,310
entry point so usually we prologue the

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:21,840
cashier also at first and after it takes

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,610
the request and you're just going to

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,880
pass through and give to a bunch of

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,520
other people so so you have like bunch

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,699
of standard modules which is the logging

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,009
the cash and the large object anyway

00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,000
rightly meeting and that's all stock and

00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:40,469
that's the thing I was talking about

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,270
before does the does that's that modular

00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:44,639
provided by Python kiss on clients not

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,860
even in Swift and that's the one is

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,919
going to validate that X of token thing

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,570
and it's going to pass the Keystone oath

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,110
and the Keystone nose is going to be the

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,610
one who's going to validate that the

00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:59,039
groups and stuff like that and then

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,020
going to do the AC else and after you

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,440
get like all those feature like 10 / us

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,229
forum post like to be able to do a post

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,810
directly from the browser and a static

00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:13,080
web and stuff that's all the future you

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:18,389
can install new cloud it's a ton of

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,069
stuff there is a I don't know if I

00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,800
didn't prepare but i think i will be a

00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:25,800
good idea to do a demonstration like

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,419
quickly or to do a whiskey whiskey

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,069
middleware my car to do like so

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,969
basically or to add features the idea

00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:34,979
into Swift but uh yeah it's probably out

00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:36,569
of scope because this model is like you

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,620
really need to know how to do whiskey

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:41,040
middleware and after

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,440
that's pretty easy and better there is a

00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,810
great article on the some website I

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,490
think he's called Julian donchu or what

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:51,020
like an article like a long article I

00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:54,030
but ought to wrote our sweet middleware

00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:56,699
ought to write as if to though and it's

00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,139
like that it's a lot of french guy it's

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:03,810
actually the centimeter peak here as

00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:06,510
well so if you google this name and

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,100
Swift just fine he has like some

00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,530
articles i would ought to write them in

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:16,050
dover probably should write one as well

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:17,550
one day we go don't move so is that

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:22,729
clear enough for swift i think it's

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:27,410
pretty simple so no confusing face

00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,410
facebooking twitter tired

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:40,010
oh sorry that's when you do like the

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,170
source open RC devstack it's the one is

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:51,550
going to define so solo que like another

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:53,810
available so you do source open our CSI

00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:57,260
ok so the password you don't have to

00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,180
clear and you see like it's going to

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,000
show all of them so those want to stand

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,860
out like on all clients as the one that

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,690
opens like they're going to use so you

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,730
don't have to specify manually dash dash

00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:13,220
or ester not its use your name as well

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:17,060
so if you do the help you can see there

00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,530
is a little bit of stuff so you can

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,270
synchronize as well the electro you and

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,770
stuff like that but all those options

00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,480
that the stuff that we have to put

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,910
manually if you did not have the

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,950
argument viable and believe me young a

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,470
lesson trying to list all of that now

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,460
with my weird accent as well he'll be

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,020
dying i'll be spending all night here it

00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,330
was much easier to show the opener see

00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,280
but if you do the source open asking you

00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,050
do like all to see all your game

00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:47,180
available I've grip OS on the scope

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:49,970
you'll see all of them yeah this one is

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:53,920
like always no cash so it doesn't catch

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,920
tightly yeah sorry

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,720
it

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,040
SI

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,120
they will be finished enough

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,960
that's a long room this is the

00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:33,790
connection yeah and I try to do

00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:39,730
something like this this should exist

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:42,370
here I get this okay so EG i was much so

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,750
did he change the the key did you change

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,300
when you install to install you're just

00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:48,520
like yourself is dead yeah yeah so your

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,530
password if you read your password is

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,200
that so you need to use that password so

00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:57,210
that is yes I was explaining before yeah

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,210
okay nice cool

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:11,810
okay I like it but yeah and then also it

00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:14,709
is devo tipo de moya sit and now good

00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,709
please check

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,170
all right so I guess so yeah we don't

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:33,380
need more for now but i'm here if you

00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,060
have any questions and i can be actually

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,430
need to talk and also try up and

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,970
starting over but also as I said before

00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:43,190
like it it's not really it's it's not

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:44,870
atomic science you know it's very simple

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:47,150
you just pin a dead stacking just try

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:53,800
stuff and you'll see how it works now a

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:53,800
table questions

00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,810
everything works for everyone I'm

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:05,020
surprised we actually met something that

00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,020
works

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:24,540
okay thank you okay thanks everybody for

00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:28,680
coming and attending the training

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:31,529
session of us I hope it was useful to PC

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,690
also please go and write us if you liked

00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:37,380
