the bottom right so we are basically now

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:36,840
down to workable size Balthazar has set

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:42,329
up a mailing list here this one okay the

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,910
endless knot there like that so how that

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:46,500
works if you want to I mean the idea of

00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:52,050
that Magnus especially to continue to

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:55,640
exchange ideas there and it's more of a

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,870
bootstrapping thing because maybe I mean

00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,809
that's the idea to also just set up a

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:02,100
great project to actually list

00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:06,439
interesting existing projects and

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,720
interesting project ideas so that people

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:11,850
who want to join basically and doing

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:17,100
things are discussing things can can use

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,600
that to orient and unless I mean I don't

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,640
know if there is do you know of any

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,229
sites that actually try to list all

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,670
currently an imprisoned break for

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:28,650
example is something that lists

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:31,020
applications yes more developer oriented

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,820
and basically like ongoing hacking

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,710
projects that try to do something I mean

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:39,409
I know for example about I don't know

00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:42,210
have you heard of this project whole CC

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:43,740
it's I think it's just announced since I

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,380
don't know 23 weeks or something like

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:55,020
this it's a it's a peer-to-peer social

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:58,590
networking project and it basically is

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,670
implemented is implementing goal and it

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,469
produces a standalone executable that is

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,090
an endpoint for a browser so you can

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:07,940
just point your browser to it and you

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,570
kind of can just put it on to

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,240
OS X or Windows or Linux so it's very

00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:16,370
cross platform and its standalone so you

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,030
don't need to like install pip

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:22,010
setuptools to and then you actually

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,280
PowerPoint a browser to it and you

00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:27,800
publish a message and that this social

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,310
networking site then it's it stores it

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,590
in the local node and then that local

00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:37,340
mode actually sends it to other

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,620
interested nodes who also have a browser

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,720
attached and then you can actually see

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:48,230
it just like in a normal I think they

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,240
have a nice web interface so it's it's

00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,470
an interesting architecture I think for

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:56,270
this kind of application and there's

00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,740
there's some other projects I think I

00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:01,130
mean some I mentioned in my talk and

00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,800
monday and i'm sure there are others i

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:11,560
mean some people mentioned here earlier

00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:11,560
on today that one about what was it the

00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:21,380
no it was is it here BitTorrent sync so

00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:22,580
much for example and i think there's a

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,160
number of other projects that are

00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:26,180
currently ongoing that would be

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,530
interesting so what I would be

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,239
interested in is actually having a

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:31,130
github project which basically is

00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,800
currently just on a bunch of text files

00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,720
that gets may be turned into a web page

00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:40,340
like using restructure text or something

00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:42,590
it has a project and then a description

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,750
and a link to it basically so just kind

00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:50,780
of like a directory of currently ongoing

00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:51,830
projects and index yes but I i don't

00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,660
know i mean the problem i have with

00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,100
Vicky's is usually that I mean get up

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,340
something like this it's very easy to

00:03:55,100 --> 00:04:00,620
use my own like local environment you

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,959
know just type something use my local

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,290
tools and then I basically submit it to

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,290
someone

00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:20,670
yes I mean wiki's awesome lines of

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:22,500
course yes yes other words what I was

00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:28,200
thinking I mean a project directly

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:29,760
basically you think I mean I it's not

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,560
like I haven't I have not really a

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,910
program or something so I really even

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,000
though I'm standing here and I have the

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:41,040
microphone and I don't really intend

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,290
this to be like a front thing or so so

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
it's basically also bouncing some ideas

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,650
and I personally I like this idea of

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,200
getting a bit of a better overview of

00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,200
interesting projects that are ongoing

00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,800
because I'm get up there's something

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,910
like how many three million projects as

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,740
far as I know or three million

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,480
repositories which probably also have

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,120
partly fox or other stuff so it's not

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,900
maybe not unique project I don't know

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,750
but it's a lot so it's not so easy these

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,120
days like it was like 10 years ago to

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:21,630
actually find stuff that's interesting

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:24,600
and that people are doing already you

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,900
should ask yes they should have an

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,900
overview

00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:35,980
if they're they they probably have an

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:37,930
overview yes okay so um I mean we just

00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,590
do a nothing to hide github thing to

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,590
just keep it the same

00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:03,360
this way better than a bucket is perfect

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:08,340
along with pockets you have a miracle

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:13,020
you like organization as more than five

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:17,250
minutes and give half of icing I think

00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:21,539
we should check it because maybe it it

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:27,060
applies only when you may be the place

00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:29,370
for me to try sir oh yes you have who

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,770
I'm sorry I didn't give it like

00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:37,380
bitbucket you have unlimited number of

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:40,199
private yes you can only have five team

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,050
members that has successfully priority

00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,690
okay he wants to have more decision I

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:49,199
don't invite someone's so we can get you

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,360
extra or you can pay I see but I mean if

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,340
you're not out to private repository

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,740
it's not really sure i think it is not

00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:59,010
but this company is a good idea because

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:02,340
we can get the hosting for freezer is

00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:05,039
the page rank as well fine there's the

00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,389
library called jaco that they use the

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,389
grandeur pages food

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,590
yes I mean I would be very happy if

00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:15,330
somebody sets this up because I'm not

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,180
that familiar with github I'm more like

00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,910
so far just used projects or maybe the

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:27,030
deliver for us all but not really set up

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,650
things so we could actually just and I

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,570
mean try to do that now I don't know

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,190
it's a bit the question what I mean

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:34,710
that's very first ask I mean what would

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:36,810
you like to do actually I mean I would

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,690
like to talk about this kind of like

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,640
what to do after the conference so like

00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,300
this github and the mailing list and

00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,530
then take it from there but also we can

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:52,160
like use the time right now to actually

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,160
discuss some things or

00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,940
yes I mean that's a bit of a question of

00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:05,960
what we what we want I mean I would like

00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:08,270
to write well I am I mean you can also

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,400
just collect stuff that V in this room

00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:13,070
currently no and put it in this if I bet

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,960
that that can then you know you can just

00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:21,140
go to this URL up there and just add

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:23,270
things that you know right now and then

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,910
somebody can just like transfer this to

00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:36,140
restructure text on the use with such a

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:37,220
text i'll get up usually only yes anyway

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:50,600
it's not not such a big difference

00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:53,560
actually Oliver I our libraries yes I

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,560
know

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:03,910
you can apply some yogurt yeah I'm fine

00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:10,390
to just go with something simple I mean

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:14,050
for now whatever actually works so I

00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:17,080
mean lets you go to this etherpad then

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:24,670
you can just start adding projects so we

00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:26,650
basically have an initial list yes yes

00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:29,740
but do you think you should like really

00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:40,560
do an organization already that's the

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:40,560
best way you can other people

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:53,930
if you'd like to create the user have

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,930
everybody do to treat for example

00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:00,830
password

00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:03,150
tracks sure basically one idea

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,640
organization could could we have this

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,330
name nothing to hide but if we want to

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,610
make only a documentation projectionist

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:14,040
maybe should not take this name because

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,600
if you want to work in a software later

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:28,410
maybe the software wants to have that

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:31,790
name when we we can reserve it I just

00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:34,260
mean don't give the name to the

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,080
documentation thing but rather maybe

00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,320
later for the software but reserved both

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:43,650
maybe mm-hm but if you have an

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,660
organization nothing to hide then you

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:49,770
can still do in repository hang tight I

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,690
mean I don't currently think that I mean

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,660
I don't really know where this goes but

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:57,690
I would currently just focus it on this

00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,520
kind of project index and idea

00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:02,040
collection and has the meaningless to

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,640
like having a discussion scream but then

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,500
if I mean I don't really know if

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,190
basically this is going to be the

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:15,480
hosting umbrella for like actual

00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,860
projects maybe but I I would just be

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:20,190
happy currently to just have this

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:24,930
project index and add things do that and

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:30,360
have maybe the starting content just be

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:31,980
put in here and I mean if somebody can

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,350
set up the organization and then put a

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:41,880
few people in I mean if you write your

00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:49,200
get up things briefly into the etherpad

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:51,410
up here then Baltazar maybe can just add

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,410
them

00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:03,220
actually I don't want to use that but no

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,870
actually I don't want really what now

00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:08,360
yes I have all right exactly yes you're

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:11,600
right I'm not just this yes I just

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,329
switched that actually yes so just add

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,110
yours and then you can add the

00:12:14,329 --> 00:12:17,110
organization

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:52,430
like

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:58,370
I get Rick and give 500 and now I'm

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:02,050
trying to recreate organization

00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,050
but the name is always ended by me

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:19,280
maybe never blacklist oh ok let me say

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:22,640
so I got some time agency the place NSA

00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,860
nothing draw an IV boxes what it's

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:32,810
taking I guess Inez is already taking a

00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:36,380
smokin ization how is it taken there's

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:39,980
no such agency yes actually I have a on

00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:42,890
the pie test channel our IRC bot is

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:46,900
called the B and D and B Indies the

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:46,900
Drummond NSA basically

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,660
for the

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:17,880
if you like oh yes yes for now yes I

00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:20,260
mean you can't see it um all this I

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:26,079
don't really kiss back to mine currently

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:29,130
yes and let's start like this and yes

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,130
there's no

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:02,980
I mean what I would like to work almost

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,570
partly motivated by the windows on the

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,850
one hand you can just basically list all

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,010
the existing projects but they have

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:12,430
certain properties and for me for

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,110
example the property if a project

00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,880
actually has an open source software

00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:20,710
stack is kind of important in that GDP

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,330
one point so for example space monkey or

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:26,500
skype they are peer-to-peer project like

00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:29,650
it used to be but in terms of the

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,020
property is it like transparent open

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:35,950
source software it's Marty weekend can't

00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:37,600
just do it that way to not miss them no

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,600
but it's no no no I think it's okay to

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,010
actually this dead why not I mean it's

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,750
not it's just about basically

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:46,360
understanding what kind of technology is

00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:47,920
currently used and yeah but but if there

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,230
is closed source software and it's

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,540
getting popular and if it has crypto the

00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:55,600
NSA is going to force them to the back

00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:59,500
door in there no sure I agree yes I mean

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:02,890
but that that can be basically explained

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,750
and can be explained in the text but I

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,460
mean why hide it I mean yes it's still I

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,650
mean it's interesting to know that skype

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:11,310
at least used to have a peer-to-peer

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:11,310
model and

00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:25,319
gee I t s why I'm not just type it I

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,319
mean

00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:41,920
you could type it in the etherpad or

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:46,670
okay because I don't see it currently

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,350
I'll just don't know just somewhere in

00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:49,939
between it it's not really solid yet I

00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:52,119
mean just put it somewhere where your

00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,119
cursor

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:10,480
everything okay

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,480
skype spaces and

00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,020
that's that

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,260
disconnected

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:24,600
and Wi-Fi

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,600
good

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:58,620
did see more don't move out what is it

00:17:38,400 --> 00:18:02,490
about actually i just i think i'm not

00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,790
sure didn't really didn't work out of

00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,790
the box

00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,840
actually I was actually bit disappointed

00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:13,150
because it sounded good but it sounded

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:17,800
good but this is just another observer

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:22,980
intense is slowly dying or but it looks

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,980
to me now that it's icy

00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:34,410
by doing that you see I don't know if

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:37,860
the current support that we have in

00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:40,110
Firefox and Chrome what kind of

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:44,940
encryption or if they do encryption I

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:46,920
don't really know no it you can't I mean

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,240
it's really a it really depends on what

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,970
the browser's how they talk to each

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,650
other and if they exchange keys maybe

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,050
they do what is called a diff ahem

00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:58,770
scheme which guards again passive

00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:03,440
attacks but not active but it's

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,440
basically like to see

00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,710
w goose is going to please

00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:23,840
yes web crypto web crypto account they

00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:31,330
just did a newer version of that two

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:31,330
weeks ago so yes

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,549
yes I don't know if it's currently like

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,360
we might be having the browser's already

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:39,360
in there don't really know

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,190
you sure but that yes no

00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,230
yes I think I mean one of the things is

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:01,300
that web RTC is actually used by I think

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:05,050
here's a list of companies currently

00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,850
building stuff on top of you know kind

00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,920
of unknown companies now at the moment

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,450
but they're all building stuff on top of

00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,450
a party see and

00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,340
oh that's very I mean the simple thing

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,790
thing you can do is you just use the

00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:38,530
publicly available f RT C F spot calm

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:40,240
and so now I'm here so you i mean i can

00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,880
paste one of you can actually join I

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:49,480
think not really too many where's the

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,340
etherpad yeah so the URL is basically

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,000
this if you have a relatively recent

00:20:51,340 --> 00:21:00,580
like firefox beta or firefox 22 or

00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:02,470
latest chrome stable yes exactly all of

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,350
the box actually yes so if you go to

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,820
that mmm it might work now I don't

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,620
really know it depends slight I mean

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:18,100
we're in the same wireless LAN but

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:21,040
somebody tries to join this room is

00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,070
false on somebody yes it's only for one

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:28,720
person you know one other person

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:33,460
probably tried to get in is anybody okay

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,160
let's just let's just do it again but so

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:42,550
I do it again and now only the person

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:44,590
wants to connect can use this all move

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:50,110
on to connect who is the latest firefox

00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:54,930
chrome you have okay then actually I

00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:54,930
just saw a message from this i'ma try Oh

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:06,000
yeah try it yeah try it so it might work

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:08,070
actually so anyway I mean this is the

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,970
way i do it i basically generated ul and

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,200
then i just sent this URL out of band to

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,970
wherever i want to connect to and

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,220
there's only one other person who can

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,080
join you know this this this service

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:22,260
only allows one person I mean there's

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,420
lots of other sites that offer something

00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:27,110
like mood to channel support but so

00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:27,110
sorry

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:48,500
it doesn't work really in all nothing

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,190
myself you can see yourself but that's

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:54,899
not now it's connecting now it's

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,489
actually trying to get us to connect

00:22:54,899 --> 00:23:03,649
directly I'm not really sure how good it

00:22:56,489 --> 00:23:06,690
is that you can see me now already had

00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:08,999
but you can't see me I mean it's it's a

00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:16,649
V directional and UDP connection ok

00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:19,739
that's good it doesn't yes yes but it

00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:22,200
also depends on like I mean in principle

00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:27,799
WebRTC is meant to connect through

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,799
multiple firewalls even but yes but it's

00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:33,200
you have to connect

00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:45,929
it's done by basically we both meet at

00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:50,820
that URL that URL knows what is our

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:52,470
outbound IP address right because it

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,420
sees it I mean just these are the packet

00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:59,220
comes from there then it basically tells

00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:01,230
ok now I'm do and through that you buy

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,160
it now and then you it doesn't UDP

00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:09,630
connection a UDP connect you and that

00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:11,750
means that the the two browsers through

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:15,380
the mediator can get to know each

00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:20,669
other's you repeal external facing

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:22,740
firewall address because all right when

00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:25,650
I do you repeat I go through some random

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,220
part on the firewall 57,000 something

00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:31,110
and when something comes to that part I

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,210
it gets mapped back to my to the client

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:36,270
behind the firewall like network address

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:40,290
translation and this information by this

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,510
IP address plus part number is exchanged

00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,630
between the two browsers and then the

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,730
browsers actually use this address will

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:53,490
appear thing to connect directly to each

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:56,120
other and depends slightly on firewall

00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:58,980
configurations so you can actually block

00:24:56,120 --> 00:25:01,590
UDP for example and some firewalls

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,150
actually do that but I've often found

00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:07,830
that they don't do it I mean which is

00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:09,419
fine because yes exactly but there are

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:12,360
some fireballs who try to prevent skype

00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:14,700
from doing that and then then it won't

00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:17,400
also work here why it doesn't work now i

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:21,350
don't know i mean it works for you yeah

00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:21,350
so it's the it's one directional yes

00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:32,990
I mean it might be a very special case

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,060
actually if both people are really

00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:41,600
behind the same file if they are

00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:46,670
basically in the same net worth not only

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:48,530
that but but basically I mean if I I

00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:51,620
don't really know I mean if you know

00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:55,010
usually the situation is that you are in

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:59,240
two distinctive networks and you have

00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:01,100
two distinctive firewalls and so

00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,140
basically I could try to use my phone to

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:06,320
get a data connection and then maybe it

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,180
just works because we are trying to I

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,410
mean the best thing we could possibly do

00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,690
is actually have a direct connection

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,770
between his left of our mind in this

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,320
wireless network we don't need any

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:16,850
firewall we could just you know but I

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:21,740
think don't thing is clever enough to

00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:23,840
get down to this level it could I think

00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,580
so yes I mean summer I could I mean

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,430
maybe you could just transfer your mac

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:33,710
address basically enough because when

00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:37,160
you maybe can do that but it is kind of

00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:41,010
hard because maybe it may happen that

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,060
you can do our own in turn your

00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:48,570
in both places for example it's the same

00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:52,980
IP network the network scare the same IP

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:57,890
address and the same sub mass so that

00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,890
will be freaky during the front

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:12,730
let me try and bite us I can you try

00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:16,530
that reducing

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,530
saying that's introducing

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,820
I mean on the web at the seaside they

00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:35,620
have a more detailed explanation of how

00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:43,559
it works in relation the protocol of it

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:43,559
does this up okay so now let's be good

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:52,150
okay Shannon audio yes but I've had this

00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:57,550
effect actually that it hangs I've had

00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:59,800
that as well at some point yes it might

00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,120
can you see me still yeah yeah so it

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,309
seems like the other direction is

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,860
somewhat problematic lyy ever I don't

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,480
know but it's also i mean the the bras i

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,740
mean they are still basically improving

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:14,380
this support of establishing the

00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,520
connections and i've had i've tried it

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,050
now in three occasions and two or of

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,730
those worked very well in the last one

00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,650
was problematic basically so it's not

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:30,760
like forget a safe bet you can just you

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:32,770
know always do it or so but it's it

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:37,540
worked for example between me and

00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:38,410
somebody in berlin very nicely and and

00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,059
also there might be better

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,570
implementations of the server i mean

00:28:40,059 --> 00:28:45,610
this is just i think it's from the team

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:50,440
from Mozilla and chrome they actually

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:52,240
implemented this F Sport app but there's

00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,940
also other endpoints you can use to

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,630
route and it's basically I know at least

00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,630
there is a

00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:07,940
no chairs implementation exert range and

00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:10,250
there's a node.js implementation of a

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,919
body see that basically insulin

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,929
implements this mediation part it's not

00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:17,270
a big library it's like a relatively

00:29:14,929 --> 00:29:19,820
small thing and then you run this and

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:21,890
then you use this and then you met this

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,419
interview with application and then

00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:28,039
browsers can use this to actually meet

00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:31,179
so it's kind of simple you can basically

00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:33,980
embed it in any kind of web server it's

00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:36,320
nothing much special how you actually

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:38,240
allow browsers to meet there like in

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:42,429
terms of authorization and so on is up

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:47,140
to you I mean I'm kind of happy to just

00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:50,960
generate random URL and send that around

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:55,280
but what I'm missing basically what I'm

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,130
missing is some support for multi people

00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:00,140
chats which is obviously a bit more

00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:04,669
interesting I mean it's more interesting

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:15,429
multi-payer things because it's a nice

00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:18,860
capture Wow myself you're here I see

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,150
okay all right what's a bit seems to

00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,289
have some kind of but that might

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,919
actually also be the wireless network

00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:27,440
here I mean in any case the person

00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,429
saying right woody I think that's

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,210
something very interesting I don't

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:34,850
really know how this is doable currently

00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:36,470
I think within a web page I mean this is

00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:38,360
if you look at the web participate i

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,850
think it's basically a very simple thing

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:43,520
what you need in terms of javascript

00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,659
because it's really a browser API but

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,700
like you have a huge library of there

00:30:44,659 --> 00:30:49,669
it's really just you know a call in to

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:53,240
the new w3c's than that it's kind of

00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:57,470
like a couple of lines of code and you

00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,299
can make multiple connections so you can

00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,370
basically not only be connected to one

00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:04,090
browser but also to the next one so it

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:06,730
should be possible actually to have a

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:09,280
motive here

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:11,500
or even one way of basically if you have

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,480
five people basically you could connect

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:15,309
to two or three of them and everybody

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,770
does and then you can see which of the

00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:20,530
connections work and route the data

00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:22,929
accordingly I'm just not sure how easy

00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:24,820
it is currently to implement that but

00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:28,179
all these companies i mentioned that

00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:33,130
they are actually doing a multi-user

00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:39,010
chat rooms so and they use web RTC so

00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:43,960
it's apparently possible okay so i think

00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:46,720
that's where party scene yeah that I

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,220
don't really know I mean yes it will it

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,720
will of it if it does if does currently

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,720
you have to track I don't really know

00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,960
nice rapport

00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,809
differently

00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,450
certificate

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:10,700
and you've got both connections to the

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:14,540
users

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,920
you can generate the same key and send

00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,580
it back to the user

00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,580
mhm

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:25,950
yes yes

00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:31,410
so that for example Pierce EDM is a

00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:42,300
project that thus the basically tries to

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:45,210
build a city and out of process and P is

00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:51,840
also let's see if I find that I don't

00:32:45,210 --> 00:33:00,660
know let's see I'm not sure I mean

00:32:51,840 --> 00:33:09,090
finding p is kind of hard yes okay let's

00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:12,500
see here to guess there would be a good

00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:19,020
hidden secret to call it spam I mean

00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:20,340
Stan yes okay yeah p.m. Jasper PE but

00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:26,670
obviously maybe or something like this

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:30,420
it's really as peer GS was also one

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:32,340
there's really a number of of JavaScript

00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:39,330
projects based on web RTC already up

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:43,920
here yeah does this one that's actually

00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:46,910
a good list by the way back to the

00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,910
encryption part

00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:55,160
the way I described that you have to

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,160
trust the because it

00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:04,870
yes it is sure but I mean if you if you

00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:09,639
as a client actually sent your public

00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:11,590
key but I mean if every any browser

00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:13,840
basically just generates a public key a

00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:16,480
random general I mean basically even for

00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:20,619
the session you know not just and then

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,149
you sent this and the others get it then

00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:24,669
you basically do the data connection

00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:26,500
using this and you know which browser

00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:31,090
you are addressing so you can use that

00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:32,679
particular public key for encryption and

00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:36,210
then all these things are basically

00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,210
encrypted and only the load with the

00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,400
yes I mean in this in this web RTC

00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:53,730
connection that we had between my place

00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:58,290
and diane burton we had something like

00:34:53,730 --> 00:35:00,390
it was a good um good picture it was

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:04,770
something I mean higher resolution fan

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:06,540
of it was 200 kilobytes per second and I

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,060
would expect that that's possible I mean

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:13,650
yeah that's not really a big deal to

00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,970
have 200 kilobytes per second and in a

00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:16,830
native API I mean if you do it in

00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:21,420
JavaScript I don't know but if you do it

00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:24,810
natively like and C or C++ that you

00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,450
maybe can use public he's down only four

00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:33,570
settings so yeah that's true then switch

00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:38,310
to a yes exactly right yes problem right

00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:41,580
we use it even to write this so if it

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:43,910
would be this low yeah it's from usually

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,250
use you can use public key encryption

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:50,880
schemes to set up synchronous secrets

00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:56,730
sorry symmetric secrets and then use

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:59,550
this on both ends it's not easier yes so

00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,720
and that the I mean I guess that the

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:05,420
browser's are going to learn this

00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:08,070
natively through this web crypto API so

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,870
it shouldn't be something that yet that

00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,220
we that you need to bother much them

00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:14,220
from the application that will basically

00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:17,660
I still don't know how they're currently

00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,660
doing this

00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,510
yes shall we may be going to be the

00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:33,580
power because yes already developed you

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:45,000
hear a little bit yes that's so that

00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:45,000
it's the big stuff here it was so

00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,840
squall one line up

00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:06,069
right

00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:10,809
alright so the idea was how to make it

00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:13,329
easy for email users to use GV GE I

00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:16,660
think there are two problems you have to

00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:19,780
generate your own key player but that

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:23,740
can be somehow automated maybe with good

00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:29,800
defaults and the other keys distributing

00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:32,589
keys the idea was to just add something

00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:35,170
to the signature into the email all the

00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:38,650
time basically like on your visitors car

00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:42,480
and maybe use it you are like format

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:45,609
until you say it's open G TV stand up

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,420
the mail addresses dis gone and the PID

00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:49,609
of the gpg key

00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:52,670
that one homo so the software i could go

00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:54,589
to Lisa a fetch two key then you have to

00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:57,440
talk with you that you so you can use it

00:37:54,589 --> 00:38:01,490
to encrypt stuff to him and add it to

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,799
your local key ring somehow cost of the

00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:06,170
problem with this is this there is no

00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:08,510
trust in this system cause it could be

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:10,700
all fake but the best thing that could

00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:13,670
happen is you could encrypt something to

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:15,890
that guy using a wrong he and he could

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,450
not read it yes and that should be

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,940
detectable and basically the other guy

00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:25,069
will get back to you are just be very

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:27,530
irritated only ammonia man-in-the-middle

00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:29,420
attack maybe is a problem with that is

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,690
but it would be better than everything

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:34,910
in plain text like now exactly and if

00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:38,030
you remember the key IDs and you can

00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:41,270
stall them locally somehow you can maybe

00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:49,010
find out if something suddenly changes

00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:50,630
yes yes and once you have it and then

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,369
you use it again and again and again and

00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,390
then it changes suddenly you basically

00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:58,549
notice it and somehow if someone wants

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:02,240
to get in the middle you would somehow

00:38:58,549 --> 00:39:04,549
have to know when you do it or be always

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,980
watching in always being yes and you

00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:08,660
need to basically intercept that even if

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:10,880
I mean it will be accessing the server

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,069
or I'm at home and so on so you need to

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,250
be quite powerful to always intercept

00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:18,200
this and constantly because you only

00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:20,540
need to not do it once and then suddenly

00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,520
become strange you know if you're

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,049
quicker than the whole soil I did any of

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,540
everybody actually get the idea of what

00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:32,180
the idea of this this little thing here

00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:34,369
is the idea is that you distribute your

00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:38,240
public key information the basic public

00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:39,500
key reference with every male just in

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,559
the signature but in a machine-readable

00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,950
format so that email clients like matt

00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:49,210
or thunderbird can fool little plugin

00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:53,660
parse out this information so that they

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:58,220
can correlate the mail address with the

00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,600
public gpg key information and just

00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,910
throw a plot locally

00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:04,280
which means when I when Thomas sends me

00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,170
a mail and I don't have his public he

00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,450
currently I don't know no clue by

00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:12,350
security sent me a mail my med client

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:14,660
realizes the this line and stores it and

00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:16,700
later on I want to send a mail so I'm a

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:20,420
trans oh I know this looks it up because

00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:22,340
it has the key ID and encrypted and it's

00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,500
completely transparent it only guards

00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:27,920
against passive attacks at that point

00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,290
because if somebody was sitting in

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,860
between and basically faking the keys to

00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:36,350
both sides he could basically cheat us

00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:39,320
but it guards very well against passive

00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:41,390
attacks already so you would fetch the e

00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,760
at the moment you r I didn't know to me

00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:46,160
that's kind of the big fellow that

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,410
immediately I don't know but I actually

00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,270
think is I mean I wouldn't mind if that

00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:54,910
format also had the possibility to

00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:58,310
actually have a full URL here because

00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:00,320
yes just some I mean if I had for

00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,360
example if I I mean it's an example of a

00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:13,030
signature would be justified it in here

00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:13,030
I mean it could be it could be something

00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:21,580
yeah that's a question why one of the

00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:21,580
head i actually will head up and never

00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:29,720
ex- pgp and you need to be used it

00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,200
because everyone can have some sort of

00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,780
signature well you use

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:36,359
put your name and it worked in case than

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:40,910
whatever there's light not the special

00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:44,369
headless needs more software changes yes

00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:48,510
yes that's I think good idea I mean the

00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:50,730
idea to one thing more I mean what I

00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,859
would like to have is to basically also

00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,480
be able to somehow specify them so the

00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:56,910
form it should be a lot maybe slightly

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,470
more generic fair I want to be say i

00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:28,950
want to say basically you can get the

00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:30,960
key here yes but you should google yes

00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:34,710
my Harrisburg sure I'm no no sure sure

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,460
sure sure try how do when you go mad and

00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,460
Gigi

00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:45,030
I think yeah that name

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:59,960
then my head up yep here yeah this is

00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:05,900
right that doesn't work to use it you

00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:10,010
should use my underscore HDR and then

00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:13,550
space and stay popping sign and then you

00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:16,580
put the header without words so this is

00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:20,680
an established stand up that way I don't

00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:25,040
think so but this is the way I added it

00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,810
yes yes so that would be interesting to

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,550
check if there's actually something of a

00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:39,530
convention at least even without a

00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:42,740
standard yes I mean a URL is also nice

00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:45,560
because it could I mean if you have the

00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:48,920
key ID I guess there's a canonical way

00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:57,730
to specify a URL that goes to the PGP

00:43:48,920 --> 00:44:00,730
service right are they called hkp

00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,730
something

00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:17,220
the question is if I can find some show

00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,840
no I mean I have a URL basically here

00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:23,700
where I can just you know point to it

00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:25,680
directly I mean that should be possible

00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:34,260
i hope because we should be able to get

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:37,340
the URL actually a bit longer yes yes

00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:41,610
it's rather long for your advice without

00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:45,020
encoding sorry better way it's actually

00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:45,020
bigger when you have it

00:44:52,710 --> 00:45:00,330
the URL is the most better if your self

00:44:55,589 --> 00:45:06,510
post in the stock you can say p JD mau

00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:12,300
and search equals key ID yes Adam equal

00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:18,960
sign so check that good Mike in the air

00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:26,520
and then something like this oops what's

00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:36,930
yr now sometimes yeah yes so basically

00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:39,410
yes I mean this should be basically

00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:42,210
converted to the github page i would say

00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,589
and you did you send a mail to that's

00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,050
the most important maybe did you send a

00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:48,390
mail here we just need to send one male

00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:56,010
and then you get you need to confirm and

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:57,390
then you're basically getting nails yes

00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:05,760
the first is going to be dropped

00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:07,260
basically yeah see you later okay isn't

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:10,710
that but we have a continuous session no

00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:12,240
sorry I thought we had I mean a I mean

00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,270
for me it's actually also fine we don't

00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,550
need recording we can just continue a

00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:21,810
bit like this so you don't need rated

00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:27,510
spring just bring it back and that is

00:46:21,810 --> 00:46:28,910
now yeah there's no way with biasing

00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,160
that either

00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:37,170
the key could verify fingerprints off it

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,940
shouldn't be the short leash yes I think

00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,410
it should probably be I mean it can it

00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,060
shouldn't be the full key but at least

00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:47,099
enough that it really is kind of you

00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:48,599
know right but that's something I mean

00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:51,690
that should be defined and I think the

00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:54,570
challenge here is to find something and

00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:57,450
maybe talk to like you know some much

00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:58,830
gpg people and so on because it should

00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,589
be something like a convention that is

00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,359
used eventually also from Thunderbird

00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:06,900
anak mail and so on so you can actually

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:09,240
easily configure your stuff to have that

00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:12,210
so that it becomes very convenient for

00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,070
many people what I what I find important

00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:18,240
about the idea to also have it in the

00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:21,060
header is that this way the the mail the

00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,890
MTA the mail transport agent if you're

00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:25,830
running this yourself like post fix or

00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:31,859
something actually also can read these

00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:33,270
these this information yes know what we

00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:37,410
needed to do the mail it's encrypted you

00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:39,810
won't see it the MTA cannot see what is

00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:43,020
in the mail you know it can only look at

00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:44,280
the Harris as far as I understand the

00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,760
headers are not going to be encrypted

00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,760
right

00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:54,109
I don't think they had a sign cribbage

00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:55,339
usually active usually if you get a male

00:47:54,109 --> 00:47:57,529
you're basically get the mail and then

00:47:55,339 --> 00:48:00,770
you have a mime thing that basically

00:47:57,529 --> 00:48:04,130
encrypts that part and that means the

00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:05,990
headers are not encrypted and that means

00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:10,000
that the MTA can actually see that

00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:10,000
public key and it could also store it

00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:19,579
yes yes exactly an HTTPS is different

00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:21,349
because you make the Megan ssl

00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:23,119
connection and only then do you tell

00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:33,470
about the path and do all the method I

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:36,950
was like yes if it's inside the mail

00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:38,390
yeah no no but no no you only get an

00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,010
encrypted mail and you're supposed to

00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:41,510
decrypt it I mean you are supposed to

00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:45,049
actually be able to decrypt it and then

00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:49,000
you see it yeah I mean not you see it

00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:49,000
but your email client actually yeah

00:48:52,510 --> 00:49:01,010
mainly for setting up yes but also I

00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:03,020
mean it should I mean an email client a

00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:06,920
plug-in actually that reach this it

00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:09,619
should continuously read em these these

00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,480
keys that are provided and even brick I

00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:12,950
think and even record the number of

00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,180
times that had already seen it and it's

00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:18,200
interesting to know that for the past

00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:20,539
year you know the kia spectra simpson

00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,000
transmitted like this forever and now

00:49:20,539 --> 00:49:25,309
it's suddenly changing and i can give a

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,200
much more interesting message like oh

00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:29,690
this will has been used for one year and

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,220
twenty several conversations now it's

00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:33,220
suddenly a different key yeah

00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:41,539
Meyer yeah okay I mean then you have to

00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:43,160
reset up yes I mean if you ask the key

00:49:41,539 --> 00:49:47,450
expires it could basically send a mail

00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:48,859
with the new key already yeah maybe yes

00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:51,559
I mean there's many things but I mean

00:49:48,859 --> 00:49:55,940
these setups we need to stop them all

00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:58,609
right yeah okay I mean this but I like I

00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:01,009
said I mean maybe that's just I'm going

00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:05,109
to be a viet the pie party thing and I'm

00:50:01,009 --> 00:50:06,979
happy to continue some discussions there

00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:09,609
but I think this is a very concrete

00:50:06,979 --> 00:50:13,579
thing to actually go for to have a nice

00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:17,269
email setup that is not so that helps

00:50:13,579 --> 00:50:19,219
against passive attacks basically and

00:50:17,269 --> 00:50:21,440
it's not really i think it's still kind

00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:23,630
of convenient the drip the people are

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,489
always very nervous when something gets

00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:28,700
convenient but i don't really get the

00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:31,249
point here because that's Carrie better

00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:34,759
than you should some sort of is great

00:50:31,249 --> 00:50:41,390
yeah sure it's only again massive attack

00:50:34,759 --> 00:50:43,160
i hope there now yes yes i mean the

00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:51,380
things that you still have the

00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:53,180
possibility to do something basically do

00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,779
something out of band I mean you can

00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:55,779
