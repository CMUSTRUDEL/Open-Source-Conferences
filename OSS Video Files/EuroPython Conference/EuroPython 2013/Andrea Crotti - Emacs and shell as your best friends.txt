	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,519
ah yes well that was not in me I think

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:20,119
it was I will yeah I didn't even touch

00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:22,490
it now it's five you're right my phone

00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:27,359
okay

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:29,429
so I'll explain you what I would like to

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,309
do with this over space which I think

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:34,380
might be interesting if you are able to

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:38,040
all clone well first of all you need all

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:45,809
Emacs installed and possibly Emacs 24 at

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:48,840
least 23 I don't know because a problem

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,370
is the package installer which is we I

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,870
mean if you're able to install all these

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,059
packages by yourself or you already have

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:59,579
them and that is not a problem but yeah

00:00:56,059 --> 00:01:01,590
so then this is the thing you have to

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:04,110
clone and then the only other thing you

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,900
need to do is install to Python packages

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:16,740
you can install them on your user or do

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:17,909
sudo pip blah blah blah I yeah so let me

00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,659
know if you have problems with that and

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:25,619
then I can stop so what I will do is to

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:28,860
show how we can make a very simple like

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,229
100 like 107 lines configuration which

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,490
does more or less everything you need to

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,020
do well

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,119
not everything but most of the things

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,030
that people ask for when they want to

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,210
write Python code such as

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,380
snippets autocompletion show you the

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,820
list of things which I would like to

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:51,210
show snippets djd for the auto

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,689
completion pilant warnings and errors in

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,640
the buffer how to compile things to run

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,250
things run tests for sample maggot for

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,950
gate integration how the customization

00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,509
works with the package installer and

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,759
then also the last one is fine file

00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,110
repository which is quite nice allows

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,090
you to automatically use the git git LS

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,380
files and find files in a repository

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,310
with a simple keystroke as we show them

00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,970
so if everyone

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,560
so first of all that just how I don't

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,569
really know what is the level of Emacs

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,319
knowledge I can't I can't start from

00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:31,030
scratch sadly but I will just try to

00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,610
explain a few basic things which might

00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:37,630
be useful okay just some basic

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:42,030
terminology at least but here I'm using

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:45,480
awesome which is window managers so it's

00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:49,900
so these are to actually separate

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,690
windows but in Emacs terminology is a

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,780
bit different because a window is here

00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:57,940
is like a Emacs entity so these two are

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,500
two different windows even if are in the

00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:04,120
same in the same window manager window

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,340
then we have a buffer which is the thing

00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,730
where you write text and the buffer can

00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:11,200
be associated with a file or not so it's

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,150
not necessary if I do like at the

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,070
scratch buffer which were where things

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,359
are open normally you don't see any it's

00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,739
not associated with any file and it

00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:25,959
starts normally with with asterisk then

00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:30,430
what you have then you have a frame a

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,530
frame is the window in the standard

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,450
window manager sense you can have

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,850
multiple frames for the same instance of

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:40,420
image I can make another one now I can

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:42,040
kill in killing now is and then the

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,930
other thing do you all get did you all

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,180
get this URL no maybe another thing

00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:53,049
which I will do now which might be

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:55,090
interesting there is this nice this nice

00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,930
extension which will show all the keys

00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,519
are we I'm pressing so then if I go here

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,889
for example it will show us which frame

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,120
ago here control a and then it will tell

00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,459
you also which function has been

00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:10,540
executed so then you can see I'm not

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:14,230
cheating or doing any stage show keys

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:16,729
not else and showing key to lesson

00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:21,260
now it's right to the body from my

00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:22,669
github but because I didn't include it

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,199
in the configuration because I only I

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:26,199
need this I think so

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,690
right so I start from the beginning

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:42,070
yes well except for this thing but yeah

00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,949
let me see

00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,660
well I can show you first

00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:53,960
I'm not sure if I should show you first

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,060
okay I show I go in order I'll uncomment

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,539
everything start again Emacs so you see

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:03,080
that I do one thing at a time and we

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:07,630
don't get confused right so I quit the

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,630
mix it's something you should never do I

00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:16,370
go again project talks EP blah blah

00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:24,560
Emacs then I open the init file

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:25,970
oh no this here you need I will remove a

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,510
few things so there's more space

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,520
available

00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:34,510
I removed menu bar mode I remove tool

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:39,710
bar mode then what else scroll bar mode

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:44,570
mode smoothly then I make a new frame so

00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:51,580
I have two two frames then I load the

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:51,580
file show keys and I enable it here

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,280
and then so far I'm still having with

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,419
the default configuration I did a max

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,729
minus Q which doesn't load any init file

00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:09,070
right so let me uncomment everything

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:11,020
just to make sure first of all I used

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:13,770
the package installer which is something

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,270
nice that was added in a in Emacs 24th

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,460
if I press ctrl e come truly you will

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:23,100
evaluate each line so first of all I

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:28,990
require it then I initialize oops I

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:31,360
initialize I do initialize it and then I

00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:34,139
add a couple of repositories for extra

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,060
extra packages because I want to see

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,190
things that are not in the standard one

00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:42,070
but then I and then I do package of

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:44,320
fresh content which will if internet

00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:49,120
works we contact the valid host here

00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:51,610
yeah it worked and then here there is a

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,840
function which I evaluate and then I

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,090
have a list of stations which I would

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,570
like you to to use because I think

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,580
they're useful

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,820
so the respite or mode which is a

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:05,530
different mode and the default one just

00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,750
a seem more powerful and more and I said

00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,590
that is Magid which is for maggot eat

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,200
integration

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,780
yes snippet for snippet like in textmate

00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,840
JD for auto completion and so on

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,039
autocomplete useful with JD to get the

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,240
actual auto completion

00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:23,860
auto pair to close bracket and then find

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,349
finally repository which I show you

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,849
later with us so now I have all these

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:30,099
things I have this function install if

00:07:27,849 --> 00:07:32,470
needed will install the package only if

00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:34,419
it's not there so it will check it

00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,930
checks unless the package is already

00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:40,510
installed install it simply and then I

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:42,789
use a Mopsy pass the name of the

00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:45,070
function and the list is like a math

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,900
winner in Python basically so I do this

00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,320
what variable to install because I

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:52,210
didn't evaluate this I do this blah blah

00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,470
and didn't do anything because I already

00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,630
stole them because I didn't trust the

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,910
network so I stole it before but if you

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,340
do that you will download everything and

00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:04,910
compile compile and put them in a place

00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:08,450
which is basically dot MX dot

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,760
the LPA and then here the all the

00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,280
packages if you have any questions or

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:19,100
you have troubles installing and doing

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,320
things than me this now I use a well

00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,870
it's similar but I mean this is actually

00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,750
the standard way now to do it so there

00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:29,120
have been many different ways but then

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,880
they finally found and the only thing

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,830
what the good thing is that you just add

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,060
these two packages actually to lead to

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,969
see all the packages you have available

00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:41,630
and do list packages and then it will

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:43,070
contact the various hosts and then will

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,600
show you the list and then you can

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:46,640
install which one you want very easily I

00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,540
click here I say install and it's

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,620
installed so nice and simple alright

00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:56,900
first thing I will add think is maggot

00:08:53,620 --> 00:09:02,090
so i uncomment this then i evaluate

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:05,050
evaluate evaluate and now I stole maggot

00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:08,120
and then I also set a global set key

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,730
control equal call this function maggot

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,620
status so I do control XD and then you

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:16,130
ask me if I want to save a file yes and

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:19,880
now I am in the maggot this is like the

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:22,900
maggot entry entry point here you can do

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:26,150
all the cool things so I can click with

00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:29,440
tab and see the diff of the file I can

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,330
we do with P and N and go to the various

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,610
different parts of the deep then I can

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:39,590
see if I press I press L it goes it

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,540
shows me a long list of things we did is

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:43,130
the log get maggot lock and then I press

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,320
elegant I said the list of all the

00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,920
commits for example then I go with N and

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:52,310
I see for each commit like the diff I

00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:53,480
can do I can do maggot and I don't even

00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,550
remember all the things but if I do

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,980
maggot check out and it tells me to

00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,010
switch to and then I switch to a branch

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,500
which you can do basically anything you

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:05,630
can rebase you can you can do everything

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,700
from this simple interface and there is

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,100
also a branch manager which is quite

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,030
nice which allows you to create remote

00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:17,170
check out different branches remote

00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,170
remove remote branches and so on

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:30,879
if better now okay so then I will

00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:33,579
require a few more how I do evil region

00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,759
instead a few more extensions which I

00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:39,670
already stole and then we and this and

00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:41,290
this also fine finally repository which

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:45,249
maybe I'm not sure that requires

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:48,879
actually yeah fine finally repository I

00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:51,610
bind it to f7 because this how I do it

00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:54,100
but you can bind to anything you can so

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,470
the nice thing is that I press f7 now

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,569
and then it will tell me fine file in

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,309
repository and you will actually call

00:10:58,569 --> 00:11:02,350
like get less files and then give me a

00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:05,139
list of other things like in the actual

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:09,670
repository what I mean so I jump this

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:13,379
one then I go back okay here there are

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:13,379
some settings for autocomplete

00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:20,300
if you're not you cannot come very

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:23,630
familiar with the Li Elizabeth set Q is

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:28,250
simply like a setting a global variable

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:29,840
Elise is basically a dynamic scope sadly

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:31,970
well it's like a glow there are all

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,480
global variables but all the names all

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:39,710
the things unless you do let lets you do

00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:43,420
other things by default then we go to

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:47,030
the interesting part which is the Python

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,160
the pythons ethics first of all I have

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:53,230
already PI too modest all but it doesn't

00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:56,900
know now if I open a Python file right

00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,220
so if I do X dot pi you will use it the

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:03,410
default Python Python thing I can see it

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,410
because I know that that is fightin in

00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:09,440
this mod line so if I do this instead

00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,410
you will for each file which is called

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,660
ends with dot pi will use this new PI to

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:18,130
mode which I stole this out of mode the

00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:19,700
list is simply an association between

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:22,040
extension which of a regular expression

00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,310
and the mode that you should open it you

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,430
can see that it's basically this long

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:31,070
thing with all the possible modes and

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,920
extensions are solved then I just set a

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:38,060
few more variables and then this is the

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:42,350
more interesting part is that when every

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:45,590
mode normally has a variable with a -

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:48,950
hook in the end and this variable is a

00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,490
list of list of things which will get

00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:55,550
executed when the mode is enabled so for

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,670
example now if I evaluate this and then

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,190
I evaluate this this hook we get had

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:03,500
added to the part to them to a Python

00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:06,950
mode hook and then if I create a new

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,260
heard a new file new PI and now as you

00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:13,960
can see below I have yes which is yes

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,960
lipid and pair both enabled

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,210
it's just wait

00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:26,210
I just know which one it is because

00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:35,400
right I can do major mode for example

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:39,810
and it shows me Python mode otherwise it

00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:43,890
should be just by Tania's if I do yeah

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:46,260
if I know actually I think I'm still

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,210
using the old one I know sorry sorry

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,980
sorry I'm still using the old one

00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:54,320
because I didn't do a require Python

00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,320
mode sorry right

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,220
I forgot to do that now if I do it again

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:03,490
I do a reverse buffer you should become

00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:07,030
pie-ya l became pie a pie to modest pie

00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:11,020
in in this mod line and but if you do

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:12,700
like if we do this you see control HF

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,350
and then the name of the function you

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,600
see where the where this function is

00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,600
defined from is like say Pi 2 model yet

00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:25,240
right so as to go quickly actually so

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,180
then the next interesting part is JD

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:34,960
which is this library which you need to

00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:37,210
install this JD package and and this is

00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:38,460
what actually now I have to set us

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:43,020
something else

00:14:38,460 --> 00:15:00,010
because I have to force Python - sadly

00:14:43,020 --> 00:15:01,270
machine ok so now I said JD and now the

00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,210
other thing which I need to do is to

00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:07,630
actually set the hook of other hook also

00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:11,110
for JD so when I when I enabled fighter

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:13,060
mode it will enable here JD setup and

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,610
then we will do a cease attack which is

00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:18,520
for auto completion and then you will i

00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:19,450
just set some other key bindings for me

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,690
because i like them

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:27,130
basically right so now i enable this

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:30,550
hook now i go again to complete may be

00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:33,940
complete by and if everything went fine

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,670
I should have auto complete yes as you

00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,980
can see I already see this import and

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,720
then if I wait for some time it shows me

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,480
where it comes from and it shows me the

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,620
dock string so now I do import less if I

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,650
do OS and then I do s it will show me a

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:53,590
list of thing and I do this I just like

00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:56,680
this I do control D he shows me the dock

00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:59,080
string of this thing if I call it it

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:02,670
should also yes suggest me what is the

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:07,690
input that I have to pass to this thing

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:08,529
if I'm using Python modules like I

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:17,009
should have

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:21,339
called library' yes so I do from from

00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:25,050
library import function yet and then I

00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:28,300
can do I can go to this and I could alt

00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:33,519
dot and it will jump will jump to that I

00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:36,610
think there is still text to to JD so

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,559
this is actually what JD does does help

00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:41,910
to completion it jumps to the definition

00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,910
it shows the document as well

00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:50,350
but I think Jade is much better

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,360
well I think Rob the problem is pi max

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,139
as always being a big clunky I don't

00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,420
know I know

00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,279
and usually much faster I think it's

00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,910
very I think it's very very good it's

00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,910
very good libraries

00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:08,350
then the other thing is fly make which

00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:12,579
allows you to have inline errors of from

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:15,539
pilot in the buffer so this is a bit

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:19,839
tricky to explain everything but

00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:21,429
so this basically just says this I also

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,929
copied somewhere I mean it's somewhere

00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:26,589
later I don't even remember what it has

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:29,259
but so he has to set like a temporary

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:32,080
file where it does all the all the

00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:33,759
parsing and all the the iran's pylons on

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,389
this temporary file and then it gives

00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:39,039
back this the result of the error or

00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:41,799
checking to the original file and it

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,659
shows in the buffer then I have

00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:46,059
something smarter here which is fly make

00:17:43,659 --> 00:17:50,649
activate which simply activate fly make

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:53,139
but then in plus also check if the if is

00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:55,720
the real file if there is a buffer file

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:58,869
name so it means that the file is not

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,759
just the buffer is not just not attached

00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:02,590
to any file so there is a file name and

00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,960
then you also check that the file is

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:08,470
actually writable because otherwise I

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,179
can't create this temporary file and

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,549
then a couple of bindings which are

00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:16,119
useful so well I evaluate this evaluate

00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:19,659
this this is again something nice to get

00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:24,009
some more interactive help and then I

00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:27,369
say post command hook well then I say

00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:30,809
that I want to enable this fly make

00:18:27,369 --> 00:18:34,210
Python in it for the files and with PI I

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:36,369
value this and then to the Python mode

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:40,539
hook I add fly make activate and

00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:41,259
autocomplete mode also so I go back to

00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:45,730
this file now

00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:48,090
I do revert buffer which also reload the

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,619
hooks when I because here a lost them

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:53,249
void function fly make Python in it

00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:53,249
because I forgot

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:03,690
again yep I work now I see I fly me here

00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,780
and it tells me I have zero arrows and

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:10,050
actually now I have one warning and it

00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:13,890
tells me unused import function so now I

00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:16,560
do function and it appears if I have

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:21,360
like a syntax error here this I'm fine

00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,700
by the way if I have another area then I

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,470
press control and it will jump me to the

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,870
previous error control and previous

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,050
error control P actually I should have

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:34,470
said well I can make it jump to the to

00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:36,810
the arrows I can when I fix them and it

00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:40,020
just disappear so this this in the

00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:42,030
background runs EEP Island in my real

00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:43,320
configuration I make you run also pipe

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,240
eight and something else and then

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,150
combine all these results and show me

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:53,550
something even right so I is already

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:59,400
good enough right then I lost well

00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:01,320
Phyllis then I also enable either mode

00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,640
which is very nice as you can see at the

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,890
moment from the moment I enable you the

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,740
mode I already have this nice way to

00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,870
switch between buffers and same thing

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,260
when I press control it control F to

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,990
jump between files this is also this is

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,870
something from the standard library from

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,050
the standard image distillation is -

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:24,900
then a few other things which are just

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:27,840
this is to jump between Windows without

00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,270
do a control Excel but just doing shift

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,700
as you see I do shift right shift left

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,980
which is same as controlling so Patra

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,110
but this works also going up and down

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:41,670
not just otherwise with controlling so

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:43,890
you have to do the whole circular ok

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,900
then I show you how you create how we

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:49,500
can create a snippet because I am shown

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:53,310
that I think so suppose you don't want

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,140
to always define things right type

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,020
everything which I don't want normally I

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:02,880
have yes enable here and then I want to

00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:06,450
say that I do I do this combination ctrl

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,810
X and ctrl n or yes new snippet and then

00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,810
I say

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:20,090
this remove if you think and then I say

00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:22,100
function arguments and then I go here so

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,350
this is basically somehow the same

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,380
syntax that was in textmate and I think

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,780
also other programs has similar thing

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,690
this means when I do it with with it

00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:36,650
with a curly bracket with a curly

00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:38,420
bracket then I can pass it will jump to

00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:40,250
this thing and the order of when it

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,110
jumped to things well I show you how it

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,290
works because I can't pay so I do

00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:47,210
control C control C now ask me for which

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:50,120
mode I want to save it as a Python mode

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,610
saved to a new file yes and then save it

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,660
to the file function it was saved in my

00:21:52,610 --> 00:22:00,170
DX directory now I type func wait fun

00:21:56,660 --> 00:22:02,270
and here is so here it gives me X but I

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:06,290
can override it and then it jumps to the

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:11,600
to the zero another another cool thing

00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:17,710
that you can do for example is is with

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,710
mirroring I can define something with

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:33,460
and then I can reuse the same value

00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:38,120
again simply that this just saying again

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,650
now I save this link press Mir and now

00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,290
if I change this also the other one

00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:49,100
changes and then it goes again to the to

00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:52,160
the last place so I think that's more or

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:57,380
less all I want to show me let me see if

00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:00,980
I forgot anything how to complete fly

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:02,690
make Maggie customize yeah well and yeah

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,230
another thing which is nice is that you

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,690
can customize all these packages easily

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,670
now actually in Emacs because you can

00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,070
say customize group and then I say for

00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:17,120
sample maggot and here I get an

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:19,900
interface where I see all the way option

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,370
that I can set what is the default value

00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:23,990
docs training for that it tells you what

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,920
to do and you can change it you can save

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,690
it also somewhere so that's so yeah it's

00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,910
not true it's also true anymore that

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:39,470
Emacs is difficult I think just takes a

00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:40,910
few years and then you're right ok well

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,890
I think I think I'll leave time for

00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:45,740
questions all try to help someone if you

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:48,260
someone managed to to I would like

00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:51,200
someone to actually manage to to to

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,430
configure it and yeah I thought I think

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,750
you're ants for everyone because I try

00:23:52,430 --> 00:24:02,669
with the new user known anything

00:23:53,750 --> 00:24:14,409
installed but yeah questions problems

00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:19,080
yes I can show you again and then wait I

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:19,080
will also tweet that here probably

00:24:22,570 --> 00:25:08,550
any questions on least body max or

00:24:25,440 --> 00:25:12,460
anything here if I want to simplify

00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:13,630
defining new classes yeah you can use a

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:17,140
snippet for that

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:22,410
yes leap the thing I was showing before

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,410
like to do this no wait

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:27,700
but now I have conflicting things okay

00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:29,980
this thing now you can just create the

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:33,820
snippet with a class definition and some

00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:37,630
methods and then in like a template and

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,130
then we with this kind of syntax one and

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:42,490
you can do actually you can do anything

00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:44,320
you want you can even have Lisp inside

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:46,450
this snippet so you can actually

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,510
evaluate some code there and do crazy

00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:52,510
things if you really want to yeah but

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:57,690
unfortunately we have finished time so

00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:57,690
if you can go also outsider

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:04,690
yeah but time is finished really we need

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,320
to switch through each room sorry you

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,320
can find me

00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:20,480
