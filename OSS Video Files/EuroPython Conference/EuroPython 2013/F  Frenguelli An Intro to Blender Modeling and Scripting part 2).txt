thank you so uh you have the table model

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:30,539
you model the table last time we see now

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:37,140
the next the next exercise is oh I was

00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:42,420
on the next exercise no okay modifieds I

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:46,320
don't know if you remember what modifier

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,020
are and these are automatic operation

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,530
that can modify your mesh in a

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:58,949
non-destructive way so let's see how to

00:00:52,530 --> 00:01:05,189
use modifiers during modeling so open up

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:13,170
blender and reload the startup the

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:16,350
startup file and you can find modifiers

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:31,729
here on the properties editor on the

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:34,530
bottom right yes is this button and wait

00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:40,619
suppose we see that we select you have

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:45,689
the cube selected and active and I can

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:50,820
show you for instance the RA modifiers

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:53,939
and what the array does is to copy the

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,950
object multiple times along one of the

00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:02,579
axis and for example yeah we can

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:07,250
increase the offset you can increase the

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:12,420
number of copies you can also add

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:19,420
another array modifiers

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:23,200
are organized as a stock so you can put

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:27,940
multiple modifiers on the stack and just

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:38,349
for example here we add an offset on the

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:42,819
y-axis 1.5 and here is a matrix of cubes

00:02:38,349 --> 00:02:48,370
it is not the most interesting thing you

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:55,299
you can do with modifiers 10 one of the

00:02:48,370 --> 00:03:02,200
most interesting stuff is let's add just

00:02:55,299 --> 00:03:05,549
delete the default cube and add the

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:11,739
monkey Suzanne the mine the monkey head

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:18,030
and let's add subdivision surface

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:22,389
modifier and this one actually

00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:32,109
subdivides each of the faces of the mesh

00:03:22,389 --> 00:03:36,489
and if you activate edit mode as I told

00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:40,090
you it actually modifies your mesh

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:42,940
without distracting the original shape

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,329
the original geometry so in when you are

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:52,980
in edit mode you can interact with the

00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:58,359
original mesh and the modifier creates a

00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:01,169
virtual geometry so but you can you you

00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:07,859
can still interact with the original

00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:11,530
vertices edges and faces and a

00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:15,040
subdivision surface is really really

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,459
useful because if you have to model a

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,940
complex object like the battle we model

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,940
it before

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:28,400
wait when you model the battle you keep

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:34,180
the number of Earth vertices use it very

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:41,690
low then you use the subdivision surface

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:45,050
to to smooth the mesh to to give the

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:50,750
mesh and smoother appearance and so

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:56,660
let's try to use subdivision surface

00:04:50,750 --> 00:05:15,760
modifier on our previous model so open

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:21,800
open up the battle blend file yes and as

00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:31,930
you can see it is really it is not very

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:41,419
nice so we can add a subdivision surface

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:43,550
and butter looks really better here you

00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:48,550
can increase the number of subdivisions

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:56,510
and now we can increase subdivisions to

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:58,479
fight you can increase the these numbers

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:07,580
to give the battle a smoother appearance

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:11,270
and as I told you if you go into edit

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:17,620
mode you can still interact with the

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,620
original vertices so

00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:42,330
I wait for you sorry now no excavate

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,969
this is that the modify creates a

00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,569
virtual geometry okay but you can still

00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:52,939
interact with the with the vertices of

00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:58,020
the original mesh fine then you if you

00:06:52,939 --> 00:07:01,439
look at the modifier settings there is a

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:04,349
apply button and if you apply the

00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:08,969
modifier the virtual geometry becomes

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:10,879
the true geometry of the mesh but we

00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:23,779
don't want that we don't want to do that

00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:23,779
now I can repeat the steps if you want

00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:48,509
okay so open up the bustle file and you

00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:52,199
can you can find modifier settings

00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:56,159
modify its properties on the properties

00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:00,180
editor here on the right is the the

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:05,699
button with the icon of branch how is it

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:09,839
causing a branch yeah okay and here you

00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:16,469
can add modifiers to the current active

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:19,159
object on the scene okay I wait for you

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:19,159
okay

00:08:50,050 --> 00:09:04,209
it's okay and uh I can continue okay

00:08:54,269 --> 00:09:07,209
fine so where is my mouse oh oh okay and

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:11,110
here you can add the modifier there are

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:13,260
a lot of modifiers we I really can't go

00:09:11,110 --> 00:09:16,810
through through all the modifiers but

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:22,660
you can you can easily play with them at

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:26,140
home and to to to refine our mesh or

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:31,149
battle we need the subdivision surface

00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:38,920
modifier this one actually subdivides

00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:42,220
the faces of a mesh so the mesh has a

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:48,010
smoother appearance we can increase the

00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:53,670
number of subdivisions here set it up to

00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:57,339
three fine and when you use a

00:09:53,670 --> 00:10:01,420
subdivision modifier you usually want to

00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:05,230
control the edges of the mesh cause

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:09,779
maybe just for example at the end of the

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:13,300
neck of the battle you don't want a

00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:19,570
smoother appearance here for example so

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:25,360
how to control that behavior you can go

00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:33,370
into edit mode and add a look at here

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:38,770
then bring down loop cut here and do the

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:43,570
same thing just here you need to add

00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:48,180
some vertices around need Lucas also

00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:48,180
wrong here fine and

00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:58,730
that that is how you can control hedges

00:10:55,670 --> 00:11:06,670
when you are using subdivision surface

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:10,550
modifier and I want to do the same also

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:13,100
if you need remember to take a look at

00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:17,269
the reference image always look at the

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,170
reference image while modeling most

00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:27,680
important when you are modeling details

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:31,040
reference image is very important and I

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:45,130
think we need to add an edge loop at the

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:45,130
bottom so right here much better

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,350
yes

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:06,880
also you can you can notice that our

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:09,160
battle has no thickness so we need to

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,850
add some thickness to the puddle how to

00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:19,350
do that there's a modifier of course and

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:19,350
we can add a solidify modifier

00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:33,800
which adds some thickness to the active

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:41,530
object just stop me if you get stuck

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:46,190
okay we are here we can increase the

00:12:41,530 --> 00:13:02,600
thickness maybe 20 point one is it's too

00:12:46,190 --> 00:13:07,400
much maybe 0.05 yeah yeah oh um one to

00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:12,740
deactivate 12 by bypass subdivision

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:23,000
surface cuz I think solidify should come

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:28,790
first yeah I usually apply solidify

00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:36,160
because I need if you apply it it will

00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:40,040
create the geometry inside the bottle so

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,190
just add solidify on top of the stack

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,060
you can control the position with these

00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:51,710
arrows add the solidify on top on the

00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:55,120
stack and apply it okay of course

00:13:51,710 --> 00:14:02,390
modifies cannot be applied in edit mode

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:05,390
yes so now if you you can yeah display

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:09,500
modify a real time you can be passed

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:15,430
modified if you click the I and as you

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:21,700
can see now we have we can control the

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:30,220
energy ama tree of the bottle and so

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:30,220
let's add a look at here also

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:41,900
to fix the border of the of the bottle

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,900
and one here

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:49,830
really nice

00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:08,620
tell me if you want to me to repeat the

00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:14,410
steps again yeah okay fine so I start

00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:20,590
from the beginning so that was my my

00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:25,420
bottle i'm going to add yeah this time

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:37,560
I'm going to add the solidify first just

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:42,370
add it set the thickness to 0.05 no no

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:45,010
no I'm not in Europe you have to select

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:52,600
the button the battle must be the

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:59,100
current of the active object and you

00:15:52,600 --> 00:16:07,210
have to do this in object mode okay so

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:11,770
yeah okay so switch to the modifiers

00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:17,700
properties panel here in the properties

00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:17,700
editor window type as one

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:43,750
no no it's not the end okay and it's

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:53,420
different and open up Oh show you okay

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:59,000
okay okay yeah in the the switch the

00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:01,640
button with the branch is this one oh no

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:18,190
did not the same yeah this one object

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:18,190
modifiers fine solidify its the yeah

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:36,010
so solidify here you can control the

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:41,289
thickness and many others settings bar

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:46,809
we we only need thickness today set the

00:17:41,289 --> 00:17:51,450
thickness to 0.05 and then apply your

00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:58,360
modify so that you have real mashed data

00:17:51,450 --> 00:18:03,630
inside now you can add your subdivision

00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,630
surface modifier to the mesh

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:27,820
the add thickness okay i go back here

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:31,649
you set it to 0.05 okay and then you

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:42,759
apply it and when you apply it it

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:47,970
becomes real through geometry ok then

00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,970
add the so solidify modifiers

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:07,399
sorry no this will be fine at the

00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:11,960
subdivision surface and set the number

00:19:07,399 --> 00:19:15,860
of subdivisions to to go into edit mode

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:22,360
as i told you to control the better

00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:22,360
control edges you are too hard loop cuts

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:41,140
yes this is needed to control the edge

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:41,140
crease so thanks to look at

00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:06,910
on the top of the neck add 1 loop cut on

00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:11,370
the on the outer part of the bottle and

00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,370
one loop cut on the inner part

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:52,850
tab oh I'm going to activate again the

00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:52,850
screencast he is display so you can see

00:20:53,299 --> 00:21:12,260
you can switch between edit mode and

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:12,260
object mode with tub let me see oops

00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:27,679
okay I think you

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:41,470
yes it is so you see edit mode object

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:46,310
mode you're you're the mouse pointer

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:50,000
must stay inside the 3d view if you

00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:52,010
press tab first up here it won't work ok

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,230
it's work when your mouse pointer is

00:21:52,010 --> 00:22:12,830
inside the 3d view and just apply the

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:17,360
solidify and anybody needs help no

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:36,680
feedback oh yeah you need help oh ok

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:51,040
fine it is fine it's ok fine control our

00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:51,040
yes yeah up here yes you have to your

00:22:51,370 --> 00:23:00,320
but you enter or left mouse click to

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:06,880
confirm fine it is it's better if you

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:06,880
activate a wireframe mode if you press z

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:15,840
just let me go into AB the object mode

00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:40,029
plus it's gone again yes fine object

00:23:29,169 --> 00:24:03,250
mode fine press Z ok it seems there are

00:23:40,029 --> 00:24:06,490
a to a lot of okay yes oh maybe you can

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:09,760
also oh yeah there are a lot of vertices

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:13,480
too much loops but you can also reload

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,649
the battle fight the battle blondfire as

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,649
you wish as you wish

00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:27,910
to select in the loop yes services to

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:31,010
get to looking selected roti season I

00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:36,380
wanted to leave they let me those ones

00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:44,380
yeah you can select them with B and you

00:24:36,380 --> 00:25:07,640
can draw rectangular selection yes wait

00:24:44,380 --> 00:25:12,320
okay which one yes but I I think can I

00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:17,560
say where is that ok you want to move

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:21,380
them up you can select the loop weed out

00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:25,970
pressing alt right mouse click on the

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:30,830
edge that is part of the loop yeah the

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:36,800
edge this part of the loop so yeah ok

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:39,670
the loop is broken you can have my black

00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,670
file if you want

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,690
yes

00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:07,290
I think anyway try to render your battle

00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:12,090
now it looks much better also we can

00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:17,280
change the the shedding of your mesh if

00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:19,710
you look at your toolbar here is shading

00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:27,780
parameter you can switch between flat

00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:32,450
and smooth shading just choose smooth to

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,450
give the object a smoother appearance

00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,200
and

00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:50,330
as I said you control you can control

00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:56,000
the Mensch crease the edge crease adding

00:26:50,330 --> 00:27:10,759
loop cut and moving the loop cut towards

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:13,059
the border that you want to breathe not

00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,059
so bad

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:43,320
no okay yes of course you have to apply

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:48,390
I forgot you have to be in object mode

00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:52,549
to change the smooth awe of your mesh to

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:58,350
change the shading of of your mesh yes

00:27:52,549 --> 00:28:20,280
that is flat shading and smooth shading

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:27,330
ah what yes yes yes of course yes I can

00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:29,330
show you now i'm going to zoom you don't

00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:38,270
have to do that just to show you

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:38,270
difference if you render

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:56,420
and flat with a flat shading she

00:28:52,429 --> 00:29:01,860
shedding as the process of assigning a

00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:07,440
color to the surface of your mesh it is

00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:13,620
based on the angle between the light and

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:18,030
the does your face so when you use flat

00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:21,390
shading you assign the color looking at

00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:28,820
the angle between the light the right

00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:36,210
direction and normal of the suface in

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:42,809
when you use I go back to smash when you

00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:47,160
use smooth shading the the color of the

00:29:42,809 --> 00:29:53,940
mesh smoothly change across the surface

00:29:47,160 --> 00:30:05,370
of the mesh is it clear yes fine yes it

00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:12,270
was and are you okay did you end up with

00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:18,750
this button fine so these are modified

00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:21,870
and they are a little bit advanced stuff

00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:23,580
in blender but I wanted to show you how

00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:28,340
to use because they are really really

00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:28,340
really useful and as I told you the

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,800
array is one of the most used

00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:40,740
subdivision surface of quartz and there

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:42,929
are some other if you if you want to

00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,300
continue use blender I strongly suggest

00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,220
you to go online I look for video

00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:50,550
tutorials and then you can see many many

00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:56,690
examples about to use how to

00:30:50,550 --> 00:31:00,080
proficiently use modifiers but it's

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,830
this topic is maybe too much for for the

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:08,720
training so let's go to the next step

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:12,710
just save your model and let's go back

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,140
to the slides yes that was the

00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:21,650
interactive exercise refining the battle

00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:24,740
and I did I want to ask you model a

00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:27,620
glass you have a reference image inside

00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:30,320
the resource folder and I don't know

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,630
there is anybody everybody has the

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:39,430
resources you have the recruits is no

00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:39,430
okay and if you go into exist

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:04,090
exercises for the five you have this

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:07,240
reference image you can model the glass

00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:11,640
using the skills you acquired in the

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:16,570
first part of the training and use the

00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:20,620
subdivision surface modifier to refine

00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:24,760
the glass and also remember you need to

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:28,330
add thickness to the glass so solidify

00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:31,150
it first and then as we did for the for

00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:38,170
the bottle solidified first and then add

00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:47,370
the subdivision surface five minutes to

00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:47,370
do that now in joking just joking

00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:37,210
I show you how to set maybe you don't

00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:39,940
remember the background image and I save

00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:45,940
the bottle and they start with new file

00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:50,200
and you press n oh wait I can activate

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:55,810
the screencast display let's say you

00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:59,850
press n so it wish and you see the

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:03,930
properties panel and here you have

00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:07,480
background images section opening

00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:20,220
activate check the checkbox add an image

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:25,570
and you can open the reference image 1

00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:35,010
plus and now the reference image will

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:35,010
show on autographic view front view and

00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:43,260
this is the starting point for your

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,260
glass

00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:16,140
okay the training will end at seven

00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:18,359
o'clock not half past seven because

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:23,460
there is the presentation of sprints at

00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:29,280
seven o'clock so we have one hour and I

00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:33,180
want to ask you uh no I think we we are

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,780
enough time to see some Python scripting

00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:45,930
in blender and also physics simulation

00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:49,230
engine which is really really cool so as

00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:58,260
your is the glass ready you have the

00:36:49,230 --> 00:37:10,050
glass you have the glass yes fine fine

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:14,930
fine okay shitty ah uganda a primary a

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,930
tornado siren Americo when I visit us in

00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:41,749
fashioned glass our nice nice I don't

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:43,969
think you can use it it's really

00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:54,229
difficult to drink from the with this

00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:59,589
glass in oxygen and I want I got a hint

00:38:54,229 --> 00:39:02,589
for you if you don't remember how to

00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:05,829
translate rotate if you don't remember

00:39:02,589 --> 00:39:08,749
transformations you can find

00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:11,079
transformation on the properties on the

00:39:08,749 --> 00:39:15,079
toolbar which is the panel on the left

00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:19,460
as you can see you have transformed

00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:24,859
translate rotate scale and if you hover

00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:31,960
over the button for a while a the

00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:31,960
tooltip we tell you the shortcut key

00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:59,320
so i can start modeling the glass fine

00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:15,680
so many of you completed to cut the

00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:17,890
glass raise your hand oh nice really

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,890
nice

00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:31,780
it's good yeah now remember you have to

00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:36,840
apply modifiers and solidify to add

00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:45,910
thickness you have to be in object mode

00:40:36,840 --> 00:41:02,920
yeah and you can find yeah does anybody

00:40:45,910 --> 00:41:11,080
need some help I love it love it yes you

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:17,370
you have a whole yeah there is a hole in

00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:21,000
your glass of course but yes you need to

00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,000
close this hole

00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:49,320
you can add faces to the left part of

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:55,590
the man yeah yes yes is a it's a

00:41:49,320 --> 00:42:07,920
solution yes then that's another

00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:13,470
solution that will work too of course so

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:16,880
we can you first the solidify and it is

00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:20,720
better because it is absurd if you

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,450
subserve first it will apply some

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,210
subsurface and then solidify but you

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:30,630
want to solidify it first so you have so

00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:33,690
the subdivision surface is aware of the

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:39,530
geometry added by the solid solidify

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:39,530
modifier ok fine

00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:50,150
and I'm at the point where

00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:57,200
and I'm i saw with a little

00:42:50,150 --> 00:43:00,099
yeah oh you oh well okay you this is the

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:05,480
thickness parameter okay you can

00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:09,260
increase it as you wish point one yes of

00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:13,069
course and check your match to see how

00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:15,020
solidify effect on the mesh if you want

00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:25,660
to check the mess you can also switch

00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:25,660
back to solid mode just a bit but

00:43:37,999 --> 00:43:47,569
right it's okay it's okay fine now you

00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:56,919
can apply the modify and then you use

00:43:47,569 --> 00:44:07,549
the subdivision surface modifier okay si

you are discovering short cut yourself

00:46:47,400 --> 00:47:11,460

00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:11,460
with the British shape of your match so

00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:25,560
can you can you go on to a wireframe

00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:25,560
mode and first exam fine now zoom out

00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:36,849
not again yes ok if you have any

00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:39,700
modifiers already active no fine that's

00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:45,750
ok so one yarn back with this kind of

00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:51,930
mess just the lead the part is giving

00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:55,480
problem so I I suggest you go into

00:47:51,930 --> 00:48:05,079
vertices select mode you can switch with

00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:07,480
controltalk but first um ok vertices ok

00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:12,220
fine now the select all the vertices

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:20,140
with a move and now produced be to

00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:24,030
select not the one fine ok press x to

00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:24,030
the let vertices

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:36,480
it depends on one on what you want to

00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:42,510
delete if you want to delete all in the

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:48,780
face and leave the vertices you have to

00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:51,990
choose faces for example or but in this

00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:55,020
case if we delete vertices the vertices

00:48:51,990 --> 00:49:03,120
you selected it will also delete the

00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:07,410
edges that are part of yes of course

00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:12,860
that was fine and now you can select

00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:15,860
that clue and extrude again from loop

00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,860
okay

00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:25,030
the rest on

00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:39,789
ah yes of course it's next is the next

00:49:35,749 --> 00:49:39,789
step materials

00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:57,280
your heart your heart yeah if you if you

00:49:52,570 --> 00:50:12,090
add too many subdivision and you order

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:15,400
maybe can handle that okay ah ah ah

00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:19,980
Selita to tow a deciliter to tupelo

00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:29,110
residential india sierra tierra mia e

00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:31,710
deselection otouto oto you're fat

00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,710
perfetto

00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:45,810
ok

00:50:49,080 --> 00:51:02,790
I'm going to model the glass cause so I

00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:08,940
start from a circle of course and move

00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:12,450
it down here scale it up and then go

00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,730
into edit mode Oh too many vertices yes

00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:19,440
I don't like to use too many vertices I

00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:28,740
want low poly mesh so add the circle

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:36,080
again Oh God add the circle the first

00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:42,770
time I set the number of vertices to 12

00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:46,890
which is nice move it down skeletal go

00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:57,510
scale it up a little bit and you go into

00:51:46,890 --> 00:52:05,880
edit mode extrude get it down exclude

00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:09,080
again get it down X through again need

00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,080
why frame mode

00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:15,369
scare it off rear beat man

00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,790
ok we can add a loop cut here

00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,930
is it correctly

00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:14,410
yeah I will add another loop cut here

00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:22,809
yes and ass glass as I said you now you

00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:29,460
need to add to solidify the glass and as

00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:43,059
you said before there is and all here

00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:45,160
okay so yes really fast yeah how to

00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:48,579
handle that because if you if you add

00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:53,859
solidify now the whole is still there

00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:59,950
it's just you don't hear it anymore yes

00:53:53,859 --> 00:54:04,299
buddy okay but it is not the the proper

00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:08,049
way to handle the whole okay because you

00:54:04,299 --> 00:54:13,979
don't want vertices when you apply

00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:13,979
solidify it creates vertices inside the

00:54:15,569 --> 00:54:26,130
how do you call it the handle of the

00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:37,749
glass yeah you don't want vertices edges

00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:43,619
here so you you can select this loop cut

00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:49,170
and add am fill it with a face using f

00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:59,200
this is one of the possible approaches

00:54:49,170 --> 00:55:04,089
or you can or you can model the inner

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:08,109
surfaces of the glass yourself and I I

00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:13,349
prefer this this kind of approach so

00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:16,730
this time it is really really important

00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:20,540
to work in wireframe mode

00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:25,090
of course and you start from the border

00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:25,090
of the glass just select the loop

00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:36,590
extrude right mouse button to cancel

00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:40,220
trust for now scale it down okay look at

00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:45,320
mesh we are manually adding thickness to

00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:51,320
the to the glass then extrude again and

00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:58,310
go down to the bottom here then scale it

00:55:51,320 --> 00:56:03,170
down fine I'm too fast I'm going too

00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:10,840
fast okay it's okay and then you add

00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:10,840
loop cut to the inner geometry just Oh

00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:26,809
ok

00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:42,240
of course you have to close this one and

00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:45,450
you can add face here using F or as we

00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:49,830
did for the battle using merge so you

00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:57,260
extrude to create the vertices to merge

00:56:49,830 --> 00:56:57,260
and then I'll em to merge at center and

00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,800
you can take

00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:22,690
and we also need to close the bottom of

00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:27,860
the class use the same technique extrude

00:57:22,690 --> 00:57:33,790
scale it down extra gain at em to merge

00:57:27,860 --> 00:57:33,790
at center as we did for the the bottle

00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:45,320
do I need do you need I mean you want me

00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:50,510
to repeat the step I started with the

00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:53,840
circle yes what I just gonna go this one

00:57:50,510 --> 00:58:00,350
yeah okay yeah down there and then you

00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:03,260
scale s yes it's okay it's okay scaling

00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:06,200
down but i suggest you to always work

00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:11,930
with the background reference image so

00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:15,830
go into front orthographic view wait one

00:58:11,930 --> 00:58:21,080
yes yes but you to work you don't have

00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:31,580
to be on transform yes okay now scale it

00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:36,530
oh you scale down the whole object yeah

00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:42,380
ok so anyway look at reference image you

00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:48,500
can it is not important to just just use

00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:55,540
the reference image to understand what

00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:55,540
you should scale the loop okay

00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:07,699
edit mode again a scaling down

00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:26,960
people

00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:35,720
and since the bottom of the glass it it

00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:40,930
is not perfectly flat we go into we are

00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:47,680
going to move this loop cut and this

00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:47,680
vertex here a little bit up

00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,280
oh god what happened

01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,480
ok

01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:20,520
we are all glass now you don't need

01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:27,210
solidify anymore just add a subdivision

01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:33,089
surface suggests you to set the number

01:00:27,210 --> 01:00:35,510
of sub sub division 2 30 this one is the

01:00:33,089 --> 01:00:38,849
number of subdivision that will be used

01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:41,490
for rendering and this one is the number

01:00:38,849 --> 01:00:49,530
of subdivision that it is currently

01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:53,450
using to preview the object yeah it's

01:00:49,530 --> 01:01:01,950
finally that it used on the 3d viewport

01:00:53,450 --> 01:01:05,819
fine and try to render the glass yes

01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:16,970
it's me of course also activate smooth

01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:16,970
shading and object mode s pretty nice

01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,240
make this you know thing wider but if

01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:34,010
they not to say control oh I always get

01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:37,310
the outer points zoom in yeah okay and

01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:37,310
control are

01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:47,770
yeah now it is you have to hover over

01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:54,150
with mouse in all over one of the inner

01:01:47,770 --> 01:02:04,440
edges like okay move slightly left

01:01:54,150 --> 01:02:04,440
slightly here is the inner click it yeah

01:02:06,730 --> 01:02:09,930
so it's very thick

01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:15,310
and I have to

01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:30,800
yeah I suggested to go into solid mode

01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:35,420
silent mode hi to you and needed

01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:40,579
vertices I need to notify no solid more

01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:44,260
visually with that yes oh you're on the

01:02:40,579 --> 01:02:44,260
wrong side yeah

01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:59,490
just select the yes now with me because

01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:03,869
if you use me you're going to select all

01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:07,380
vertices inside with the loop selection

01:03:03,869 --> 01:03:13,619
alt right mouse button take but first I

01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:16,109
select everything with a yes all right

01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:17,819
mouse button and you have to click on

01:03:16,109 --> 01:03:24,380
one of the edges that is part of the

01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:30,079
loop I is the outer circle the big one

01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:36,450
yes the edges that is part of the circle

01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:42,140
yes fine now extrude to create e to

01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:47,880
extrude press right mouse button to

01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:50,190
concern the transfer or escape fine now

01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:54,329
extruded vertices are in place and you

01:03:50,190 --> 01:04:05,210
you can use it them to merge with our

01:03:54,329 --> 01:04:05,210
alt Em Aunt Em fine at center yes and

01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:13,010
yes are you are you

01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:29,260
ha ha llamado wanna see okay alejandra

01:04:25,690 --> 01:04:33,610
pregunta cuando tu in problem Anita

01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:38,830
castle a que una Gorra es are in d.c

01:04:33,610 --> 01:04:40,960
well control re la la la la lo little

01:04:38,830 --> 01:04:44,220
star turned on the windy agent ando de

01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,220
loup cottage in John Doe

01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:38,050
thank you as you can see the bottom of

01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:41,730
the glass it's not really perfect and

01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:52,900
that's because as I told you when

01:05:41,730 --> 01:05:57,940
subdivision surface is working here it

01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:59,830
is it's subdividing the faces of that

01:05:57,940 --> 01:06:06,340
match so to control the crease of the

01:05:59,830 --> 01:06:11,430
edges we need to add a loop cart if you

01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:11,430
are the look at here and scale it up

01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:28,510
you end up with a nice glass bottle

01:06:36,180 --> 01:06:50,739
yes it's with this rice is ok now you

01:06:45,579 --> 01:06:54,009
can observe it you can close the bottom

01:06:50,739 --> 01:07:01,749
of the glass you have to add face there

01:06:54,009 --> 01:07:13,200
and then apply the modifiers yeah you

01:07:01,749 --> 01:07:16,930
select the loop extrude and merge alt

01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:21,789
alt cut right mouse button to select a

01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:24,940
loop no no you have to select not not

01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:33,009
the loop cut to see a loop selection so

01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:35,470
yeah II need two extra yeah because you

01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:38,200
need to create the vertices tomorrow Jam

01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:41,039
now escape but because you are if you

01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:48,029
move your mouse you can see you are oh

01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:48,029
yes fine too many things you do now

01:07:48,450 --> 01:07:53,880
modeling is really hard at the beginning

01:07:51,009 --> 01:07:53,880
but if you

01:07:55,290 --> 01:08:09,240
cheap glass is dirty yeah I it it's okay

01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:17,650
that's new year yeah you you can or

01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:24,220
remember to go on remember to switch

01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:26,200
into object mode and apply smooth

01:08:24,220 --> 01:08:34,750
shading you already have smooth shading

01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:39,430
apply it and a subdivision surface on

01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:45,819
you modify yeah as the second-last on

01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:49,359
generate category I fine here it is much

01:08:45,819 --> 01:08:54,160
better it and increase the level the

01:08:49,359 --> 01:09:00,509
subdivisions 23 this one and also the

01:08:54,160 --> 01:09:09,100
render number of fine much better okay

01:09:00,509 --> 01:09:14,710
and and you can also control the edge

01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:20,730
crease as I as I show you as I shown you

01:09:14,710 --> 01:09:29,799
before we love cars there's another way

01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:40,650
you can select a loop and we shift shift

01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:40,650
e to control edge crease yeah that was

01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:56,440
I show you here instead of adding loop

01:09:48,430 --> 01:10:07,830
cards you can select this loop press

01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:07,830
shift T and to increase the crease and

01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:22,010
you have proper geometry yeah

01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:37,090
yes it's a kind of way yeah if you want

01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,940
to use if you want want to modify edge

01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:47,070
crease you can add loop cuts to the

01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:54,970
geometry and move or scale look at near

01:10:47,070 --> 01:10:56,950
the other near the edges okay this

01:10:54,970 --> 01:11:01,660
allows you to better lead to better

01:10:56,950 --> 01:11:11,260
control how solidify our subdivision

01:11:01,660 --> 01:11:16,860
surface modifier your mesh fine yes it

01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:21,810
still to be to fit in the camera so just

01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:32,650
just scale it down and grab it movie

01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:38,460
here yes fine and maybe you need to to

01:11:32,650 --> 01:11:44,280
set up the lamp as I'll show you before

01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:48,460
go to the properties panel lamp switch

01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:51,370
to Sun lamp and set the strength to

01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:57,310
three like in the first part of the

01:11:51,370 --> 01:12:02,320
training session and now you have more

01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:11,440
light like see

01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:15,340
oh the lamp zoom out you select here is

01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:18,550
the lamp the right mouse to select the

01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:25,659
lamp and now this is the second last on

01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:33,909
the properties but I find now select

01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:37,349
sunlamp not point but Sun and set the

01:12:33,909 --> 01:12:37,349
strength to three

01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,810
yes

01:13:00,919 --> 01:13:10,909
yeah in any food you don't have this

01:13:04,019 --> 01:13:21,889
kind of time yeah it you have to slap

01:13:10,909 --> 01:13:36,169
you so you are yeah that's allowed okay

01:13:21,889 --> 01:13:36,169
you got it fine did you manage it

01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:51,809
yes talking around oh yeah you use known

01:13:47,429 --> 01:14:05,329
click on use node and set the strength

01:13:51,809 --> 01:14:05,329
to 3.0 3.0 oh my back to me

01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:46,219
hello okay the mic was turned off we can

01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:49,429
go through materials or see take a look

01:17:46,219 --> 01:17:59,300
at some Python scripts and what do you

01:17:49,429 --> 01:18:01,340
prefer yeah of course yeah okay let's

01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:06,400
make the glass let's say the material to

01:18:01,340 --> 01:18:11,150
the glass fine so select the object to

01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:17,900
manage materials you go to the

01:18:11,150 --> 01:18:25,179
properties panel and click on this kind

01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:30,139
of sphere now you can add materials and

01:18:25,179 --> 01:18:35,469
to add a new material click on you this

01:18:30,139 --> 01:18:41,480
is ah the fold material here you have

01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:46,270
our preview so you can change the type

01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:50,630
of material switching this surface

01:18:46,270 --> 01:18:55,099
parameter you have a lot of these are

01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:59,530
called shader and for the glass we are

01:18:55,099 --> 01:19:07,040
going to use the glass shader of course

01:18:59,530 --> 01:19:12,469
so select the glass shader and this is

01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:15,489
the preview we can also change the car

01:19:12,469 --> 01:19:28,460
for example I will set it slightly

01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:36,679
slightly green finish and then just

01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:40,880
change name green glass fine now if you

01:19:36,679 --> 01:19:43,940
go to render again yeah you can see the

01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:47,590
material is in place but we're going to

01:19:43,940 --> 01:19:47,590
add a plane

01:19:54,200 --> 01:20:07,260
so let's go to two front orthographic

01:20:01,470 --> 01:20:11,400
view and we can we can also deactivate

01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:20,700
the background image because there is no

01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:25,110
more necessary just move your glass here

01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:29,340
you know the origin and let's let's

01:20:25,110 --> 01:20:35,730
let's add a plane as a base for the

01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:41,340
glass fine now try to render again just

01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:47,010
to see ya we need to fix the camera

01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:53,640
position so select look at the select

01:20:47,010 --> 01:21:04,020
your camera and use 09 / 02 go into the

01:20:53,640 --> 01:21:11,880
camera then press G and movie so the

01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:20,160
glass is at the center of the camera now

01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:29,490
render again yeah it's nice yeah glass

01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:32,790
is it's really realistic yes there is as

01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:38,580
you can see there is a bit of noise and

01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:41,150
that's because Cycles render rendering

01:21:38,580 --> 01:21:41,150
engine

01:21:49,860 --> 01:22:00,429
is it improves your image sub so you

01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:07,199
have to increase the number of samples

01:22:00,429 --> 01:22:07,199
that the number of passes I don't know

01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:14,800
the number yeah the number of samples it

01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:20,110
will use for each pixel to increase

01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:25,440
their you can go to the render

01:22:20,110 --> 01:22:32,320
properties panel which is the first one

01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:40,179
scroll down to the sampling section open

01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:52,480
it and set rent render samples to 100

01:22:40,179 --> 01:22:58,510
for example reason now rerender but the

01:22:52,480 --> 01:23:01,570
rendering will be much much slower so if

01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:05,860
you want higher quality rendering you

01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:10,119
have to increase the samples but it will

01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:11,590
be it will take more time of course it

01:23:10,119 --> 01:23:14,650
is not the only parameter you can

01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:23,849
control there are a lot of parameters

01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:23,849
but oh but it now it looks nice yes

01:23:30,330 --> 01:23:44,199
okay yes the first button is the

01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:50,620
properties the camera yes fine if you

01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:54,400
scroll down to samples sampling ok now

01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:58,540
you can change the number of samples

01:23:54,400 --> 01:24:04,840
used to run rich picture for example set

01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:17,620
it to 100 just click at the center of

01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:30,550
the slider yeah fine rerender it is much

01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:37,330
more slower because for you own your

01:24:30,550 --> 01:24:41,160
green is too dark I think you have to

01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:41,160
use a lighter three

01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:57,280
yes go to do fine yeah exactly but move

01:24:57,489 --> 01:25:18,309
Chico near the white yes fine much

01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:35,000
better okay we have 15 minutes what you

01:25:18,309 --> 01:25:43,909
squeaked paddles quick yeah yeah let me

01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:50,420
see oh so you can save your work oh you

01:25:43,909 --> 01:25:55,639
can after you r and read your model you

01:25:50,420 --> 01:26:00,139
can save it using the image menu here

01:25:55,639 --> 01:26:11,320
save as image and you can say that one

01:26:00,139 --> 01:26:11,320
as a PNG if you want anyway I just got

01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:23,480
going to save this file plus save you

01:26:19,599 --> 01:26:29,000
let's reload the startup file and switch

01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:37,070
back Yes Mother cheer our this your

01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:40,699
homework okay texturing is really cool

01:26:37,070 --> 01:26:48,320
but we have no time to see how to add

01:26:40,699 --> 01:26:52,760
texture to your model yeah here we are

01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:59,150
so python blender of course uses Python

01:26:52,760 --> 01:27:00,300
and what is it used for a lot of things

01:26:59,150 --> 01:27:03,420
you

01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:09,119
even write a new rendering engine in

01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:14,670
Python but i think that the only reality

01:27:09,119 --> 01:27:18,119
you can do in with python is automating

01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:23,040
boring tasks and extending blender with

01:27:18,119 --> 01:27:27,290
add-ons and so how it works blender

01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:32,219
embeds Python interpreter and which is

01:27:27,290 --> 01:27:34,290
started when blender we just started

01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:38,400
with blender and stays active all the

01:27:34,290 --> 01:27:43,679
time and the Python version that plan to

01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:45,780
use this is a 3.3 and yes they always up

01:27:43,679 --> 01:27:50,520
to date with the latest version of

01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:53,400
Python and all the tools we need to

01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:58,460
develop our scripts are inside blender

01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:58,460
so let's see the two

01:28:03,610 --> 01:28:16,480
uh-huh fine you have I will oh no I like

01:28:11,170 --> 01:28:20,739
it I'm going to split this window just

01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:23,949
to show you we have we have a fight on

01:28:20,739 --> 01:28:31,449
console I don't think that doesn't need

01:28:23,949 --> 01:28:40,300
explanation and we also oh no we also

01:28:31,449 --> 01:28:43,929
have a text editor yes we in this is not

01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:49,750
very powerful this is not a Python

01:28:43,929 --> 01:28:55,260
editor it's just text editor but if you

01:28:49,750 --> 01:29:00,310
want you can use next your your best

01:28:55,260 --> 01:29:06,159
external editor to write your your

01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:14,980
script and yeah for larger project of

01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:20,770
course so i suggest you to start blender

01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:25,210
from the comment line cause you

01:29:20,770 --> 01:29:29,409
absolutely want to see the output of

01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:31,800
print statement because there is no

01:29:29,409 --> 01:29:35,350
support there are no debugging tools

01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:38,520
when here when you work when you when

01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:42,580
you write script in blender so if you

01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:48,820
run it from the comment line you can see

01:29:42,580 --> 01:29:53,610
the output of print statement yeah okay

01:29:48,820 --> 01:29:53,610
so let's go

01:29:55,540 --> 01:30:14,270
mmm back to blunder fine you we instead

01:30:11,420 --> 01:30:17,120
of setting up the user interface

01:30:14,270 --> 01:30:21,530
manually by splitting windows you can

01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:28,720
also use pre-configured layout and you

01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:35,720
can switch to the scripting layout using

01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:39,110
this drop-down menu and just choose

01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:46,840
scripting and you have to all the tools

01:30:39,110 --> 01:30:53,150
you need so let's see the hello world

01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:56,810
let's add a new text blender provides

01:30:53,150 --> 01:31:03,500
the BP BP y module to the Python

01:30:56,810 --> 01:31:06,860
interpreter that is the door to the

01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:09,800
blender word and this module can be as

01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:16,460
the first thing you have to import in

01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:23,350
your in your script what right okay fine

01:31:16,460 --> 01:31:34,300
in it is already imported in the console

01:31:23,350 --> 01:31:34,300
yes and so that's right

01:31:43,440 --> 01:31:56,300
yes and to run it just click on run

01:31:49,260 --> 01:32:03,660
script here or alt p and run script and

01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:08,870
you see the message or the cone so hello

01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:14,219
world from land o fine but let's do

01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:16,830
something more cool and in blender every

01:32:14,219 --> 01:32:22,260
settings that you can change with a

01:32:16,830 --> 01:32:28,860
button can be changed using it can be

01:32:22,260 --> 01:32:33,840
changed through Python so let's say if

01:32:28,860 --> 01:32:38,270
one what to do if we want to add a cube

01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:45,650
for example to the scene using Python

01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:50,000
first of all where where what look just

01:32:45,650 --> 01:32:54,810
press shift AE to open the add menu and

01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:59,460
hover over cube for a while and you can

01:32:54,810 --> 01:33:02,420
see the tooltip here as Python VPI does

01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:08,040
ops dot mesh dot primitive cube odd

01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:12,600
let's try to type this function in the

01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:17,730
interpreter but first just delete the

01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:20,760
cube so in the interpreter b py dot ops

01:33:17,730 --> 01:33:24,770
dot mash you can you also have

01:33:20,760 --> 01:33:29,719
autocomplete we control space ok mash

01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:29,719
premiere a cube

01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:50,440
odd yes and that's it the cube fine so I

01:33:41,699 --> 01:33:56,020
think if you want if you want the cumin

01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:58,960
tation I show you shift a cue press with

01:33:56,020 --> 01:34:03,570
your right mouse button and you can

01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:13,300
click on online python reference and

01:34:03,570 --> 01:34:15,550
this will open a page on your browser it

01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:17,409
will bring you to the documentation to

01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:26,440
the align documentation for that

01:34:17,409 --> 01:34:30,239
function show you again shift a imagine

01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:34,600
you won the documentation for this call

01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:39,280
just right click on it and click on

01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:43,690
online patent reference but you can do

01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:47,050
the same let's say for example if you

01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:51,250
want to translate the cube if you / /

01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:55,900
translate you can see BPI ops v py dot

01:34:51,250 --> 01:35:00,280
apps that transform dot translate right

01:34:55,900 --> 01:35:04,630
click pi to reference and you can see

01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:06,850
all the options values to you can use to

01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:11,500
translate the object I wait we have five

01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:16,679
minutes left so let's see a very very

01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:26,550
simple script that was an exercise but

01:35:16,679 --> 01:35:26,550
we have a few few minutes remain now Oh

01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:39,000
Python yes let's see cubemetricks which

01:35:34,449 --> 01:35:39,000
is to be scraped bar

01:35:41,110 --> 01:35:53,690
lastly and run script and this will

01:35:46,039 --> 01:35:58,820
create a cube matrix which is really

01:35:53,690 --> 01:36:04,489
cool and before before we go to the

01:35:58,820 --> 01:36:11,750
spring presentation so the mouse the

01:36:04,489 --> 01:36:20,269
mouse the mouse I want to show you very

01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:24,139
nice script yes this is Anna done how to

01:36:20,269 --> 01:36:25,849
write an ad on in blender is a Python

01:36:24,139 --> 01:36:29,239
script you need to define this

01:36:25,849 --> 01:36:42,440
dictionary and blender will use this

01:36:29,239 --> 01:36:47,269
name and catagory to the name here and

01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:50,329
the category I don't remember yes there

01:36:47,269 --> 01:36:53,949
are metadata that going to use is in the

01:36:50,329 --> 01:36:53,949
the down list and

01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:17,100
and here for example i have defined it a

01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:20,820
very a new menu you extend from one of

01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:25,800
the basic types the many types you add

01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:31,290
the ID this is just a convention so the

01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:37,560
an object when you type will begin with

01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:41,100
object go am a string of your choice

01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:44,730
this is the level the draw function is

01:37:41,100 --> 01:37:49,050
called when blender ones draw the menu

01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:54,410
and here we add operators you can refer

01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:58,260
operators using their ID and all

01:37:54,410 --> 01:38:01,470
operators operators I these are

01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:04,740
documented inside you can find the ideas

01:38:01,470 --> 01:38:08,970
inside the blender documentation then H

01:38:04,740 --> 01:38:16,650
ad on as to-read itself and the class

01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:19,950
that uses and for example in I have to

01:38:16,650 --> 01:38:23,100
reduce the class of the menu and then I

01:38:19,950 --> 01:38:30,050
tell blender ok add the menu to the

01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:39,960
header of the 3d viewport so if now I

01:38:30,050 --> 01:38:44,390
run oh god the mouse yes if I run this

01:38:39,960 --> 01:38:44,390
script here

01:38:47,540 --> 01:39:02,720
you can see that we have a minus on the

01:38:52,550 --> 01:39:10,010
header of the of the 3d 3d view 3d

01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:15,320
viewport yes but you can also install a

01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:22,790
down here install from file that is

01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:29,180
perfectly correct too yes i can start

01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:34,040
this done then yes you look for your

01:39:29,180 --> 01:39:37,490
Python add-on and just activate it to

01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:40,100
have your renewal your new menu here and

01:39:37,490 --> 01:39:42,530
that way you can really you can easily

01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:49,130
extend the blender user interface you

01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:53,270
can create menus new operators new

01:39:49,130 --> 01:39:58,220
panels of course to handle properties

01:39:53,270 --> 01:40:09,980
and stuff like that and yeah I think

01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:19,900
that's all yes yes yeah it is it is

01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:19,900
possible you can you can I just show you

01:40:25,410 --> 01:40:38,790

01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:41,850
uppercase B yes to run the the given

01:40:38,790 --> 01:40:44,550
script and you this will run the script

01:40:41,850 --> 01:40:46,860
okay I have to stop yeah just one thing

01:40:44,550 --> 01:40:49,440
I this will run the script and then

01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:53,100
start blender but it if you want to run

01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:55,460
the script and but you don't want to use

01:40:53,100 --> 01:41:00,210
the blender user interface you can also

01:40:55,460 --> 01:41:04,560
run the script and add this option i

01:41:00,210 --> 01:41:07,830
think there is minus minus background it

01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:14,190
will run the script without showing you

01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:16,340
