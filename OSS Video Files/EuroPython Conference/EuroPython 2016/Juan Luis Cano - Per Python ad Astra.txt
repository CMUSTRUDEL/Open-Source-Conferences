	Juan Luis Cano - Per Python ad Astra
[EuroPython 2016]
[20 July 2016]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

In the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and "cool stuff that
travels through space" lies Astrodynamics, a beautiful branch of
physics that studies the motion of spacecraft. In this talk we will
describe poliastro, a pure Python library we can use to compute
orbital maneuvers, plot trajectories and much more. The role of JIT
compiling (using numba) to drop the previously used FORTRAN algorithms
will also be discussed, as well as the importance of open source in
scientific discoveries.

In the intersection of mechanics, mathematics and "cool stuff that
travels through space" lies Astrodynamics, a beautiful branch of
physics that studies the motion of spacecraft. Rocket launches have
never been so popular thanks to companies like Space X, more and more
investors pay attention to aerospace startups and amazing missions
explore our planet and our Solar System every day. In this talk we
will describe poliastro, a pure Python library we can use to compute
orbital maneuvers, plot trajectories and much more. The role of JIT
compiling (using numba) to drop the previously used FORTRAN algorithms
will also be discussed, as well as the importance of open source in
scientific discoveries.
