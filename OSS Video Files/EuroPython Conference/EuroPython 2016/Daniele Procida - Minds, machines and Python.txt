Are we looking in the wrong direction for artificial intelligence and
machine learning?

I'll discuss an older but perhaps more satisfying approach, that has
been neglected in recent years.

It begins with questions in logic and language, and can be explored
using easy techniques. I'll use simple Python programs to explore
three key notions in this AI research: **loops**, **self-reference**
and **tangled hierarchies**, themselves directly reflected in
important programming concepts.

-----

In recent years, we've seen interesting and spectacular successes in
artificial intelligence and machine learning, made possible by leaps
in computing power and techniques able to harvest vast quantities of
data.

The results are uncanny. We see them everywhere, from the personal
assistants built into smartphones to the neural networks that do an
astounding job of recognising images. However, they're also
susceptible to the criticism that they represent not intelligence but
a mere simulation of it, and that producing a convincing simulacrum
has become more important than a genuine search for  intelligence or
learning.

At the same time, another, perhaps deeper, approach has become
neglected in recent decades, along with the questions it asks about
the nature of mind, intelligence and learning. This approach begins
with fundamental questions in logic and language, and can be explored
using some of the simplest programming techniques.

In this talk, I'll use simple Python programs to explore three key
notions in this strand of artificial intelligence research: *loops*,
*self-reference* and *tangled hierarchies*. The way these concepts
directly reflect important concepts in programming suggests that for
the programmer, this approach could be more interesting and
satisfying, and simply more **fun,** than using huge ontologies and
big data to create mere simulacra of intelligence.

The examples I use will be concrete and easy to understand, even for
novice programmers.

and thank you very much i'll quickly

00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:12,059
introduce myself and i'm daniela

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,799
property there that's me and my favorite

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:19,880
portrait of me as you can see it says i

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:26,779
am python software and yeah thank you

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:32,669
and i work at dvo a swiss django company

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:35,910
and I'm a developer of Django CMS and

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:37,380
I'm a core developer of the Django

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,320
project and a member of the Django

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,870
software foundation board and you can

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,239
find me in the usual places online on as

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,309
evil Dimpy on IRC and github on twitter

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,079
and there's my email address there so

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:54,270
feel free to contact me about anything

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:56,579
so firstly thank you and thank you for

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,760
inviting me to be here for being here to

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:02,219
listen to me speak and thank you

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,750
especially to the organizers and

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:04,890
volunteers of this conference because if

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,010
you're enjoying yourself here it's

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,780
because of them it's a I know how much

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,159
work it is to run a conference and to

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,840
run a conference of one and a half

00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,150
thousand or so people is a pretty big

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,890
deal things will go wrong if things go

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,840
wrong it's not because they didn't care

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,600
or didn't think it's just because stuff

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,180
happens so if you see any of the

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,590
volunteers or organizers just say to

00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,270
them personally oh thanks by the way I'm

00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,680
in during the conference because I can

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,430
tell you as somebody who has done this

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,979
that actually it means a great deal and

00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,540
so thank you to those people who are

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,130
making this yes yeah thank you little

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,219
people are making this happen and

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,079
and of course to the sponsors who make

00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:46,729
it happen make it possible financially

00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:49,189
the speakers who have put a lot of time

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:53,810
in and all the participants have come

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:57,320
here to get together as i said i work on

00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:59,630
Django CMS we're sponsoring so when we

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,259
are also very busy this week we've got a

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:07,360
Django CMS helpdesk on Thursday we're

00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:10,250
doing a docker workshop on Friday and

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,980
we're sponsoring so and I call it all

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:15,170
excited but this is a great marketing

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,319
opportunity and the best I came up with

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:20,269
is Django CMS we're around your neck so

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,260
I don't know maybe Twitter will come

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,880
alive with the better no I'm going to go

00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,290
into the office and it's get lots of

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,959
congratulations from the team with

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,190
nectar makes a big splash on Twitter

00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:32,569
because I think we're around your neck

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:36,880
actually works really well as a

00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:42,470
marketing thing so I want to talk about

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,420
minds and machines and Python and I have

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:46,609
a tiny amount of Python code in this and

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,160
it's not very impressive and this is

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:51,319
alan turing the great Alan Turing in a

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,590
rare photograph of him smiling and in

00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:58,549
his paper Computing Machinery and

00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:00,620
intelligence in 1950 he turned the

00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:02,690
question of whether machines can think

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,000
on to its head in fact he said the

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,930
question can machines think is to

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,290
meaningless to deserve discussion and

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:15,620
instead of asking whether thought can

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,630
occur inside a computer he wanted us to

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,420
consider whether instead whether a

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:22,489
machine could in principle be

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:24,470
indistinguishable from a human in those

00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:26,720
respects that allow us to say a human

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,700
thinks or has intelligence so he turned

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,459
it the question about machine

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:36,160
intelligence intelligence or upside down

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:38,510
and he was in applying insights from the

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,250
philosophy of mind that emerged in the

00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:44,239
early 20th century which also moved away

00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,819
moved the questions of mind and

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,380
intelligence away from a concern with

00:03:46,819 --> 00:03:50,870
the metaphysics of thought and the

00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:53,810
intrinsic nature of consciousness to

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,180
questions like what constitutes an

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,610
interaction with intelligence or how do

00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,849
we recognize other minds so in other

00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,409
words he was very much in line with all

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:06,230
following the footsteps if that's the

00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:09,319
right word of thinkers like Gilbert Ryle

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:11,390
or Ludwig Wittgenstein who argued the

00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:14,540
search for mine was not a search into

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:16,910
inner mysteries but a matter of

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,340
recognizing what was in front of us all

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:22,490
along so we could say that this

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,910
represents a kind of fork in the study

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:28,280
of artificial intelligence and chilis

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,530
argument in a way freed researchers from

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,870
having to clamber into these kind of

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:37,660
opaque mysteries of what goes on inside

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:41,780
of consciousness and thought and instead

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:44,930
concentrate on producing for example

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,430
interactions that seem like encounters

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,340
with intelligence and that's been the

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:52,639
dominant fork if you like in artificial

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,560
intelligence since then and it's fruits

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,060
are all around us I mean literally in

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,849
our pocket so you've got your your phone

00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:02,360
you can say you know do I need to carry

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:04,430
an umbrella today or you know what's

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,700
what's happening what events are on in

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,160
Bilbao this week and the power of

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,700
machines to recognize stuff like

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,419
languages faces text or road traffic or

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:20,180
not if you're in a Tesla sometime and to

00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:23,660
respond appropriately has suddenly taken

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,750
me by surprise and I think it's taken

00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,270
many people by surprise just how good

00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,889
machines have become at doing this and

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,260
by children's account I really do think

00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:36,949
that we're living at the beginning of an

00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:41,360
age of machine intelligence but what

00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:44,900
about that other fork that lonely ofuro

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,090
which fewer people have worked on and we

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,000
hear less about but people have been

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,889
working there and have been trying to

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,590
unpick these mysteries of thought itself

00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,360
so Turing was a very intelligent thinker

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,030
but just because he dismissed something

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,940
as to meaningless to deserve discussion

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,639
doesn't necessarily mean that that is so

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,409
so here's

00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,030
here to people who thought otherwise who

00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:12,110
disagreed with cheering Joseph wisin

00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,300
bomb in in computer intelligence

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,150
research he was the author of Eliza that

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:19,490
the program Eliza which was his attempt

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:21,590
to demonstrate what in a concrete way

00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:26,629
what was unsatisfactory about curing

00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:30,620
analysis or the philosopher John soul so

00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:32,960
in this talk I want to go back to that

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,389
fork because I also think that touring's

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:39,349
analysis however brilliant and powerful

00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:41,750
it it was is a bit flawed and inadequate

00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,729
and i think that the incredible advances

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,750
of you know the series and the chat BOTS

00:06:43,729 --> 00:06:50,330
and self-driving cars as far as we're

00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:56,810
actually concerned with intelligence I

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:59,120
think those represent a dead end so

00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,849
those things like like chillings

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,219
approach begin from the outside they're

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:06,229
not really i think concerned with the

00:07:04,219 --> 00:07:08,240
nature of intelligence itself but with a

00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:12,289
challenge of creating an appearance of

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,759
it what does intelligence look like what

00:07:12,289 --> 00:07:15,949
does it feel to be in the presence of

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,889
intelligence and in narrow limited

00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:22,400
spheres this appearance can be extremely

00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:24,889
successful and the more successful the

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,440
appearance the more easily we fall into

00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,750
using the language of intelligence

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,129
around that behavior sometimes

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,300
forgetting that i mean some people might

00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:37,370
actually find this contention but i

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,340
think that we're dealing there with a

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:43,039
simulacrum of intelligence that's really

00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:46,849
in the case of say Siri know or or a

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:52,580
tesla car is no closer to consciousness

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:54,229
than a stone and I think the more

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,879
interesting question is the neglected

00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,590
one that begins from the inside that

00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:59,539
asks what lies at the heart of

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:03,169
intelligence how and where does

00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:05,719
consciousness arise and as programmers I

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,219
think we have the concepts and tools to

00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:09,080
investigate this in useful and

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,490
interesting ways I want to argue two

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,860
things in this talk firstly that

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:15,979
programming concepts give us the most

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,529
that the programming concepts that give

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,359
us the most

00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,089
interesting insights are impact the most

00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:22,829
basic programming concepts and that we

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:25,289
can find their counterparts in the work

00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:27,839
of artists poets and writers and that

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,119
this helps us understand so for this

00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,779
will turn to the concept of paresis a

00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:36,839
Greek word it's where the word poetry

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:39,379
come from and it means to make or to

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,699
produce and it doesn't mean making or or

00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:44,759
production in the sense of manufacture

00:08:41,699 --> 00:08:47,670
think of French or Italian verbs like

00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:50,699
fair or fari which they mean at the same

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:52,259
time make and do or think in English

00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:55,680
about the way we would say things like

00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,660
use making friends or making love you

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,759
know that's the kind of making perhaps

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:04,170
that has emerged involved in pisces

00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:06,439
Pisces is not concerned with material or

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,699
technical construction but with

00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:12,540
rendering a transformation in the world

00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:13,829
some an act through which or process

00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,689
through which something new is brought

00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:21,680
forth in paresis and something be kind

00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:24,389
becomes another kind of thing all

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,649
together a new thing emerges out of

00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,649
something something that wasn't there

00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:31,160
before so poetry can be considered a

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:33,980
kind of places and I think that

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,750
programming also represents poesis and

00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,259
that poets and programmers because their

00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:43,740
work is paresis this kind of making can

00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:46,139
help us understand usefully some quite

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,050
deep questions about ourselves and a

00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,879
particular about the nature of our human

00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:53,309
consciousness our thoughts or the mind

00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:57,480
so let's go straight into the work of

00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:59,970
programmers and artists and programmers

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,339
seem to be particularly fascinated by

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,720
ruled government rule governed play when

00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:07,529
they find it and they respond to it

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,559
strongly especially in poetry and art

00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:12,959
for example and there are some poets and

00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,120
artists and writers whose work an idea

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,480
speak very strongly to programmers

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,749
because of this and I think that there's

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,379
something in programming oh no I think

00:10:21,749 --> 00:10:23,610
there's something in the way that

00:10:22,379 --> 00:10:26,100
programmers think that make them

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:28,080
especially ready to understand and

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:30,660
appreciate the intersection of these

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,180
things these work and ideas so there are

00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,160
certain things you know when you that a

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,130
programmer is just going to get a

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:42,030
certain idea or a certain work or

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:43,290
something like that I think part the

00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:46,020
answer is that rule government play

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,110
takes place in systems which of course

00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,270
programmers are also very fascinated by

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,580
and three other things that programmers

00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:57,120
love best in systems are interesting

00:10:53,580 --> 00:11:01,350
outside programming loops self-reference

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,440
and hierarchies and these are also the

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:06,750
things that make rule-governed play very

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,490
interesting and of course it also some

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,670
of the most basic structures and

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:15,480
concepts in programming itself ones that

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:19,920
determine the way programming works so

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,380
let's start with loops even the simplest

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,820
route loop represents power it doesn't

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,130
matter how trivial it is you can still

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,100
unleash something infinite and the

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:32,070
computer will try to realize it so there

00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,350
many constructs in computing this is

00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:36,480
kind of the most basic but also the most

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:40,680
beautiful and powerful I love I love

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,620
loose I'm all of them but still the

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,200
fascination of em go to 10 is quite

00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,910
limited and the only thing interesting

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,560
about that particular loop is that it's

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,590
infinite not because of anything that

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,810
comes out of it so when that's not very

00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,800
interesting but when we apply loops to

00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,230
other things then they get more

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:03,890
intriguing does anybody know we'll

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:06,360
remember the website text arc org and I

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:09,420
used to spend a lot of time there 15

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,640
years or so ago what it does it loops

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,590
over a text and represents it visually

00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,350
and I can't show it to you on a real

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,510
website because it it's so old it's Java

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,130
and I have to load a virtual machine

00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:22,170
running Internet Explorer to do that so

00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:25,140
I'll just have to show this is the text

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,780
of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland okay

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:31,290
right round the edge and then the words

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,690
in the middle are in their place

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,950
depending on where and how many times

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,020
they appear around the end so look

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,760
here's the word and therefore the

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:40,860
character Alice in relation to the

00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,769
entire text or or in relation to the

00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,050
story Alice's

00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:46,420
literally at the center of the story of

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,749
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland here's

00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:53,100
the Griffin as you can see a peripheral

00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:57,269
character here's a linear sequence

00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,670
through the actual text in text dark I

00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,929
go and find them text our kids it's

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:03,399
wonderful if you can get it working on

00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:05,379
your machine if you will find it working

00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,009
on a macbook on a Macintosh tell me how

00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:12,879
because I'd love to get it working again

00:13:08,009 --> 00:13:15,730
so in text art we no longer have a sense

00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,339
of the content of the work but instead

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:22,119
we get its structure exposed by a loop

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:25,029
presented as metadata and structural

00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:27,459
metadata matter we've lost something the

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:31,059
content but we've gained something else

00:13:27,459 --> 00:13:32,910
because it lets us see new meaning that

00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:39,759
perhaps was previously previously

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:42,429
obscured and in the loop of texts are we

00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,739
can see who is associated with whom or

00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:46,449
what we can see who appears when and

00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:49,360
with whom we can see who dominates a

00:13:46,449 --> 00:13:53,529
story and when I say see we literally

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,269
visually can see it so don't be

00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:58,119
distracted that you know text arc is a

00:13:55,269 --> 00:14:00,339
nice is amusing a literary what it does

00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:02,410
is powerful and significant a fact

00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,999
that's not lost on large corporations

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,069
and governments who understand the power

00:14:03,999 --> 00:14:08,889
of this stuff to Google and Facebook

00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:10,540
know all about structure and metadata

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,179
and right now in various countries

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,829
governments are anxious to have

00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:17,410
legislation enacted that will help them

00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:18,999
look more closely at meta data of course

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,259
they never do anything like eavesdrop on

00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:22,329
their citizens because that would be

00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,860
wrong they just want to know you know

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:26,290
some of the metadata surrounding those

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,999
conversations so don't if you can see

00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,949
that from up there so storing metadata

00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:32,110
is not an invasion of privacy it's a

00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:35,259
tool that keeps America safe no one is

00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:37,240
listening to your calls congressman I

00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:39,339
see here last Friday you talked to your

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,339
wife then immediately called next squat

00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,509
service than a hotel of course we don't

00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:50,249
know the content of those calls so

00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:54,420
that's your wife now so this stuff is

00:14:50,249 --> 00:14:56,490
powerful Microsoft I

00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,170
process by chance we use the cloud to

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:03,240
visualize information so we can track

00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:06,959
down the criminals yeah bet you do so on

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,639
text up the first text you get is Hamlet

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,709
it's not there by coincidence

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,350
programmers and people who are doing

00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:16,380
stuff with language always go for Hamlet

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:18,690
sorry Alice o Hamlet these are the two

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,870
texts they always go for there's

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:26,220
something special about these two takes

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:29,160
here's Hamlet and here's Lisa scary on

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:33,089
his he was a mexican artist and I did

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,010
she play you a part of his Hamlet for

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,050
two voices I've got to pin this down and

00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:42,449
we don't have direct audio so i'll just

00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:45,480
do this to you Bernardo Francisco

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:48,389
Bernardo Francisco DiNardo Francisco

00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:51,630
Bernardo Francisco General Francisco

00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:54,870
Bernardo Francisco Horatio my sales

00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:59,310
Francisco Marcellus Francisco my cells

00:15:54,870 --> 00:16:00,480
you're not ok so I think this is I think

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:02,519
this is hilarious i think it's very

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,310
funny but i also think it's not just

00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,050
funny it's a new interpretation of

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,850
Hamlet it's a hamlet for two voices left

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:11,850
and right it's the whole of Hamlet it

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:15,300
lasts about 15 minutes like that without

00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:18,329
any Content whatsoever all we have is

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,880
the structure so what have we lost and

00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:22,140
what are we left with well it's true

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,029
that you won't know from this that

00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,560
Hamlet is about revenge or murder or

00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:28,019
this iron you won't know that Hamlet's a

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:29,940
prince or the story set in Denmark but

00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,620
there's a lot to learn we know who's

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,060
there at the beginning we know who's

00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,110
there at the end which is you know if

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,779
you're there at the end in a Shakespeare

00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:40,010
tragedy then that's a big deal you know

00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:43,410
not everybody gets to be at the end and

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:45,300
we can discover whom the story revolves

00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:47,160
around who dominates the conversations

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,920
who hangs around with whom who answers

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:51,449
whoo so we've lost something we've

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,089
deliberately thrown some information

00:16:51,449 --> 00:16:56,310
away but we've exposed perhaps some

00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:58,170
previously hidden information at the

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,170
same time now when I pay this to other

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,949
people and one at first it what is this

00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:06,000
and then it divides the world up into

00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:09,980
programmers and non

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,050
members because not non-programmers say

00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:14,970
what's the point and they're baffled or

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,780
even irritated and I've had people

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:23,670
really annoyed by that um but program is

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:26,699
not it now you may all the program is if

00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:30,180
you didn't love that then maybe just

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,980
don't have the soul of a programmer so

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,780
because it also some people who are not

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,700
programmers love that so maybe there are

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,890
non programmers who have the soul of

00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,570
programmers but anyway the point is that

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,160
programmers get this kind of thing they

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:43,200
understand loops they understand what's

00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,990
important about metadata and they know

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:48,570
how to recognize a key value pair when

00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:50,190
they see one so you know you show me

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:51,510
some key value pairs and well I'll show

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:56,970
you some code actually so let me quickly

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:59,430
jump into here so I've got a little

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,680
program a little Python program okay and

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:03,480
it just jumps onto the internet it uses

00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,780
beautiful soup this is a very useful

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:13,190
library for exploring structured text

00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:17,370
like HTML it loops through the text

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:19,530
drags things out and in pairs and then

00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:25,610
passes them to the sacrum and so I'm

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:25,610
going to this is my little tribute to

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:36,630
Bernardo Francisca Bernardo Francisco

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:40,860
Bernardo Francisco Bernardo Francisco

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:45,210
Bernardo Francisco Bernardo Francisco

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:47,450
Horatio marcellus san Cisco Marcellus

00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:55,620
thank you I'm just messing up for that

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:57,960
um so computers are perfect tools for

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,660
this kind of thing for the exploration

00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,240
the analysis discovery of tests and

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,450
language and if you're interested in

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:08,370
doing that it's very easy and accessible

00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,280
stuff to do what could you discover with

00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:13,350
a simple program you know like text arc

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,750
or something like this and could you

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,550
extract the punctuation from a text

00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,530
maybe and recognize the author by the

00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:21,600
punctuation or by the white space I

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,360
spent a lot of time with a raspberry pi

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:29,430
and a little LED an array of LEDs

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:33,690
visualizing the characters in Hamlet as

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:36,360
kind of spiraling outward different

00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,700
colored lights so it's promptly even if

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,410
you're a lousy programmer like me

00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:42,300
there's a massive amount of this stuff

00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:44,040
going on in the world of literature

00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:46,320
there's a whole field of experimental

00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:48,150
literature that analyzes text

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,040
synthesizes them deconstructs them

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:52,560
there's the early part of whether

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:55,950
literature but until the workshop of

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,930
potential literature French mostly

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,930
French writers mathematicians and

00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,760
artists and don't really have time to

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:06,300
talk too much about that but and I

00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,650
recommend having a look at that or and

00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,200
you don't have to go to experimental

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:11,850
literature here a couple of pages from

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,250
Douglas Krypton's micro serfs the foul

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,790
is on one page and the consonants on the

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:20,730
other and and we can play endless games

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:25,350
fun games illuminating games with texts

00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:27,270
like this and i'm talking about games

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,250
and playing and some of it's fun but

00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:32,880
it's also serious because play doesn't

00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:35,340
just refer to having fun play means the

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,930
looseness in a manacle mechanical

00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,340
connection you say has a lot of play in

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,130
this connection when the connections not

00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,100
typed the extent to which one site side

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:47,880
of a connection is free and undetermined

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,220
by the other and play is only possible

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,290
where you have a linkage where you have

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,730
a connection of constraint if they were

00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,230
no constraint at all then there would be

00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:58,520
nothing they won't you wouldn't have any

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:00,570
play you've just have no connection and

00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:02,550
on the other hand if the connection was

00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:04,650
so tight that it were locked solid there

00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:06,030
would be no play either so you only find

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:10,650
it where there's a connection and where

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:12,420
the joints permit some movement and the

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,840
rules and connections in language are

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:19,400
just open and enough and open and loose

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,140
enough for both rigorous meaning and

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,990
play within the same system which is

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,790
quite remarkable and this kind of player

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,020
something that's enjoyed an exploited by

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,350
artists and right

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,750
and programmers so we seen some examples

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,030
of looping in text darken and in Hamlet

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,710
this kind of play becomes even more

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:41,190
interesting when the looping becomes

00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:43,170
self referential so his elise's carry on

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,120
again with this first spanish lesson i

00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:47,790
know so you already know spanish but

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:54,270
Bellamy pay you his first lesson so this

00:21:47,790 --> 00:22:02,510
is fiendish espanol ES peor es español

00:21:54,270 --> 00:22:09,000
es espanol SI es español es espanol SI

00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:14,150
es español es español español SI es

00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,890
español es español es es español español

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:24,000
SI es español es español es SI es

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:30,000
español español si si es español es

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:34,490
español es si es español español si si

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:39,000
es español es español es si es espanol

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:46,530
no c SI no es español es ese no es

00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:48,810
español español c SN o ok so I am this

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:53,340
is language about language this is

00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:55,590
language looping over its own structures

00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,470
recursing on itself its language eating

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,470
language and now again you know play

00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:04,740
this to people and and watch people get

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:07,140
angry and angrier as this goes don't you

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,930
know definitely not people with the

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,610
souls of programmers and I had one

00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:15,230
person turn on me off for few minutes to

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:15,230
say this is a way to learn Spanish

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:25,970
so am I love this look up looses carrion

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:27,590
bless him he died young and this is so

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,409
fascinating now usually when something

00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:35,200
consumes itself in this way it reduces

00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:35,200
itself to nothingness but in this case

00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:40,549
something new something other seems to

00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:42,080
be coming out something new and almost

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,720
magical you know something exciting

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,480
maddening about it and it's a perfect

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,600
example of playing with rules and

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,820
processes so it's a programmer you know

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,509
it makes you itch of it in a way this is

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,820
a program that follows its own internal

00:23:56,509 --> 00:24:01,279
logic obeys its own rules and it makes

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:04,789
me think how could we make first typing

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:09,379
lesson in in the same way and you know

00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:13,039
we have the technology we could get

00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:15,289
Python to consume itself and regenerate

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,000
itself like this but I got distracted by

00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:18,889
my Raspberry Pi in the colored LEDs and

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,389
so I never really got much much further

00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:24,230
than that but you know maybe somebody's

00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:26,899
a better programmer and less easily the

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:30,139
less easily distracted could come and

00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:32,299
talk to me about that so it's a kind of

00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:36,230
impossible magic when you make something

00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:39,009
eat itself but it's a very old a very

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,899
ancient concept so here's the rub Ross

00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:43,490
the snake that eats its own pale and

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:46,039
it's very important it it visits

00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:47,179
chemists in their dreams as you'll know

00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:51,049
if you've studied the chemistry so

00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:53,330
August kekulé is had a dream of the

00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:54,860
snake eating its tail and providing him

00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,899
with the solution to the puzzle of the

00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:00,259
the benzene molecule after many years of

00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:01,940
studying carbon carbon bonding it's an

00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:06,220
ancient symbol of renewal and

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:08,269
regeneration in many cultures and

00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:11,000
programmers as much as artists are

00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:14,419
fascinated by what happens when a self

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,980
reflecting process oops and as

00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:18,169
programmers we're particularly lucky

00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,049
because we've got the perfect tools with

00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:24,139
which to explore it

00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:25,580
and I was mentioned magic you know it's

00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:28,159
a kind of impossible magic but the magic

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:31,279
is not just as snake bites its own tail

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,110
because you know any idiot dog can bite

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:36,470
its own tail and not produce anything

00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:39,019
magical the magic lies when something

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:42,080
eats itself and then somehow sustains

00:25:39,019 --> 00:25:45,470
itself and then something new emerges

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,119
something that wasn't there before and I

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,100
think it happens in will exist carry on

00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,249
something new comes out of the loop that

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,919
wasn't in it when we started a new thing

00:25:52,249 --> 00:25:56,509
altogether and this is the PO ases that

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,419
we're in search of or maybe I'm in

00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:01,909
search of here's another representation

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:04,039
of the rover us this time back the

00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:05,869
artist MC Escher who's also fascinated

00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:06,950
by loops and self reference so woodblock

00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:11,960
print with some very interesting things

00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:14,570
going on when is this loop begin how is

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,950
OS it's a loop well is it one loop or is

00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,230
it several routes was there are four

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:22,580
bands going out to make is that five

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:26,359
loops is it for loops is it one do it's

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:30,230
looping on different levels you have to

00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:33,049
choose the level at which you see it

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,190
looping you have to make a decision to

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:38,059
hold in your mind when you look at it

00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:40,580
there's a hierarchy of looping going on

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:43,279
and this is where things get really

00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,109
interesting here's Douglas Hofstadter I

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,029
think he's possibly the most one of the

00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:49,909
most interesting thinkers you could ever

00:26:47,029 --> 00:26:53,179
hope to read a book by he's interested

00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:56,269
in hierarchies in multiple tangled

00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:58,029
hierarchies of self-referential oops his

00:26:56,269 --> 00:27:02,230
best-known book his girdle I Shabak

00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:05,299
which explores art music logic and

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:07,369
consciousness and it's a an utterly

00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:09,289
remarkable book driven by this

00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:12,080
fascination with loops and self

00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:14,029
reflecting processes and he's in search

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,409
of the ultimate in self-reflection which

00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:21,190
is our own human self-consciousness

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:23,929
subjectivity itself and the book itself

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,639
loops and recursos and reflects itself

00:27:23,929 --> 00:27:29,840
at different levels in its own structure

00:27:25,639 --> 00:27:31,950
and he's interested in what could emerge

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,440
from this kind of process

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:39,630
and it's a work a book whose humour and

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,539
sense of aesthetics will appeal very

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:44,909
naturally to programmers and here's ha

00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:46,769
starters law it always takes longer than

00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:48,929
you expect even when you take into

00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:51,409
account hofstadter's law may ask

00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:56,820
programmers love this kind of stuff and

00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:59,970
so we've talked about emergence where

00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:04,250
something new and unexpected comes out

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:07,139
of a process at some other level i

00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:10,980
started in interested in these emergent

00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:13,740
properties of systems an emergent

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,580
property is one that arises in a system

00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,269
but can't be found in its components so

00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:20,399
sometimes the property might be

00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:24,720
geometrical order this is a rocks in a

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,220
river where water erosion has produced

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,539
this remarkable effect you know the

00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,110
rocks aren't shaped like that because of

00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,669
some structure of the rocks it's an

00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,010
inter there's nothing in the rocks that

00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:37,230
represents those that structure that's

00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:42,149
only an interaction between the rocks

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:43,440
and the water and the water doing

00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:47,279
something to the rocks and the rocks in

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,240
turn doing something to the water so the

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,010
rocks themselves don't have that

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,510
structure at all another example might

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:53,220
be an ant column where column

00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:55,799
organization is nowhere to be found in

00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,860
the behavior of individual ants you know

00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:02,450
you don't see ants doing that you can't

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:07,110
predict it and yet a column a new system

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:08,700
emerges that didn't exist before or in

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,130
art and the work of bridget riley where

00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,279
symp the procedure she follows a line

00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,500
down a page and it produces through the

00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:18,630
natural free play of this activity

00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:22,500
something that's not in any of its

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:25,100
components or Google's deep dream that

00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,720
uses iterated pattern searching and

00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:29,039
generation algorithms and matches parts

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,720
two holes and crosses levels of

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:39,980
hierarchy and new levels of significance

00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:43,080
emerge or an evolution natural selection

00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,250
in nature itself can be considered an

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,260
emergent properties

00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:50,370
team that comes out of basic chemical or

00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:52,230
biological processes and there are

00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:56,880
multiple levels of hierarchy in these

00:29:52,230 --> 00:30:01,200
systems other properties in nature

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:04,380
themselves are the emergent features of

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,810
evolution so this property that came out

00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,570
in turn feeds back into the system so

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,550
there are numerous behaviors in nature

00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:13,350
whose explanations have been sought in

00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,630
emergence like cooperative behavior

00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:17,400
which is hard to explain sometimes why

00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,160
is their cooperation within or even

00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,020
between species when it would seem that

00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:24,540
at the level individuals is no such

00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:27,450
benefit and so this graph is from a

00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:30,210
Python library axelrod and it shows the

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:33,570
successes over time of different

00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:37,470
strategies in a tournament of the

00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:40,950
iterated prisoner's dilemma which was

00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:45,360
set up as a search for the secret of

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:47,640
cooperation in evolution first by Robert

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,100
Axelrod who was a political scientist in

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,290
the nineteen eighty in the first

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,520
tournament selfish strategies did poorly

00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,870
you know that the prison I don't have

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,490
time to explain the prisoner's dilemma

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,480
but I think probably most programmers

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:03,540
are aware look up the prisoner's dilemma

00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,730
selfish strategies did poorly and last

00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,350
year my friend Vincent night at Cardiff

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:10,530
University implemented this is a Python

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:12,480
library and it's you can play you can

00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:15,030
develop your own strategy and put it

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:20,940
into the tournament and it's been wildly

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:23,100
successful and has reignited interest in

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,990
in Axelrod and the prisoner's dilemma

00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:31,160
very interesting so I have a look at

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:33,210
Axelrod so those are all examples of

00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,500
emergent properties or different kinds

00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,360
not all of them have anything to do with

00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,680
consciousness of course but Hofstadter

00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:45,590
argues that consciousness intelligence

00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:49,290
is an emergent property that arises from

00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:51,420
systems in the brain and we discuss

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,370
loops first of all and the magic that

00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,710
seems to follow in loops become self

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,210
referential and something new Springs

00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:58,409
out of them and then

00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:00,029
Hoff's others are also interested in

00:31:58,409 --> 00:32:01,710
hierarchy so that we have loops within

00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:06,740
loops and loops at different levels in

00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:06,740
the system and his thesis is that

00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:12,210
hierarchies of self reflecting or self

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,840
similar loops that repeat themselves at

00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:18,690
different levels lie at the heart of

00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:22,409
cognition and consciousness that the

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:25,409
brains and neurological processes are

00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:30,770
themselves based on loops and self

00:32:25,409 --> 00:32:30,770
reference and logic and play

00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:37,140
consciousness he says it is an emergent

00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:38,279
property it doesn't exist in the neurons

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,840
of the brain you know if your

00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:44,610
intelligence it's not because you have

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:47,580
really intelligent neurons you won't

00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:51,090
find intelligence or consciousness by

00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:55,260
looking in to the brain and looking more

00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:56,730
closely at its neurons if we're going to

00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:59,909
find something there it will be by

00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:06,029
studying the system what happens in and

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:08,760
to and between its loops so this rep

00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:10,740
know here we are we worthy this is again

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:15,720
this is the impossible magic where

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:20,340
something emerges reflects on itself

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:23,669
feeds back into itself crossing these

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:25,860
levels of hierarchy Hofstadter thinks

00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:28,470
that or argues that this is the origin

00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:31,860
of consciousness that self-referring

00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:37,080
hierarchies of loops right at the secret

00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:40,260
of thinking of cognition in these merely

00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,360
physical processes in which absolutely

00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:45,260
no consciousness resides because they're

00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:50,640
merely physical processes consciousness

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:54,120
belongs at a different dimension so good

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,830
consciousness be a system that nourishes

00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,429
itself like a snake eating its tail

00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,630
apparently impossibly and I've sada

00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:04,289
think so in fact one of his later books

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:08,760
is cold I am a strange loop and the eye

00:34:04,289 --> 00:34:10,610
of our consciousness of subjectivity is

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,510
this process of looping and

00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:16,990
referring across hierarchies so now that

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:19,280
talking about intelligence and

00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:22,430
programming in a very different way from

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,710
the one that followed during we're

00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:26,660
talking way in ways that I think do make

00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:29,630
it possible to ask meaningful questions

00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:31,940
about whether machines could think and

00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,460
it raises the possibility of an approach

00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,440
into cognition research and artificial

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,290
artificial intelligence that's quite

00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,960
unlike some of the ones we see at the

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:46,310
moment there are premise million big

00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:48,410
data and huge ontology zand brute forces

00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:51,770
unkind but I'm an open person you know

00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:54,530
on vast computing power and instead we

00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:57,080
begin with the simplest of things like

00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:01,820
the simplest concepts and tools that we

00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:03,620
as programmers enjoy playing with play

00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,930
itself we enjoy playing with play with

00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:11,420
rules with poesis with analogy making

00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:14,210
with processes so this approach comes

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:18,950
into the question of consciousness of

00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:23,720
intelligence as paresis as a processes

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:28,640
that is at the same time transformative

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:31,910
that brings forth something new out of

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,010
the well go into the world and I think

00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:37,330
it's very intellectually compelling and

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:39,740
I think at the same time however

00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:42,200
philosophy philosophically profound it

00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,750
might be the opportunities for exploring

00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:47,240
it are right at the hand of even the

00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:55,850
most novice Python programmer which is

00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:57,950
also a fascinating thing and it gives us

00:35:55,850 --> 00:36:00,500
a way into this quest that seems very

00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:02,420
rich and valuable and illuminating and

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,420
rich for it it's rich for exploration

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:06,980
especially by us by programmers but it's

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,260
more than that because I think it does

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,060
something even more important it gives

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,520
us a way to look for not just uttered

00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:17,600
them insight into artificial

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,970
intelligence but just into intelligence

00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,280
itself and i think the kind of post

00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:25,490
cheering way

00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,360
of doing this doesn't give us any of

00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:33,410
those insights and you know i don't

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:36,080
think that microsoft you know mike

00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:38,870
taylor microsoft Hitler running hit a

00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,400
loving sex maniac chatbot on Twitter

00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,480
that I don't think that tells us

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,900
anything about the nature of

00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,850
intelligence however clever it might be

00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,530
and the question of where the Hofstadter

00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:49,910
in the end is is right or wrong I don't

00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,530
think right or wrong I don't think is

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:52,850
that important it doesn't matter whether

00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:56,720
he's on the right track about the nature

00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:58,790
of consciousness and cognition and his

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,140
ideas are so beautiful and powerful and

00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:02,900
compelling that we should wrestle with

00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:08,150
them anyway I think certainly more

00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:10,250
elegant than traore Siri or all these

00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:17,780
other things that people are doing very

00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:19,550
clever things with and my backgrounds

00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,320
not in programming but in philosophy

00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:26,330
I've been wrestling with Hofstadter in

00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:31,070
these ideas for you so a long time and

00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:33,230
it's it's really wonderful it delights

00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,220
me that I'm happy to delights me that

00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,760
I'm able to be in the company of

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,020
programmers who find this stuff by there

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,240
because they've got the right souls they

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:46,430
find this stuff so fascinating

00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:48,410
immediately and are also fine are also

00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,750
fascinated by the poets and writers and

00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:56,630
artists that fascinate me and these

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:58,370
things that I found in programming in a

00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,650
way it come back in a circle for me

00:37:58,370 --> 00:38:02,390
because it's another pleasing circle or

00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:05,120
something going back to the beginning

00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:06,800
these philosophical questions that have

00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:09,830
been with me for decades so it's like a

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,650
snake eating its tail again and there

00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:15,200
are some references for you if you want

00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,670
to follow up any of these things I've

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,550
got my Douglas Hofstadter in that bag

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:21,320
it's just falling apart it's been with

00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:26,240
me for a long time and I'm very grateful

00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:32,030
to Douglas Hofstadter so I haven't

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:34,040
really um haven't really taken to it but

00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:35,380
I hope I've given you something to think

00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,640
about and I

00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,690
some people come up to me who's a better

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,210
programmer and give me some better code

00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,710
that I can maybe develop this talking

00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:47,500
something that does a bit more Python

00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:50,140
and a little less talking so am thank

00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:53,519
you very much I think what time for a

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,519
few questions have we ya thang

00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:06,660
so and I should say a colleague of mine

00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,940
had two wasn't able to come so I'm doing

00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,710
another talk in case you didn't get sick

00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:12,450
of hearing me already on Thursday on

00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,280
documentation driven development so

00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:17,040
please if you've got any questions I'm

00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,329
happy to talk to you now or later that's

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,329
good here

00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:28,380
and so I heard some critique of like

00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:30,690
this sort of big data approach to

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:32,010
building intelligence systems and

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:33,090
perhaps you can say that there you

00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,640
cannot really call them fully

00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:37,950
intelligent in the moment but imagine

00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,960
they they succeeded and they made and

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,610
they made like a talking and thinking

00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,270
Robert that you can have a conversation

00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:46,530
with I guess you would still say that

00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,720
this is just a simulation of

00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:50,610
intelligence so I wonder in your view of

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,720
what is the difference between a real

00:39:50,610 --> 00:40:02,400
intelligence and simulated intelligence

00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:06,480
and well if Hofstadter is right we could

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:10,980
have an artificial intelligence and I'm

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:16,680
not sure that he is right but I'd be

00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:19,520
much more prepared to admit of a hot

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,140
start alike in artificial intelligence

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,530
than one that is based on you know this

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:33,170
as you say the brute force big data

00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:38,900
mining and machine learning because I

00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:41,610
don't think a simulation is good enough

00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,470
something that's artificial is different

00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,120
from something that's a simulation just

00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:47,160
because something art is artificial

00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:53,480
doesn't mean it's not real yeah it just

00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:53,480
means that it's been made and

00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:59,880
so we could have a real intelligence a

00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:01,890
real intelligence that's artificial but

00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,659
a real intelligent intelligence that's

00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,789
simulated it sounds like a contradiction

00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:10,169
in terms of it's merely a simulation

00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:11,640
however good it gets because what's

00:41:10,169 --> 00:41:13,109
going on in I think the question of

00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:16,969
what's going on inside actually does

00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:16,969
matter I do that once your question or

00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:35,009
yeah well this is this is touring's

00:41:30,539 --> 00:41:38,159
argument it just seems unsatisfactory to

00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:44,609
me I we do care what's inside are there

00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:49,079
in your questions here one could take

00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:53,279
even a more recursive point of view

00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:57,929
about that question that is we we solve

00:41:53,279 --> 00:42:03,630
a the Spanish lesson the Spanish lesson

00:41:57,929 --> 00:42:06,959
basically points to the the idea of an

00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:09,659
infinite string of a Spanish Spanish

00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:13,469
Spanish you get what I mean but the

00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:16,859
thing is that you get a better but

00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:21,779
concept exists linguistically still is

00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:27,539
infinite is not is like ave a fixed

00:42:21,779 --> 00:42:30,539
point of an infinite sequence so we

00:42:27,539 --> 00:42:32,999
through language we can we can even

00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:36,809
represent that sort of thing fixed

00:42:32,999 --> 00:42:40,439
points of infinite sequences but sort of

00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:43,559
thing sometimes don't exist so we we

00:42:40,439 --> 00:42:46,349
have signifiers without without

00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:47,969
cinephile and the thing is that

00:42:46,349 --> 00:42:53,639
intelligence itself may be something

00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:55,769
without us inside also the you know the

00:42:53,639 --> 00:43:00,199
first spanish lesson I'm afraid is a bit

00:42:55,769 --> 00:43:02,399
of a trick because it's not just folding

00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:04,390
entirely by itself there's actually the

00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:05,980
director the artist who

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:08,650
makes it go in the right directions it's

00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:11,380
not simply putting espanol at the

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,089
beginning of everything it's choosing

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,410
the right things and it's playing with

00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:15,789
them for example the fact that some

00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,529
things are homophones in that you know

00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:19,269
that the same sounds can be rendered

00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:21,480
differently so it can keep asking the

00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:23,890
question so it would actually be and

00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,160
less interesting if it weren't directed

00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:32,019
so there is some energy going into that

00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,760
system from outside and that I think is

00:43:32,019 --> 00:43:44,380
if there's something wrong with hof sada

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:47,339
that's probably where it lies hello oh

00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:51,670
yeah we got time for one more question

00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:54,730
hello and good talk do you think that

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:56,769
maybe neural Nets combine the two

00:43:54,730 --> 00:44:01,210
approaches to artificial intelligence as

00:43:56,769 --> 00:44:04,630
in neural Nets have maybe this emergent

00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:07,900
feature to them which might be described

00:44:04,630 --> 00:44:09,460
as emergence conscience yes I mean that

00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,220
seems to be very promising and

00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,049
interesting because they one of the

00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:16,210
things that we've learned from your own

00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:23,579
networks is that they sometimes do

00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:26,289
unexpected things and not just

00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:29,410
unexpected things that it was left

00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:32,410
instead of right but new orders of

00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,990
things sometimes where a neural network

00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:38,500
will have an answer I have a response

00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:40,900
that seems to have stepped out and be

00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:44,710
looking at the thing from a different

00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:46,509
level so that might be a very I don't

00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:48,880
know enough about neural networks

00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:50,950
actually to say anything that useful but

00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,900
what I've understood is that actually

00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,900
that is a promising possibility

00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:57,450
you

00:45:16,049 --> 00:45:21,039
that is the kind of thing Corey I think

00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,809
that might just be the start of the kind

00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,789
of thing and we'll find more surprising

00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:26,500
things still I'm sure we can take more

00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:30,150
questions offline but I have to cut you

00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,150
