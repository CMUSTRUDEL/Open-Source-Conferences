Developers usually state that finding defects is the primary
motivation for doing code reviews. However, research has shown that
the main benefits of code reviews are; knowledge transfer, team
awareness and finding alternative solutions.

Code reviews when done well are more than just finding defects; it
should be a discussion and conversation with other developers about
finding the best solutions. We will talk about re-framing code review
to encourage open discussions.

-----

This talk is for everyone that is already involved in regular code
review and those hoping to start. I will talk through the code review
process with the aim of making it a better and more useful experience
for both the authors and the reviewers.

The talk will follow the following rough outline:

- Introduction
  - Why do code reviews
  - What are we aiming to get out of it
- Submitting code for review
  - How can you help reviewers?
  - What should you avoid doing?

  - How should you give feedback?
  - What should you look for?
  - How can you encourage people to review more?
  - How to avoid and remove bike-shedding
- Code review tools and how they impact on the process.
