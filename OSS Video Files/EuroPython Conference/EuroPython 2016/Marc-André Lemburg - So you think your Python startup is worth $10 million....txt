This talk is based on a recent consulting project the speaker ran to
support the valuation of a Python startup company in the due diligence
phase.

By following some of the advice from this talk, you should be possible
to improve the valuation of your Python startup or consulting business
in preparation for investment rounds or an acquisition.

-----

This talk is based on the speaker's experience running a Python
focused software company for more than 15 years and a recent
consulting project to support the valuation of a Python startup
company in the due diligence phase.

For the valuation we had to come up with metrics, a catalog of
criteria analyzing risks, potential and benefits of the startup's
solution, as well as an estimate for how much effort it would take to
reimplement the solution from scratch.

In the talk, I am going to show the metrics we used, how they can be
applied to Python code, the importance of addressing risk factors,
well designed code and data(base) structures.

By following some of the advice from this talk, you should be able to
improve the valuation of your startup or consulting business in
preparation for investment rounds or an acquisition.

he's and gentlemen marc-andre lemberg

00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:10,590
give him big hand so thanks again for

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,250
dinner for the very nice intro it's

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,470
going to be hard to live up to that

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,140
right so I'm going to talk about a

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,630
project rank we did end of last year I'm

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:23,789
mark Lemberg I spin around in the

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,340
pathway with you for four Lots 19 years

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,070
I'm also one of the European organizers

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,859
the rest you can read here it's not that

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,770
important so this is the agenda for the

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:38,640
talk quite a few slides hope I can show

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:42,660
all of them so what what what was the

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,000
outset of this this project we were

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,309
asked last year we were asked by a let's

00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,219
say a big company because I can't give

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,079
any details I signed an NDA for this so

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,289
a big company wanted to smile a small

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,530
company doing Python development

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,180
internally and they wanted to know how

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,180
much they're passing car was actually

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,610
worth so what the value was of the IT

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,369
that Diane and because they didn't have

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:10,049
any IT skills interval for specifically

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:13,770
for Python internally because they're

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:17,100
mostly you java a company they asked us

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,780
to help them and so we had very little

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,759
time to do this we just had two or three

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,070
weeks to actually run the whole project

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,040
from so we basically we knew nothing

00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,479
about valuation of companies and we have

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,600
to come up with a few things and we

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,490
thought that might be good idea to try a

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,020
few different models and then maybe do

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,570
some averages and then maybe do some

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,600
calculation and come up with some value

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,840
that we give them and they like that and

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,340
so we did that so first disclaimer the

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,180
stuff that I'm talking about here not an

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,360
expert in we basically just kind of did

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,250
some research shows some some different

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,159
methods and there's different tools to

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,170
use and then when went ahead with it and

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,369
mixed all that with our experience in

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,200
running these projects so what do you

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,500
have to do if you want to assign a value

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,140
to a to an IT startup well first of all

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,299
you have the business value that is

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,920
something that I'm not

00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:16,680
because the company that themselves I

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,200
had experts for that plus of course if

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,639
it's IT focus then you have the IT value

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,989
of the company and that's where we came

00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:29,879
in so both sides of course have risks

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:32,510
and so you need to address those risks

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,530
when you when you value the company

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,019
again the business side we did not

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,169
really participate much in but what we

00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:42,209
did do is we when we looked at the code

00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:44,370
base that they had created and the way

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,879
that I had set up their systems we found

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,769
a few issues with that that were also

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,579
going for example into the area of data

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:56,040
security or maybe patent patents and

00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:57,750
then trademark infringement and also

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,139
where things that we basically taught

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:03,900
the business side of the company to to

00:03:00,139 --> 00:03:08,120
take into account and take that risk

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,739
into account and then we came in to then

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,109
judge through the IT risks that they had

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:18,979
so this is just a list of IT risks that

00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:23,189
you usually find in larger projects and

00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:25,379
so we had to look at at the edgy side of

00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:28,199
this valuation process so this is what

00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,849
we what we set out to do and we told the

00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:31,889
company would they were fine with doing

00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,599
that so first we sat down with the team

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:35,519
we try to analyze the team who try to

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,680
figure out where the developers were any

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,389
good whether the system was any good

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,620
where the data that they had was any

00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:45,150
good and it turn out to be very good and

00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:47,909
then of course we wanted to add some

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,989
scientific approach to this so we of

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:54,750
course we use Wikipedia and then search

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,639
tab it around for possible ways of doing

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,049
valuation we found this kokomo model

00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,540
which seems to be a standard in the

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:02,459
industry for doing these kinds of things

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,489
of course the space on C C++ and Java

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,729
it's not based on Python and we found

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,979
out about that later on in the process

00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:12,870
and a second model we use an effort

00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:14,759
model which is basically well I'm going

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,370
to talk about later on anyway and then

00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:18,900
you get some basic value for the you for

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:22,289
the whole thing and then you apply some

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,470
soft values or you remove some soft

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,300
values if you find risk for example

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,520
from the from the value that you get and

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,699
we call this we call this added value

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,560
and then you get one final value which

00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:36,750
is kind of the estimate based on models

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
and then you go ahead and then you try

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:40,190
to figure out what would it cost to

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,229
rebuild this whole thing from scratch

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,819
and you give a value for that and then

00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,770
in the end that the company has to

00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:49,530
decide whether to either buy the company

00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,650
and then maybe run with that company or

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,169
maybe instead use the approach of

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,889
building everything themselves which

00:04:55,169 --> 00:05:01,860
might actually be cheaper so let's look

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,199
at the analysis part as I said we have

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,630
quite a few soft factors we have some

00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,759
factors that we can actually measure so

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,169
you have code metrics and you always

00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,669
have to take into account that you

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:13,259
cannot possibly look at everything in

00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:14,729
that short time frame so you have to

00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,009
build in some risk buffer for

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,800
inaccuracies that you know you're going

00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,720
to have in your estimate and so for the

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,310
first thing we just sat down with the T

00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,169
we discuss everything we try to figure

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,800
out as much as possible from them we had

00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:31,349
we had a list of questions something

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,690
like 200 questions for them to answer we

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:36,030
went through that in a meeting for a

00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:40,919
complete day and got all the information

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:43,169
from them and that's also how we found

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,210
out about things that were like risks

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:49,169
for example that they had not really

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,210
addressed yet that would have would that

00:05:49,169 --> 00:05:52,680
the the big company bangle the small

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,409
company would have to address in that

00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,449
small company in order to fit their own

00:05:55,409 --> 00:06:01,770
corporate standards and then we had to

00:06:00,449 --> 00:06:03,240
check the code that was fairly easy

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,000
because they're tools for this and then

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:08,430
again you have throw in some experience

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,120
to to measure the risk buffer that you

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,849
have to add to this so let's have a look

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,440
at how you can measure the code metrics

00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:19,530
there's this nice Python to record raid

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:23,840
on which you just throw at your Python

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:26,699
code and it just runs through the whole

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,650
repository that you have and it then

00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,479
takes all the easy different details

00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,729
from that code and and gives you nice

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,250
summary reports and outputs all the

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:37,430
stuff that you need to know about think

00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:41,639
I just skip this slide

00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,440
yeah so the standard terms that you have

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,690
in encode metrics on of course lines of

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,810
code then source lines of code which is

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:51,930
basically just lines of code without the

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,370
comments and the Ducks rings logical

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,500
lines of code is something special it's

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,720
actually just code that gets executed so

00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,250
for example if you have a for statement

00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,080
and the the for line itself is not

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,320
necessarily executed it's just that the

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,419
the inner loop is executed so you just

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,520
count those lines then you have blank

00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,229
lines of course and especially important

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,650
in Python because blank lines are white

00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:17,729
space and we love white space right so

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,360
so with the more white space the better

00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:23,070
the better you can read the code you

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,840
also have to look at at lines of code

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,610
per module and then can use that as

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,729
basis for how maintainable that code is

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,139
from just looking at these numbers so

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:32,760
the more lines of code you have two

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,650
modules or more classes and methods and

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,599
everything you have for pure module then

00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,000
the harder you really get to maintain

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,710
that code it's usually better to break

00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,490
modules and smaller pieces and then do

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:46,169
it that way so radar helps with this it

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:48,270
also helps with figuring out whether you

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,789
have enough inline documentation which I

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,180
find very important to have in code base

00:07:50,789 --> 00:07:56,849
I very often get to see code written by

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,650
companies that don't have a lot of

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:00,150
inline documentation and so basically

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,250
all the documentation about the code

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,979
itself is either somewhere else oh it's

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,830
just nowhere so it doesn't exist so

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:11,610
having dark strings inline comments or

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:14,550
it's a good thing so they get they get a

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,590
plus added value for that if they going

00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,699
to show this so in this particular case

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,220
it was kind of average not that not

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:26,580
really that good then you have two

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,260
measurements that that take all this

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,789
data and then also add some extra

00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,260
information from the code base where

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:32,849
they actually parse the code and then

00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,919
try to figure out how many decision

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,260
notes you have in your in your execution

00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,270
tree so for example an if statement

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,830
would be a decision node and the more

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,750
decision notes you have four per

00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:46,050
function and the high the complexity and

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,550
so higher values are worse or get more

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,589
complexity and lower values

00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,839
better it's similar with the

00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,390
maintainability index except as the

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,850
other way around so the maintainability

00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,740
index takes the complexity the density

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,240
lines of code and everything puts

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,640
everything together into nice huge

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,670
formula and gives you this index and you

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,950
higher values for better maintainability

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:10,019
again you can use radon for this so this

00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,820
is what we used as part of the input for

00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,180
the evaluation then we had a look at the

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,930
test coverage so we had them give us all

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,850
the output of the coverage py we also

00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,320
check for end-to-end tests which are

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,750
very important so those are things that

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,190
usually don't cover with unit tests so

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,070
you actually have someone sitting there

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,990
or maybe you have selenium sitting there

00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,730
and entering your stuff into your day

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,500
into your web application and you check

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,060
whether the end results let's say the

00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,940
report that you get out of it later on

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:42,390
actually matches what you expect those

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,000
are very important to have in this case

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:48,990
they did have a few not that much so

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,329
that was a bummer then we also checked

00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:53,279
for randomized test because we found in

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:55,470
other projects that if you don't do use

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,570
randomized tests you often end up with

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:00,300
test cases that are biased towards one

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,410
particular area in your code and so even

00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,940
though you have one represent test

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,640
coverage you're not actually testing a

00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,860
one hundred percent of what the possible

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,600
entry data I could look like so you

00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,620
think you everything is correct but it's

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,600
not necessarily so right so that's what

00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,880
you can do in terms of code metrics or

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,459
by just looking at numbers next was this

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:25,230
kokomo model that we basically read up

00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:27,149
on wikipedia so this is it's very old

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,870
model it's I think it's from the 70s or

00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:34,770
80s it's it's used to to assign the

00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:36,829
value to a give an estimate for how much

00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:39,570
time you'd have to spend to write code

00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:41,610
the own traveler you enter is basically

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,020
lines of code and then you have to

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,970
choose one of these models of course

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,459
nowadays most projects or organic

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:50,930
projects in the sense of kokomo so you

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:53,540
have four small teams agile process and

00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:56,070
so there's nothing much to decide there

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:58,020
then you get these very simple formulas

00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:59,760
here with a few parameters too small

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,760
ABCD our parameters

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,880
those are predefined by the model so you

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,950
just look them up on Wikipedia use them

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,870
for their particular organic project

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,660
category that you want to use and then

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:15,300
you have to use this adjustment factor

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,340
to accommodate for the efficiency of

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,910
different languages and what we found is

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,760
that Wikipedia recommends 0.92 1.4 for

00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:25,440
Java and C well the numbers that came

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,440
out of this did not really match reality

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,660
so we had to use a different factors so

00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,790
we used point 5 for this which kind of

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,760
indicates as that sort of like a side

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,830
result from this whole thing that python

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:47,130
is in fact more efficient than Java and

00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:49,290
C as if we didn't know right so what do

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,790
you then get you get development time

00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:53,610
and then you have to look at your

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,990
development team the number of senior

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,570
developers and regular developers that

00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,860
you want to put on that team the how

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,540
much money you have to spend for them

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,590
and then you get the value and that's

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,300
your your estimate and you do the same

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:08,070
thing for the effort model except that

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,660
you don't use some formula for this you

00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:14,180
sit down with the project manager of

00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:17,670
that particular product and ask them ask

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:19,770
the company how much time they took to

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,380
to write this thing how many developers

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:24,360
they use and what problems they had and

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:31,310
then use that at input for this formula

00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:34,500
and you get to similar value right so

00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:38,850
next comes the somatic part which is add

00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:40,560
value so you have these numbers and then

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,090
you go through this list of soft factors

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,280
that you have and you add some

00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:47,010
percentage or you remove some percentage

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,160
from the value depending on what you

00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:54,000
think is good quality work or good

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,540
quality design and you factor in risks

00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,380
extensibility maintainability various

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,180
costs that you you see in the not in a

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,800
questionnaire that you did you add the

00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:07,380
risk buffering in the end you come up

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,600
with something that you can actually use

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,980
in your calculation so you take those

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,180
two models

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:14,820
he just took a pragmatic approach

00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,949
because we didn't know better so we use

00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:19,139
Kokomo model the the value that came out

00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:22,769
of that we use the effort model and just

00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:24,600
use the average then we added the value

00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:27,810
the added value factor in that

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:30,510
particular case came out to something

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:35,579
like seventy five percent more than what

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:37,500
the value from the models was which is a

00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,630
good sign by the way I mean they really

00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,959
did a good job though and then you come

00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:45,019
up with a final estimate right and then

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,360
in that particular case they also had

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,920
valuable data in that company which is

00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,290
something that you not necessarily

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,930
happen in startups but I mean if a syrup

00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:56,760
has worked for if a number of years then

00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,649
they have usually gathered some data and

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,410
you need to kind advantage to that as

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:04,199
well now for that we had not found any

00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:06,209
good model like the Kokomo one to use so

00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:07,529
if we could just use the effort model so

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:09,269
we basically sat down with them again

00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:12,449
try to figure out how much time it took

00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:16,170
them how much they had to pay for those

00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:17,699
experts to to gather that data and then

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,990
we had an estimate as well and we added

00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:21,329
everything together and then we had a

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,600
final value to give to the big company

00:14:21,329 --> 00:14:28,889
to then use as estimate now the next

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,470
specialist make or buy for doing that

00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:33,000
you have to basically try to create a

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,100
new company that that's exactly the same

00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,750
thing I mean I'm just leaving aside all

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,089
the patent and infringement and stuff

00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,459
just for me big company you know and

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:47,430
small company so big camping you can do

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:49,680
this it's more you can so right so what

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,990
you have to address you have to recreate

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,480
all the products all the data you have

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,790
to get the experts in which is usually

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,959
one of the most difficult parts and then

00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,610
of course you have to work and get the

00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:01,980
same market share in order to be able to

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,649
compare those two companies so all these

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,360
costs especially the marketing stuff

00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,850
that costs a lot so that's a business

00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:13,550
side so we did not do that so we just

00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:16,440
focus on the IT side and so you need to

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:18,960
see how much is how much money you would

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,180
have to put in as let's say you're

00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,770
software sharp like we are how much

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,780
effort you would have to put in to

00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:27,840
basically rebuild everything that they

00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,480
did and you'd also also have to then

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,890
look at how to recreate the data which

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,690
is not necessarily something that you do

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:35,340
as a software shot but at least you have

00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,020
to provide some advice on how to do this

00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,690
and then you have an offer for

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,880
rebuilding everything and then you put

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,800
everything together give it to them and

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:49,640
they decide and in this case I decided

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:54,440
not to buy so for them the analysis was

00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:58,350
maybe not exactly what they wanted but I

00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:02,010
think in the end it's it's a outcome was

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,960
good for everyone so how can you add

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,350
value to your startup well basically

00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:10,020
it's just all I've just said and you

00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,840
work on all these different factors and

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,430
improve them and it's not really that

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,110
hard I mean you just write you need to

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:19,560
write good code it has needs to have a

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:21,210
good structure complexity the complexity

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,190
should be low the structure should be

00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:27,150
rightfully better to use more modules

00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:28,620
than larger ones you would you need to

00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,890
have everything as flexible as possible

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:35,250
when you designed the whole product it

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,930
needs to be extensible because usually

00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,270
you want to the big company wants to

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,190
enter new markets which small company

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,610
has not thought about so you need to be

00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,890
flexible at that end and then of course

00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,220
you need to invest into things like data

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,170
structures like algorithms for example

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,360
yujin for the algorithms you can have

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,750
lots of books from CS you can use you

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,210
don't have to always have to use the

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:03,210
naive algorithms for everything which

00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:05,160
many companies do plus there's one

00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:08,070
important thing on the IT silence for

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,160
reducing risks by not depending too much

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:13,050
on third party packages because you

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,910
don't have that much control over them

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:18,000
even though they might be were very high

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,850
quality if your company is not capable

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,310
of maintaining such a third party

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:27,449
package in case for example the author

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:32,220
just goes away or just something else or

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:36,559
I don't see the project stops then you

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:48,750
have a futurist there right and that's

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:50,039
all I wanted to say thank you okay said

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,269
we have any questions I've got loads of

00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,320
questions so I hope you have the same

00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:56,940
ones that I have in my head because

00:17:52,320 --> 00:18:00,539
that'll help there you go yeah I wanted

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:04,070
to ask about about this rod on to lure

00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:07,470
this automatic check on the code quality

00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,000
isn't there usually the danger that that

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,549
you can play a game with it that you

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,440
optimize for the tool and not for actual

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:18,179
better code how reliable is this read on

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,740
if somebody tells me Oh tomorrow there

00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,750
will be due diligence just do some

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,320
makeup to the code so that the tool

00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:27,510
gives a better value is that possible

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,980
I'm quite sure it is possible yes but

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,690
the company in that case did not know

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,730
about this tool and we gave it to them

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,080
and said tomorrow we need the output so

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,929
they did not really have a chance of

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,149
manipulating anything so what we did in

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,370
that case is we took the output of radon

00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:44,070
and of course you get for it gives you

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,409
the outputs per module and then you look

00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:48,809
at the modules that look a bit like so

00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:53,010
you have a high complexity or have a low

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:54,539
maintainability and then you just check

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:57,720
those check the code of those and

00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:01,049
analyze why why the raid on to gives

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,360
that readings afterwards so of course

00:19:01,049 --> 00:19:05,909
you have to do some some code review as

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,470
well as part of that but we simply did

00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:08,909
not have time to read all the code base

00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,649
so you know if you do give them the code

00:19:08,909 --> 00:19:12,960
base that has a few hundred thousand

00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:18,299
lines of code then there's no way to do

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,769
with that fast more questions gentlemen

00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,769
it back on the right there is on

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:29,820
hello so did you look at any other

00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,520
alternatives to the Kokomo model which

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,070
seemed to use lines of code as as

00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,270
perhaps the starting point for measuring

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,400
things what are the ways could you

00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:40,670
measure measure what are the signals

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,270
from code could you use to measure the

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:46,680
value the signals from code or basically

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,350
what we did you were measuring lines of

00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,200
code weren't you that's how cook yes the

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:54,210
model works so and Andy the value that

00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,860
we get out of Kokomo was so much higher

00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:00,360
than the value that we estimated and the

00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,730
value that we got off the out of the

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,910
effort model that we simply had to use a

00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:08,130
different factor for that right okay it

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:11,010
just it reminded me of a musical example

00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,230
where the BBC used to pay arrangers by

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,300
bar and that was just an arbitrary

00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,530
measure and so the arrangers figure this

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,660
out very quickly that if they wrote

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,160
everything in 24 they got twice as much

00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,380
money because there was twice as many

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,350
bars and so there's a way you could gain

00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,490
this because if you understand what the

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,990
thing is that you're measuring again

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,460
it's very similar to the question we

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,550
just had before you could gain these

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:33,510
things but you wants it that I guess

00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:35,670
when you said that you didn't tell them

00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:37,320
that you're coming yeah I mean of course

00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,180
you look at the code and then you see

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,130
these things right so I mean if you see

00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:43,320
that someone's I don't have been been

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:45,690
adding lots and lots of dummy lines to

00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,880
the code and just to get more lines of

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,330
code to make it look like more valuable

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:57,090
then of course you will detect that yeah

00:20:51,330 --> 00:21:02,730
so of course sorry hi okay nice to hear

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:06,330
you hello you mentioned the risk buffer

00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:09,510
in your talk and what well you is

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:11,490
appropriate in your opinion this was

00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,320
hard to say I mean in our case for

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:16,320
example we were not able to review all

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,570
the code that they had so we just had we

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,890
did not even had a chance to look at all

00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:22,320
the components that they had in their

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:23,970
code so we just look at the main the

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,100
central kind of component that had all

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:27,360
the the interesting bits in it but we

00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,750
did not look at all the other components

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,670
that were

00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,790
stuck on the side that did some UI stuff

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:36,220
so we knew that we were only covering

00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:38,770
say maybe twenty percent of what they

00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,720
actually wrote in their code and based

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:44,950
on those twenty percent we kind of had

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,260
to interpolate than the rest the quality

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:49,660
of the rest and so that's what we use

00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,540
for the risk butter so the risk

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:55,960
butterworth was fairly sizable in that

00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:59,920
case so and at what number did you I

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:08,290
can't tell your luggage ready two more

00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:10,300
questions yeah um did you continue

00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,950
tracking the company to see whether your

00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,000
valuation was correct or did you have

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,480
any other way of knowing whether you'd

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,250
valuation was correct or close tickling

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,690
well we know that the big company did

00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,130
not buy the small company and that

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,140
they're thinking about actually doing it

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,840
themselves so they on the make or buy

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:27,700
they're actually more on the make side

00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,520
but they're still discussing that big

00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,520
companies take longer in these things

00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:39,130
what was the effort of the reviewer did

00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:43,270
you spend weeks of tens of people all

00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:47,080
the days no no no we had we didn't have

00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:51,100
much time we had something like two or

00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:54,160
three weeks like I just said and so we

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:57,130
had 11 full-day meeting with them asking

00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,990
all these questions also doing the part

00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:00,430
of the review you could say that of

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,530
course I did not give us the source code

00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:05,290
so we just had we had to sit there and

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,380
you just look at it and so we don't have

00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:10,900
that much information from them so we

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:15,280
had to base everything on that kind of

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:17,980
input more questions oh okay that's not

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,020
ideal just to save it but we simply I

00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,050
mean we were told that we have to give

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:24,850
them an answer the big company an answer

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:26,980
within those three weeks and that was

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:28,900
all we had so we needed to come up with

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:32,050
something that made sense and and so

00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,280
basically that's what we did so as I

00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:36,340
said in the beginning this is not

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,429
necessarily is this not a how you should

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:41,470
do it right this is just how we did it

00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:42,260
and and if the numbers that came out

00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:47,620
that did

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:50,740
sense hi so first thanks for the talk

00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:53,300
from what I understand you basically

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:56,090
evaluated a company based on their

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:59,360
repository which is outside interesting

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:02,090
but I would also argue that perhaps the

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,750
biggest weight in the company valuation

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:09,470
is the developer team or the company

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:12,350
structure their processes that were

00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:14,960
created out of various needs and so on

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:18,770
so I would be interested in how did you

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,370
approach to measure these kinds of it

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,140
saves more soft things well we we did

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:26,570
not have a look at the business side of

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,600
things because we had a different part

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,970
of the project doing that so they had to

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,470
become the company had had experts for

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,710
doing these things for analyzing the

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:38,060
numbers and analyzing the team all we

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,470
could do is we could tell them whether

00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,030
we have the impressions they have good

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,830
developers or not a good software

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,590
designers because that's our expertise

00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:47,180
and so we were not we're not experts on

00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:50,510
our business processes so we cannot

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:52,400
really put a value to that so what we

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:55,070
did to is we told the the business side

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,020
what we think about their their team

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,540
skills and we told them about the risks

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,560
that we found in the in the code base

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,300
and in the structure of their systems

00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:10,760
but that was basically it about the

00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:13,910
business side of things so it seems like

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,280
the very common thread in both talk and

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,570
and your answers is you were under a lot

00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,730
of pressure and you made certain

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:22,730
decisions just based basically because

00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,770
of that now let's say you remove all the

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:26,120
pressure you have as long as you want

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,980
like the big company comes in and tells

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,540
you take as long as you want have as

00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,040
many people as you want do whatever you

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,430
want with this what would you have done

00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:37,250
differently what would you have maybe

00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:41,180
not done or maybe done more thoroughly

00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:43,520
from the process well I think we would

00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:49,040
have done more research on this whole

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:52,070
valuation approach I mean we basically

00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:56,300
just sad this Kokomo model which

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,620
came up on wikipedia we use that there

00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,210
were also some people in the company you

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:01,340
wanted to use that model so they

00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,820
obviously found it and found it useful

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,770
so we kind of made sense to use that we

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,420
wouldn't have put more energy into that

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,610
we would have had more interviews with

00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,880
the team members we would have done more

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:16,340
code reviews we would have had access to

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,500
the actual all the systems all the

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:23,450
components so not just looking at a part

00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:26,000
of it then I mean basically talking to

00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:28,130
people is very valuable we did not have

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,970
time for that we just talked to the

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:35,870
chief developers not the like the

00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:38,570
regular developers that they had we also

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,460
did not really have a much look into the

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,320
the development structure and how they

00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,050
work for example that is something that

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,880
we completely left out for example we

00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:49,160
would look at this how they do this

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,680
agile process how that works out for

00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,840
them whether it's sufficient for them or

00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,040
not this kind of thing because when

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:56,690
buying the company of course you're not

00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,970
just buying the product you also find

00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:03,890
the people and and of course people are

00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:05,750
usually very valuable but sometimes you

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,890
need to restructure things to make them

00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,390
more efficient because you're not

00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,850
necessarily buying the most efficient

00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,450
process their development process I mean

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,550
not business process okay I can't resist

00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,900
asking a question myself and you said

00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,160
you split it very clearly between like

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,210
the business decisions were for the

00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,150
business and yours were just the

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,710
technical ones but it occurs to me that

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:28,280
some of the value you get from software

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,960
isn't down to like how complex it is or

00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:32,810
how much effort you put into making it

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,220
but it's like the intellectual property

00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,170
or finding the correct solution you know

00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,640
like it took 20 years for someone to

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,470
eventually come up with Tim sort as

00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,580
being the like you know heuristic

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:42,590
algorithm that's going to be really good

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:43,760
for sorting lists but actually it's only

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:45,560
eight lines of koden if you wanted to

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,180
reimplement it and you knew which one

00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,520
you were doing wouldn't take long so did

00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:51,560
you have any way of kind of evaluating

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,240
or measuring these guys have come up

00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,710
with a really good solution to this and

00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,390
trying to come up with it again from

00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:58,370
scratch going through all the wrong

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:00,440
solutions would take ages or cost lots

00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:01,760
of money yes yes we in that interview

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,770
session that we did we have

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,630
them basically explained to us how they

00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:09,140
how they do this how what the solution

00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:12,020
looks like and then we found that they

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,720
were doing a had a kind of clever way of

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:18,440
doing things not necessarily the most

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:23,810
clever way of doing things so there was

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:26,570
some some there was some basis for

00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,280
improvement there you can see that where

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,260
to improve things so that was that was

00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,520
something that we found was positive so

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,870
that you can actually make it work

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,060
better and scare better but we and we've

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:41,390
taken that into those added values as

00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:43,040
percentage so they had we found that

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,950
they had reasonably good algorithms for

00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,870
everything but actually putting a value

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:49,580
to what what you're saying is more or

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:51,590
less putting a value to say something

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,450
like a patent or something like the

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:57,320
mechanism that you come up with an idea

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,430
and that we did not do any more

00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,540
questions I know there's one at the

00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,190
front from someone who's already asked

00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:03,080
two questions so we have time for one

00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,840
more if someone hasn't spoken up yet

00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,610
they can have a burning question

00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,680
answered otherwise it's a familiar

00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:15,680
sounding voice but we're very glad to

00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:20,150
have it and I not sure if I may be

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:22,760
missed it but I is genoqs even allowed

00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,920
to make an offer to the big company

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,280
because you gained a lot of inside

00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:30,680
knowledge isn't that cheating if if you

00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:32,480
redo the project now after extracting

00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,670
all the information from me well if big

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,560
company asked us of course we can I mean

00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:39,920
like I just said I mean this big empty

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,540
in small company so yes of course you do

00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,250
have these issues that you cannot take

00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:47,000
away the international property of the

00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:48,650
small company and just and just redo

00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,350
everything but that's not really our

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,330
decision right if they want it like that

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,890
and they asked us to do it maybe a

00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,470
little differently so that you don't

00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,150
have these issues of course be companies

00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,030
lots of lawyers and legal departments

00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,850
and everything so they can make it work

00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:06,110
which is not necessarily nice but I mean

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:07,840
the companies are not necessary nice

00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:09,920
right

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,750
good well that takes us to quarter to

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,950
and time for our last breaks the next

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,060
thing on the schedule is lightning talks

00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,060
