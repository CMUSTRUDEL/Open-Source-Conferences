This talk is based on the speaker's experience running a Python
focused software company for more than 15 years and a recent
consulting project to support the valuation of a Python startup
company in the due diligence phase.

For the valuation we had to come up with metrics, a catalog of
criteria analyzing risks, potential and benefits of the startup's
solution, as well as an estimate for how much effort it would take to
reimplement the solution from scratch.

In the talk, I am going to show the metrics we used, how they can be
applied to Python code, the importance of addressing risk factors,
well designed code and data(base) structures.

By following some of the advice from this talk, you should be able to
improve the valuation of your startup or consulting business in
preparation for investment rounds or an acquisition.
