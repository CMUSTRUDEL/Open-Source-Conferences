A modern application has a lot of passwords and keys floating around.
Encryptions keys, database passwords, and API credentials; often typed
in to text files and forgotten. Fortunately a new wave of tools are
emerging to help manage, update, and audit these secrets. Come learn
how to avoid being the next TechCrunch headline.

-----

Secrets come in many forms, passwords, keys, tokens. All crucial for
the operation of an application, but each dangerous in its own way. In
the past, many of us have pasted those secrets in to a text file and
moved on, but in a world of config automation and ephemeral
microservices these patterns are leaving our data at greater risk than
ever before.

New tools, products, and libraries are being released all the time to
try to cope with this massive rise in threats, both new and old-but-
ignored. This talk will cover the major types of secrets in a normal
web application, how to model their security properties, what tools
are best for each situation, and how to use them with major web
frameworks.
