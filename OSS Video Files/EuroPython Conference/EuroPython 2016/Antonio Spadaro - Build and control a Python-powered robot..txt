During this talk you will see how to make a robot able to recognize
people with a Raspberry Pi as main board and Python as language. The
talk will cover the hardware and modules, discuss briefly the
alternatives, and finally show a live demo.

-----

The robot uses two main modules:

 - **OpenCV** (_Open Source Computer Vision Library_), an open-source
library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.
Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps
on the web or through advanced robotics.

 - **gpiozero**, a simple interface to everyday GPIO components used
with Raspberry Pi.

The first is used to recognize the people and the object; the second
to control the robot.
