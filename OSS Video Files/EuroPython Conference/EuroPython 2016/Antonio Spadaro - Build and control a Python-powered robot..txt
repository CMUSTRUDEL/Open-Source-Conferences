	Antonio Spadaro - Build and control a Python-powered robot.

During this talk you will see how to make a robot able to recognize
people with a Raspberry Pi as main board and Python as language. The
talk will cover the hardware and modules, discuss briefly the
alternatives, and finally show a live demo.

-----

The robot uses two main modules:

 - **OpenCV** (_Open Source Computer Vision Library_), an open-source
library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.
Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps
on the web or through advanced robotics.

 - **gpiozero**, a simple interface to everyday GPIO components used
with Raspberry Pi.

The first is used to recognize the people and the object; the second
to control the robot.

and he's going to power so happy camera

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:13,810
abuse for DC

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:21,740
- motor drivers for control the motor DC

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:24,400
- servo motors an ultrasound sensor and

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,400
a power bank

00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:27,980
they become a descender the data for a

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:36,980
raspberry peach tree the servomotor the

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:47,019
data and control the motor for a PC

00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:51,590
control all motors the software is a

00:03:47,019 --> 00:04:02,110
socket server on your therapy camera

00:03:51,590 --> 00:04:09,220
sockets are very qe4 the control of the

00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:12,709
robot and for receive the frame of him

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:23,419
and the surface I will command the motor

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:26,990
the motors servo motors the camera and

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:31,760
directly it to control the servo motors

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:38,780
found a camera and the motors from the

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:43,700
ultrasonic sensor the communication

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:49,370
protocol user D is Wi-Fi but why Wi-Fi

00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:51,150
find or not I use Bluetooth Wi-Fi so

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:57,260
more speed

00:04:51,150 --> 00:05:03,960
there is a small range of distance and

00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:12,479
we can connect two more days so we can

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:15,440
now send a quality image a long time I

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,440
can't

00:06:38,180 --> 00:09:00,540
and people driving because they start to

00:08:48,890 --> 00:09:05,000
try to renew the similarity from this is

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,000
the first performance on our very Petri

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:45,800
face on major we eat to 0 32 seconds for

00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:45,800
20,000 for the image it will be

00:09:59,759 --> 00:11:36,309
we know the price is that is more small

00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:44,789
very small because if we take an Arduino

00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:44,789
we insert Wi-Fi mode camera mode

00:11:56,740 --> 00:13:21,800
so the center on frame from the therapy

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:29,560
- crying - I use another server problem

00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:36,050
a little problem resolution resolution

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:42,850
have big frame delay if we we want to

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:51,640
send we want to say in the 60,000 44

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:56,839
4,000 Diggity image we can video for it

00:13:51,640 --> 00:14:01,660
but the grayscale ISM is the motor speed

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,660
so if we want

00:14:22,040 --> 00:15:03,930
but when we start the robot to therapy

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:10,350
make not photo our highest bottom and

00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:43,920
they're crying to connect to their Wi-Fi

00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:46,520
hotspot and interconnection it is more

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,520
speed

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:11,360
with the two servo motors we will move

00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,360
the camera we move the camera I

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,220
okay

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:42,549
we reserved a theme this is the power

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:45,120
going to touch power their authority and

00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:45,120
the motors

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,909
okay now it

00:18:43,390 --> 00:19:11,890
control it is PC who can be can be see

00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:11,890
now can see I know Wi-Fi or robot

00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:41,070
okay now I'm connected go for the robot

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:39,380
we can be we can control simple joystick

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:38,460
now eat I can see the output of the

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,460
camera

00:23:52,190 --> 00:24:04,670
okay elementary - he's after they're not

00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:08,120
the minimum quality we have easily why

00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:12,940
turn blanks it is more speed but like a

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,940
black we can

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:18,210
