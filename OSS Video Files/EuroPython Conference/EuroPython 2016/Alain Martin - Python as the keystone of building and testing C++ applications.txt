This talk explains how Abletonâ€™s developers use Python to build and
test C, C++ and Objective-C code. Our "build-system" is a collection
of Python scripts that simplify our workflows, and help us write
better software. The top-level scripts share a common design which
makes them easy to use, maintain and extend. This talk describes the
essence of that design, so you can apply it to your own project.

At Ableton, we make [Live][1], [Push][2] and [Link][3], unique
software and hardware for music creation and performance. Live is a
C++ desktop application built from a 15-year old code base. Push is an
instrument embedding a multicolor display which renders a [Qt
Quick][4] scene powered by [Qt][5]. Link is a technology that keeps
music devices in time and is available to app developers as
[LinkKit][6], an iOS SDK. "But what does all that have to do with
Python?", you might ask.

This talk answers that question by explaining how our developers use
Python to build and test C, C++ and Objective-C source code. Based on
[GYP][7], what we call "build-system" is a collection of Python
scripts that simplify our workflows, and help us write better
software. The three top-level scripts, "configure.py", "build.py" and
"run.py", share a common design which makes them easy to use by
developers, as well as easy to maintain and extend. This talk
describes the essence of that design, so you can apply it to your own
project.
