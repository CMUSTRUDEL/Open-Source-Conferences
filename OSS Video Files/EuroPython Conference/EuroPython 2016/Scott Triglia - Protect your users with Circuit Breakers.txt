Failures are the bane of scaling a modern web service and can cause
serious pain for end users! Lucky for us, there are techniques that
can help protect your product and handle failures in subsystems
gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth, the
Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for
keeping all our users safe. We will be focusing on several real-world
problems and options for how to implement your circuit breaker setup
in nice, readable python code.

The inevitability of failures is the bane of scaling any modern web
service and can cause serious pain for end users! Lucky for us, there
are techniques that can help protect your product handle failures in
subsystems gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth,
the Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for
keeping our users safe.

We will be focusing on several real-world problems and how they can be
addressed by circuit breakers. You should expect to leave the talk
with details on simple circuit breakers as well as understanding how
they can be adapted for more complex situations. We’ll also discuss
some options for how to implement your circuit breaker in readable
python.


**Contrived FAQ time!**

**I don’t know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**
Definitely! We’re going to start from scratch and work our way up.
Only requirement is basic familiarity with backend services receiving
and making HTTP requests.

**I totally know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**
Definitely! After the intro, the main meat of the talk will be working
through a series of more advanced situations and talking about how we
can alter the basic circuit breaker setup to address them.

**I want real-world advice, not made up hypotheticals!**
Well that’s not really a question, but you’ll be happy to know that
the examples we’ll discuss come straight from my experience at Yelp.
They should be very realistic and broadly applicable.
