Optimization in Python (also known as mathematical programming) can be
performed by minimization (or maximization) of an objective function
within a model that can include discrete variables subject to a set of
constrains. At this talk, chemical engineering students of the
University of Alicante will introduce the audience to the
possibilities of optimization, presenting Pyomo and showing real world
examples such as how to improve your diet and save money at fast food
restaurants.

-----

Process optimization in industry has become essential in order to
maximize the resources available and reduce energy consumption.
Optimization problems become interesting when dealing with
restrictions (linear or nonlinear) and integer variables (modeling the
discrete decisions). Python ecosystem presents different libraries to
solve optimization problems, some of them are CVXOpt, CVXPy, PulP,
OpenOpt, or Pyomo.
Among them, Pyomo results interesting because:

- It can be used for Mathematical modeling in Python similarly to AMPL
(and GAMS)
- It communicates with the main solvers used in this field such as
GLPK, Gurobi, CPLEX, CBC and PICO
- It's free and open source Python library (BSD license), being
developed by Sandia National Laboratories, USA.
- It supports Python 3 and it is easy to install.

The talk will be divided in three parts:

1. _Introduction to Mathematical Programming/Optimization (15 min):_
visual introduction to optimization concepts including restrictions
and non linearties (linear Programming, Nonlinear Programming, ILP,
MIP, MINLP).

2. _Introduction to the Pyomo sintax and a quick note for the
installation (20 min):_ showing how to improve their diet and save
money when ordering food in fast food restaurants.

3. _Optimization problems in engineering (10 min):_ showing more
advanced optimization examples that include decision variables.

welcome all here I have Danielle and

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:08,220
through three are with me on how to

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:16,980
improve your diet and save money with

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:21,480
Python give them some applause hi

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,670
everyone um my name is Maria he is

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,859
Danielle we are both students from the

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,949
University of Alicante and we are both

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,740
chemical engineering students so will

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,260
not program ass so if you see something

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,809
in a coat feel free to send a pull

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,079
request at the top and that's another

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:43,559
thing you can't find a word mentation

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,520
and notebooks in orgy tab which i will

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:52,199
post on Twitter later and something

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,600
about us we are both active members of

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,460
ketchum which is no profit organization

00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,629
by our university and well something

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,720
maybe about the personalities he is in

00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:10,320
love with interactive widgets and she

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:14,310
loves them I actually don't like them so

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,850
much and well we are programmed in

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:22,170
science 2015 so we are beginners in this

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,450
and something about the talk and we are

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,240
technical engineers and we love reactors

00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:30,030
and distillation columns but I don't

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,920
think you're much chemical engineer so

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,799
maybe use will not be interesting for

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,369
you so we're thinking what is everything

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,979
everyone of us eat and well every one of

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:44,549
us wants to eat the most but pay the

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,250
minimums money so but all of us have the

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,250
objective now it's summer so we are

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,930
going to fit and be healthy so we are

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,350
going to show you how you can optimize

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,890
ate your food with a minimum cost but

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,280
having the nutritional concerns that you

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,010
want to have

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,350
and well now I'm going to let you daniel

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:08,229
is going to tell you something more

00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,860
about the theory of this optimization

00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:10,860
problem

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:28,580
thank you for me there are no indebted

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:32,790
witches here so don't be afraid and

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:36,390
optimization deals we find a minimum or

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,820
a maximum or series of a given function

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,640
and we are going to see some concept

00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:45,720
using their diet problem and this

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,750
problem was known in the early 40s or

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:51,840
when they you assuming I wanted to

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:58,200
minimize the cost of food and give the

00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:02,090
shoulders balanced diet eighth wonder

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,660
Stan this is better I give you are an

00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:10,200
example imagine we move the problem the

00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,650
diet program to the present time and at

00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:20,520
this day is a common go to a fast-food

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:25,380
establishment 22 to treat and each color

00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:30,570
and we want a cheaper meat and of course

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:34,110
we want a healthy man so this is our

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:36,690
problem and we do to the system do can

00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,560
choose some products like fries like

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:43,290
hamburgers and these are available

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,760
naming as eggs in our mathematical

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:52,459
problem and you know its product half a

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:55,440
price and the total price is the

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,660
multiplication of all position by this

00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,340
variable and little summation of all

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:06,819
them is our final cause now we want to

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,900
do is minimize this cost subject to ax

00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:12,639
constraints and nutritional constraint

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,069
so this is all mathematical problem and

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:20,380
we are going to optimize this using a

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:23,830
Python but first we have to see some

00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,139
concert about all alpha T musician and I

00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,630
with my professors from me at the very

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:33,130
beginning and i'm going to show you in

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:35,770
10 minutes so first what is a linear

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,690
function and another function that you

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:42,009
can see here this is a linear function

00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:44,919
its crystalline yes and well this is a

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:54,250
nonlinear function you see it's not a

00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:56,199
lane okay thank you do come from OD you

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,020
can perform this in three dimension this

00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:05,740
is a plane and knowing our function look

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:09,610
like this in three dimensions well a

00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:11,530
smooth person known as smooth if you

00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:13,930
have something like this this is a

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:17,020
function where you can calculate the

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,680
tangent in all the point of this domain

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:24,490
so this mean that is ISA is most

00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,680
function great and for example in the

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,409
vertex of the solar function you cannot

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,090
calculate the tangent so this is unknown

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:38,800
as smooth a function it is important a

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:41,349
little and also in 3d in three

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,900
dimension this is a a smooth function

00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:49,060
and as you can see also that is this is

00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:51,039
unknown a smooth function and we need to

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,340
measure use the gradient of the game

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:57,880
function to solve the problem and you

00:05:54,340 --> 00:06:00,340
can invoke cases this value is not given

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,800
so you have to calculate it numerically

00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:05,200
so is you have family function this is

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,660
so complicated and

00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:11,610
you not be sure that don't have a

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:16,270
mistake so to automate we prefer the

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:21,730
ring that graph the function so known as

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:26,470
if function well if you have some like

00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:29,740
this is a convex function when the

00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:32,470
tangent in a point is completely recent

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,400
that you could have a minimum in this

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,290
case you only have one point one point

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,610
is the lowest point so it's a robot

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:45,310
minimum and of course if you have more

00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,410
than one point have the recent engine to

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:50,200
have you have more than one minimum in

00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,670
this case you have the lowest value for

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,370
the function is the global minimum and

00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:58,060
you have for them minimum that are they

00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:03,250
look at anyone this is a so important

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:05,650
and why is this important well when you

00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,870
are solving this type of problem dude on

00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:11,530
actually know the value of all the point

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:15,580
in your angel function so it's like you

00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:17,560
are in a fog cover mountain and you only

00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:20,650
have the information of the new area

00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:25,600
region so it could be possible that is

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:28,570
the phone going out well do it could be

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:35,380
that you are not in the global point in

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:39,910
a global optimum well and what is a

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,950
convex and no conversation this is a

00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:45,790
convex function imagine if you choose

00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:48,010
any two points in the graph and and you

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:52,150
trace arsenal line between these two

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:53,830
point is the graph is always the down

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:57,430
the segment you have her come backs

00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:58,650
function if not you have a non-convex

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,889
function

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:08,940
it's easy and also in three dimension

00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:12,240
complex and long conversation today so

00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:16,380
this is a important chata what is a

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,650
constraint a well-trained is a function

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,660
that limit your searches place to find a

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,220
minimum imagine we have this function

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,500
this is I had to control the function

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:30,180
and the lowest point is the black toy in

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:33,599
the global minimum if we have not any

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,770
constraint a wilting point is the black

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,760
bar in the global minimum okay so we can

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:44,279
have different type of constraint like

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,910
this is a quality constraint that's mean

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,730
that the optimum point must be inside

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,330
our restrictions so the social for this

00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:57,750
problem is in the red point this is the

00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:00,660
optimum and as you can see is a a clear

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:04,920
point to the lower minimum inside this

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:08,940
restriction you can have inequality

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:13,050
constraints that allows you to search

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:15,150
your optimum point over the first issue

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,089
or under the restitution in this case

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:22,589
you can say you can share your ottoman

00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:25,560
point over the inequality constraint and

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,750
of course yeah right the optimum point

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:32,279
is the global minimum of the function so

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:34,560
it's a fantastic and you can have the

00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:37,910
other case you are only allowed to

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,700
church the Ottoman point under the

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,960
constraint so your solution is this red

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,520
point

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:50,850
you can ask me well it's a it's a little

00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:53,490
far of the robot minimum yeah but this

00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:57,600
is your problem and this is the better

00:09:53,490 --> 00:10:00,840
solution for this case because you are a

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,090
constraint and this is so important of

00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:09,330
course you have a more than one a

00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:12,960
constraint you can perform a little such

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:15,260
a space to find the minimum and as you

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:21,990
can see the red point is in order prime

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:25,440
right of course this region that you

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:29,310
find is a concern should be a convex

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,610
region to be sure you are in a global

00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:35,280
optimum point because if you have some

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,920
legs did you and never could be sure you

00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:42,060
are in a global optimum you only can

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,860
shoot the solution is a local minimum or

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:49,140
a local maximum but not the best

00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:51,840
solution well most of the figure and

00:10:49,140 --> 00:11:00,380
speed from reversing and cyclic sure

00:10:51,840 --> 00:11:04,110
thank you girl raccoons well attending

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:07,860
to these the two musician problem can be

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,320
divided by using these ideas if you pay

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,250
attention of your editing function as

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:18,120
your attention you can ask well it's a

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:21,120
linear it's a nonlinear and are we have

00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,590
a decision variables that means that you

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:30,210
can do a a chance for example I only

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:34,530
want a vegetarian meaning or not it's

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:38,010
like 1 or 0 they're half my problem

00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:40,410
binary variable yes or no so we can have

00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,120
in a programming problem mix interval

00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,220
linear programming problems and

00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,500
nonlinear programming problem and the

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,890
most difficult mix it in Turin nonlinear

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,830
programming problem and each one of

00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:54,050
these type of problem half

00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,630
may not worry seem to solve it for

00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:59,300
example i will use the simplex algorithm

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:03,560
to solve linear programming and it is

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:05,780
three so you wanted to be well an

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,450
optimization model can be defined

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:11,870
mathematically as follows this is our

00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:15,620
problem that I a problem and as you can

00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:18,200
see there are only letters and but don't

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:22,370
be afraid in Palermo this is know that

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,930
abstract model because we put the

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:30,830
position and other parameters externally

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:34,850
and this is a concrete model in Palermo

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:37,010
where you put explicity the value of the

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:44,110
parameter of other coefficient in the

00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:44,110
problem so now I'm going to change

00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:59,540
ok

00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:01,940
well the optimization problem could be

00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:05,209
solved through us servers I saw where

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:08,839
Lisa and the implementation of the mind

00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:11,959
algorithm so we before and some of these

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:14,360
so it could be that you so here for

00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:17,870
linear programming we can use the lpk

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:20,029
pulp now it's all for example for mixing

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,630
entering nonlinear programming we use

00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:30,050
barren and cheap legs Shiflett is

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:32,120
fantastic regularly and well we can use

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:35,449
this soul this service through an

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:39,019
algorithm throught algebraic and

00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:40,970
modeling language that sees a high-level

00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:46,510
computer then we did a support

00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:49,010
formulation and analysis of large

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:53,540
mathematical problem some of them are

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:55,220
unbell guns aim I'm of course IMO IMO is

00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:57,500
interesting because allows the

00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,709
formulation of algebra key model using

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,930
Python and this is great and it's

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:10,430
communicate with principal solvers even

00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:15,170
Nestor and why biome oh well why not by

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:19,459
remote yeah paramore is an open-source a

00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:23,449
has a server integration and has several

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:26,120
advantages over cotton my like it's a

00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:29,750
robe language has extensive

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:33,500
documentation rich set of a standard

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:36,440
libraries and more so why not payable

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,220
it's a good option so for assigned by mo

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,350
we have to thank for risk a known for

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:46,100
his help building the Condor is safe for

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:50,370
Palermo a fallacy is also in the inner

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:53,520
conference Thank You Horace

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:58,200
and for Italian do you only have to type

00:14:53,520 --> 00:15:01,350
this line code and you have to install

00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:03,240
the Soviet separately because they don't

00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:06,330
have to implement industries but it's

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,700
not a problem you want to install dlp

00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:12,500
care to solve phillippe prevent and

00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:15,150
mixing interlinear priming type this and

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:21,210
to solve nonlinear programming you can

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:23,850
use a pop type in the solid line and you

00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,589
can install some extra like nail server

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:26,760
there is the free internet by said

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:29,400
service for solving numerical

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,160
optimization problem and it's so

00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:37,830
interesting for more information click

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:41,370
the link and now I give the wall I don't

00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:45,560
know what to say to 30 that is going to

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,560
explain their the problem we perform

00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:59,649
and we are sorry for that much of theory

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,120
but if we don't show you that you will

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,000
not understand what I'm going to show

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,100
you now so I'm not going to I am now

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,829
going to show you the the practical part

00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:14,800
of this so now we're going to improve

00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:18,430
your diet and well or problem is that

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:22,300
like you then explained before but in we

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:25,750
have two cases the first cases we set or

00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:28,620
menu in from a fast food restaurant you

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:33,130
want and we want to minimize the coast

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:36,370
but eat the healthiest way so we have a

00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:40,180
lot of constraint we have to minimize a

00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:44,170
function option and well all that have

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:49,720
to be the optimum solution for us so how

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:52,180
i did this i actually am NOT good with

00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,730
guideline daily amount in this stuff but

00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:58,839
i was searching in internet and well I

00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:01,930
find a lot of data about the input of

00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:04,120
daily nutrients you should eat a day

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,669
what you can see here for different

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:10,600
woman man children that would you

00:17:06,669 --> 00:17:14,010
shooting today it's a little bit they

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:17,910
know if someone does that but well

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,920
and using this I have done the problem

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,339
I've solved that first we need to import

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:27,329
paloma you can say we are including

00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:29,150
everything but it's like it's convention

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:32,700
and pie-o-my so he does this because

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:37,130
it's like this and then I got the data

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,960
them I have to say the data it's not

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:43,530
totally real so everything what could be

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:47,340
real it's fiction and you will say here

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:50,490
is my data and we have I don't know if

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:55,080
they will let me show you but in this

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:57,510
data we have onions the costs and then

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,170
on that I will show you later if you

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:04,140
want we set or parameter we will be or

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:09,390
constraint values it means in this case

00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:11,700
we have calories sugar proteins and some

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:15,960
of this stuff and I have settled maximum

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:19,050
minimum values I want in my diet so

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,050
solving this problem first we need to

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:24,540
input the model this type of problem is

00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:28,500
an in linear problem and an abstract

00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:31,200
model so we said the set the sets of the

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,450
data i use to get the modeling and in

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,260
this case we have the products and the

00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:40,350
nutrients with their parameters which

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:43,560
are data with depends on the sets i have

00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:45,120
said before and we have caused nutrients

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,090
and a maximum and minimum of each

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:52,320
nutrients so which of course will

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:54,750
default 0 and infinite then we have

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,270
variables will be in this case the

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,180
number of servings what we're going to

00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:03,660
take or objective function a de minimis

00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:07,010
ice to coast of the food and it's the

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:09,900
normal structure of our object function

00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:12,510
or constraint with is there I think the

00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:16,500
most difficult part of the code because

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:17,720
you have to look what what you're going

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,850
to do and it's

00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,490
Leo will show you are more difficult

00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:25,010
problem like that and well this is very

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,100
easy we have maximum and minimum nothing

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:30,740
more and solving the problem that's what

00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:32,690
polymer gives here as a song as a

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,360
solution you see you have one solution

00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:37,010
which is great we have a function value

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,310
it means we have million resides across

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,590
two three six nine year olds and well he

00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:46,310
finished everything done and the

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,170
solution he does for us is this but it's

00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:52,580
not showing my solution i don't know one

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,890
and under it and what you don't see and

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,040
he gives you the answer it makes in this

00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,970
case we get you can eat one big mac and

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:04,190
you have Optimus aight you diet you see

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:10,100
that's everything flow means in one meal

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:12,470
of course because um yup but only the

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:17,690
hamburger you can't eat the fries only

00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:20,510
Hamburg um you have to say here you see

00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:25,340
that's a normal graph of what we've gone

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:27,470
Big Mac you see this black one is the

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,080
daily amount in one meal you should eat

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:35,200
but this type of food have a lot of salt

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:38,060
a lot of fat so well if you want to eat

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:44,960
healthy you go there and you'd obey kick

00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:47,630
it won't be great now i'm going to show

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,750
you something very different I like this

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:53,000
problem alert because I were thinking

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,390
what can do more with the diet problem

00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,700
and then we'll thing it will now we're

00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:01,400
going to do the opposite it means how

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:05,600
much calories are can eat in one meal

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:09,530
for old five euros and it was like wow I

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:11,730
go there and eat a lot saner well I do

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:16,960
that yeah this was

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:20,130
let's eat and well we dig the same we do

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,410
the import of pmo we get a day there

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,840
which you will not find that it's a dead

00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:30,070
link McDonald that I don't know what's

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:34,000
happened well and to solve that it's an

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:37,660
abstract model we said or sets or

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,880
parameters but in this time you say it's

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,740
not the nutrients we are going to set to

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,800
maximum minimum this time as the cost

00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,100
zero and the five heroes in this case or

00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:50,230
variables are the same and or objective

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,840
function now is the calories but remove

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:55,630
the maximum you see I am is very visual

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,670
and very easy you see there the sense

00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:59,170
when you want to minimize eyes you put

00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:01,990
them in his eyes and when you maximize

00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:06,400
put maximize its energy enough to do

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:09,400
anything more and well or constraint now

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,480
it will be on the cost and or solution

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:18,310
we got you see you can eat a warm meal

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:20,730
2690 kilocalories 45 euros so you eat

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:24,610
that what you should be then one day

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:28,480
what I think it's respectable 45 heroes

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:32,320
and the solution is this you should be

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,990
three hamburgers for one year 29 and one

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,410
package of grilled onion rings which

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,410
I've never seen

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:48,039
now I'm sorry for it we are chamaca

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,899
engineers and laugh reactors and

00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:51,549
distillation government so now you're

00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:55,450
going to see the problem we solve

00:22:51,549 --> 00:23:00,009
normally and well that's a problem or

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:02,470
example in this case and we saw chemical

00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:05,289
engineering chemical industry problems

00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:07,860
so we have tunes eight or ways to get a

00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:10,869
product and to minimize our

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:12,519
environmental impact because we deal

00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:15,309
with a lot of chemical products and

00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:19,960
something like that so to make it easy

00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:23,559
for you we have products which we can do

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:26,230
pass with a reactor to Philip product

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,259
which will be beer in this case and then

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:32,289
we can separate water from the alcohol

00:23:29,259 --> 00:23:35,950
with distillation and we'll get whiskey

00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:38,289
and water but we have conduit with two

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,450
types reactors we have but and

00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:43,269
continuous would mean to batch reactor

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:46,389
it's what you're doing home you put your

00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:49,289
water in and stop the reaction eat it

00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:52,720
and then put another boiling water on it

00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:55,029
continues and will be there how much

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,429
time you wanted and distillation the

00:23:55,029 --> 00:24:01,179
same you have a batch reactor which is

00:23:57,429 --> 00:24:05,259
Isis think it's on a Simpsons capital

00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:09,970
then yeah they explode that thing but

00:24:05,259 --> 00:24:13,629
you can do it in our in short times or a

00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:15,009
long time for continues and well that's

00:24:13,629 --> 00:24:18,549
not why i'm going to show you who have

00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:21,519
this superstructure we have anyone to

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:24,009
get it to be and then to see we have two

00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:27,279
ways to got it we have a reactor we have

00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:30,820
a lot of distillation columns and well

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,730
we get parameters to say us what we can

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:37,570
do with the minimum environmental impact

00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:39,910
and while we have a lot of reactions as

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:44,250
everyone is interested in you can

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:47,170
but I don't think he did want dad and

00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:48,760
here we'll have our interesting fact we

00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:50,800
have disjunction this is the first time

00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,490
you will see them disjunctions you have

00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:57,460
to imagine it as like two situations we

00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:00,580
have situation one which is when we have

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:03,850
situate one the coast and every product

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,980
will be this data but if this situation

00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,490
is not going to happen we have the other

00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:13,180
it mean everything is 0 so this part is

00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:16,390
not existing anymore and it's the heart

00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:18,640
is part deal with it on pmo which

00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:20,290
everyone is if everyone's interested you

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,050
can come to me outside and they will

00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:25,660
displaying you how to do it so now we

00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:28,450
are going to introduce binary variables

00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:32,170
which is everyone I think you know what

00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:36,610
binary variable is the 10 well its exist

00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:38,920
or its don't exist so optimizing or

00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:42,910
final objection you see this time it's

00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:47,170
not a lovely linear problem this time we

00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:49,600
have a real expression with everything

00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,940
Matt stuff and now i'm going to show you

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,210
the restaurants because the code is very

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:58,120
very long there's are the results what

00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,340
we should do so you see by only you can

00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,520
use it for everything to go to

00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:07,030
mcdonough's or to make your all reactor

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,640
at home and settle i don't know whiskey

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:13,390
beer what you want so you can use

00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:16,300
everything of this for your own choice

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:20,290
and last but not least i have to say it

00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:22,690
i mean i said before because we are

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:25,120
apart both part of Kachemak which is a

00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:26,860
nonprofit organization from the

00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,990
University of Alicante which encouraged

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,150
chemical engineers to use programming

00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:34,930
because we actually don't learn to

00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:37,590
program in all studies and well we have

00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:39,149
to think with what to say there's the

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,969
homepage

00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:45,989
and we have to sing a lot to or teachers

00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:49,139
Fran Navarro and ruin brief ammonia

00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:52,700
which are factors to justice and i hope

00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:52,700
you enjoyed to speak

00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,820
hi and I wanted to know if you know what

00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,270
are the methods for optimization that

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,510
are used inside PMO or any of the tools

00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,970
that you're calling from it like is it

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:30,480
iterative iterative way a sedan

00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:33,120
Newtonian is it a conjugate gradient

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,150
what kind of method of optimization is

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,690
done to arrive to the minimum does it

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:44,040
get people it's normally it's an

00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:47,010
iterative way so he tries every thing

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,960
and wants to change how the solution

00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:51,420
will fit everything but normally you

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,450
have seen a very simple problem but

00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,640
before I showed you you have I think 29

00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:58,740
equations you have to optimize I'd

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,850
because the solution needs to fit every

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,920
of them so sometimes it will be a good

00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:06,870
solution what you get but sometimes not

00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:10,980
so you have to play a little bit with

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:13,500
that we normally use gums and you will

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,070
see the code is on there too that they

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,330
give very similar but not the same

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:21,750
solution for you to the same problem

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,750
because every solar had his own stop I

00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,080
don't believe that is the answer also to

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,080
cushion

00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:39,140
yeah it's okay I can shut we won't be

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,000
thank you very much for the talk with

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,779
the optimization of calories for five

00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:53,340
heroes did you have any constraints as

00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:55,350
in non toxic level of salt or fat so can

00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,320
you survive those calories oh it's just

00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:02,070
apt until you have no constraints I was

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:05,490
looking at that and I I seen an internet

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:08,610
that you should eat two grams of salt a

00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:11,340
day which is every of I think it's a lot

00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:13,140
more and it was looking at it and if I

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,539
think if you eat that how much of

00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,600
calories enough salt a day maybe you go

00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:21,830
to the hospital on the next so it will

00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:25,950
be I don't think you can eat that much

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:28,710
for one meal it will be too much for you

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,960
to get we have noticed and one now the

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:35,700
other the two thousand six hundred

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,649
calories I mean yeah the problem let's

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,320
fruit add a lot of salt and sugar and

00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:42,120
that's too much you should have in your

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,730
body so you will have problems later

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,149
maybe I don't know if maybe not you that

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:51,539
you should try it you should try it for

00:29:48,149 --> 00:29:55,230
science please please send me messages

00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:57,510
you have tried if you're okay hi thank

00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,399
you for the talk I have a question why

00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,380
can't you drink this water is whiskey

00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:05,460
water basically drink and drive you know

00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:08,070
why there is a water waste don't drink

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:12,600
that its water it's too risky whatever I

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:16,170
will buy it okay um that's well that's

00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:20,020
in Incubus gotten before

00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:21,670
and that's because that you have to

00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:25,900
study a little bit of about the

00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:29,230
distillation and you have a lot of types

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:31,840
of different alcohol types in in whiskey

00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:35,230
and you have to see em there are some

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,360
types you can get mine from it so that's

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:46,480
what you're extracting and that's in the

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:50,260
water so maybe if you yeah its water at

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:52,090
normally everything what we got in the

00:30:50,260 --> 00:31:00,820
chemical engineering prediction you

00:30:52,090 --> 00:31:04,990
don't shoot eat it or taste it well I

00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:07,240
didn't recommend to jam so does that

00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:14,020
mean if you mix waste water with whiskey

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:17,940
then you get be out of no no okay my

00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:22,540
actual question my actual question and

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:24,880
is it is it possible to have the two

00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,430
objectives I think you implement it now

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,680
the nutrition constraints as constraints

00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:32,290
yeah but can there be two objectives

00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:36,090
which are somehow weighted that you can

00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:39,850
say well that you can compromise between

00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:42,730
nutritional value and and money spent so

00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:45,460
it's it's fine if the nutrition value is

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,150
not quite as high if you save to Euro or

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,150
something like that

00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:58,250
see biopsy you see well if you can /

00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:00,980
phone a multi-objective exercise it but

00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:05,500
now using this technique for example if

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,500
you are interested in Ultima say the

00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:12,380
cause and the mini-mental care there are

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:16,429
two objectives that are different so you

00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:20,630
have to use a potato on other technique

00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:22,730
no using these techniques but yes you

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:25,279
could do it but you see no the other

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:31,880
thing this is only for one objective

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:35,630
function if you want later we can talk

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:37,519
about it what you can do will be easier

00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:41,000
if you want to do it this time it is

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,700
like this you can transform one of the

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,100
function objections and at least rain

00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:48,440
yeah so if it is satisfied you have to

00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:52,070
function absa you only have to do what

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,409
are you dealing with its to know what we

00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,440
are doing would normally we don't knows

00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:59,860
now

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,700
the speech should be food 45 minutes but

00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:08,650
I was a little bit faster I'm sorry for

00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:11,230
three any more questions nope so we can

00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:14,280
have our free meal and thanks for coming

00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,280
