Pygame Zero is a new game engine for education, built on top of
Pygame. It makes writing your first games extremely simple, while
saving beginners from certain potential pitfalls. Daniel will
introduce Pygame Zero, walk through creating a simple game, and
discuss the background for Python in education and the design
philosophy behind Pygame Zero.

Pygame Zero is a new game engine for education, built on top of
Pygame. It makes writing your first games extremely simple, while
saving beginners from certain potential pitfalls. This talk will
introduce Pygame Zero, walk through creating a simple game, and
discuss the background for Python in education and the design
philosophy behind Pygame Zero.

Pygame is a powerful set of libraries for graphics, sound, input and
more. But it is just a library: each program needs to import and set
up the libraries, implement a game loop and load resources among
numerous other concerns. While seasoned Pythonistas have no trouble
with this, teachers told us that they found it difficult to teach with
Pygame. There is simply too much boilerplate involved, and getting
students to reproduce the boilerplate perfectly before useful lessons
can begin takes too much time out of a 40-minute lesson.

Pygame Zero is simple enough that a lesson can be broken down into
bitesize steps where meaningful progress can be made with just a
couple of lines of code at a time.
