Pygame Zero is a new game engine for education, built on top of
Pygame. It makes writing your first games extremely simple, while
saving beginners from certain potential pitfalls. This talk will
introduce Pygame Zero, walk through creating a simple game, and
discuss the background for Python in education and the design
philosophy behind Pygame Zero.

Pygame is a powerful set of libraries for graphics, sound, input and
more. But it is just a library: each program needs to import and set
up the libraries, implement a game loop and load resources among
numerous other concerns. While seasoned Pythonistas have no trouble
with this, teachers told us that they found it difficult to teach with
Pygame. There is simply too much boilerplate involved, and getting
students to reproduce the boilerplate perfectly before useful lessons
can begin takes too much time out of a 40-minute lesson.

Pygame Zero is simple enough that a lesson can be broken down into
bitesize steps where meaningful progress can be made with just a
couple of lines of code at a time.

okay okay let's start good afternoon

00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,880
welcome and thank you for coming I'm

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:23,789
pleased to introduce engineer general

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:30,330
Pope who talks about pay again sure No

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:33,719
ah okay hi I'm Dan I am a reliability

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:36,329
engineer by day but for many years my

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,719
hobby has been programming games I

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:45,780
remember my first computer was an Atari

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:46,950
ST and I had st basic and stuff and I

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,500
immediately put that to one side because

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,309
it came with loads of games and so my my

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:58,289
interest in programming came from my my

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,510
love of games and I continue to program

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,370
games in my spare time particularly

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,040
during two weeks of the year which are

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,439
pie week so pie week is a week long

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,060
games programming contest where you are

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,119
challenged to write a game from scratch

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,490
in Python on a topic that is given to

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,770
you at the moment the contest starts so

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,700
you have exactly one week to write a

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,409
game and then you have to upload it and

00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:30,090
I've take part in pie week about ten

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:34,409
times but I've won it twice so I that

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,210
that kind of background was particularly

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:39,509
of interest to Nicholas when he set up

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,280
the pike on UK education track and he

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,500
kept saying well Dan you have to kind of

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,619
get involved with this because teachers

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:51,630
we love this kind of stuff so about it's

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:54,689
at four years ago the first five years

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,990
ago the the first pinecone UK education

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,159
crack rolled around and we were

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,130
challenged we're put into groups and

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,689
challenge to groups where teachers met

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,549
developers and challenged to come up

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:09,239
with some course material that the the

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:12,450
teachers could teach and so I from from

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,990
my high gain or pipe I week and pygame

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,470
background

00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,170
I dashed off the simplest possible

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,900
pygame program spout sort of 20 lines

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,970
he'd import pygame imp I gained in it

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,700
while loops and you know whatever and

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,920
one of the teachers said nope that's

00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,560
that's too difficult that can't work in

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,010
a classroom because the amount of code

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,110
that he would have to teach for a

00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,460
student to be to get something

00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,930
productive by the end of the lesson was

00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:48,240
too much so the the the best programmers

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,490
in the class the people with who got it

00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,020
would race away and be bored and the

00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,780
people who didn't get it would not have

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:57,780
got it by the end of the lesson so that

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:05,940
problem SAT around with me in my brain

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:09,000
for three or four years and then in 2014

00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,680
I think the October 2014 pie week i sat

00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,920
down to write a game and the theme was

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,560
one room I thought I'm going to write

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,190
this in a kind of way that I would write

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,880
it if I was creating a framework for

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:27,390
complete beginners to PI game and then

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:30,240
last year I turned that into a library

00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,360
which is PI game 0 so this is a library

00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,240
that takes all of the boilerplate enter

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,290
of Pi game by game is a library for

00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:42,480
access to graphics and sound and input

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,300
but wrapping that with a kind of thin

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,940
pipe and layer that lets you training

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,430
wheels for pi game as it were so you can

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,200
get up speed faster the teachers can

00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,470
teach like a couple of lines at a time

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,360
and make sure the class is caught up but

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,700
then it is just pi game underneath so

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,140
you can throw away the the training

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,000
wheels at some point and migrate to PI

00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:10,320
gain proper if you want so I'm going to

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:14,160
show pygame 0 today I've written a blank

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,560
file that's called demo by the secret of

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,910
Pi game 0 is that it doesn't run with

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,820
the standard Python interpreter you run

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:23,760
it with p gz drum so PG dead run is all

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,669
the clever machinery a blank file is a

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,300
valid pygame 0 program it creates a

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:28,680
blank window

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,539
but you can quit it which is great

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,990
because you can't do that with a blank

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:40,610
time pygame so that proves you've got

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,610
things installed then you can say def

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:54,840
screen fill ooh so two lines of code and

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:58,580
I put a blue screen so let's write a

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,580
little game I gained two

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,610
in

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,830
excuse me

00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:42,410
so that's a couple more lines but that

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:47,560
is using pygame zero magic the sorry the

00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:47,560
this mouth refers to an image so if i do

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,950
i've got the directory called images and

00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:58,790
that's where my my image files are so i

00:05:54,950 --> 00:06:01,730
don't need to do any laughing to load

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,810
those paths manipulation they are just

00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:08,000
as available as strings you can also um

00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,710
we can access them as objects in order

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,290
to get the the width and the height if

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,580
you want but the actor there has a width

00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:16,520
and height it's a pie game rectangle

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,000
which is why I can position it by mid

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,870
bottom it's got all of the pie game

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,520
attributes by left right X and Y and so

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,520
I'm going to have another thing

00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,560
going to be very topical

00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:51,059
ET months too much

00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:57,200
so I've got a pinch o these were drawn

00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,590
in inkscape by the way and then export

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:03,620
it as pings and pygame can load sorry pi

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,480
gain zero can load pings or JPEGs so

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,470
whatever file format you could you

00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,600
should just be able to save something

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,600
off the internet maybe and use it

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:15,580
immediately in the game and then I draw

00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,580
up a correct function called update

00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:32,539
oh I've got a falling pension so a

00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,909
couple more lines so two lines at a time

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:40,279
that's what we're aiming for so if I say

00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:43,509
if keyboard left shouldn't I should

00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:43,509
chasing the words easier to spell

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:08,400
and then I said these these actors are

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I'll just rats so I could do if

00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:41,020
a so I think that program is easy enough

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,930
to grasp I think the by moving all of

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,850
the complexity out of out of the pie

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,150
game program that you would write into

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:52,030
pie game 0 we pray to something that is

00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:53,740
much simpler to get started just at that

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,620
level where you're transitioning from

00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:01,600
something like scratch the kids will do

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:05,290
scratch up to the age of 10 9 like

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,450
subtle nods and then in the UK

00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:09,370
curriculum they have to transition to a

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,070
textual programming language but scratch

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:16,450
has the ability to create characters and

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:19,150
move them around out of the box so that

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,420
stuff is very accessible for python

00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:26,100
programming I think we're in a situation

00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:30,130
where the out-of-the-box experience is

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:35,470
worse I think you if your basic programs

00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:37,450
are what is your name hello name that's

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,000
a big gap from where you work just we're

00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:43,150
in scratch to where you are in Python so

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,950
pygame zero sort of fills that niche for

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,780
getting up to speed up you know getting

00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,150
something graphical on the screen to

00:09:49,780 --> 00:10:00,700
keep kids engaged as they as their

00:09:52,150 --> 00:10:02,500
programming career continues this was

00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:07,470
written in Python 3 I think that's

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:10,450
important as well so the background for

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,600
pygame and Python 3 is sort of a bit

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:15,700
incomplete teachers told told me that

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,650
they wanted just pie get a Python 3

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:20,680
stuff they wanted to be able to teach

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:24,790
one language and so the Python 23 split

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:26,560
was a big problem when this was written

00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:30,610
and I think this is still the case there

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,499
is no official release of pie gain for

00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:36,659
Python 3 so a part of this was

00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:40,109
actually finding ways to install pygame

00:10:36,659 --> 00:10:44,129
in Python 3 and that is all in the

00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:47,459
documentation so there are ways of doing

00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:49,199
it it works but pygame is catching up

00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:51,949
actually so there are now binary wheels

00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:55,459
on pi PI that I think of for the

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:58,679
pre-release tag so you have to say pip

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:08,939
minus minus pre or something but you can

00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:11,189
install pygame and okay so I was going

00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:14,729
to show you some of the other things

00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:16,589
that pie games there I can do so draw an

00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:18,659
update or your basic bread and butter

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:20,549
for creating games for animation so draw

00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:22,469
will draw the screen that would be

00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:24,869
called whenever my game Terry wants to

00:11:22,469 --> 00:11:26,909
update the draw the screen refresh the

00:11:24,869 --> 00:11:29,879
screen update is called 60 times a

00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:31,469
second anyway so if you don't define

00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,899
update you can create games that are

00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:36,319
click driven I'll show you the cliq API

00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,319
so

00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,990
right so all I needed to do was create a

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:59,220
function called on onmousedown and

00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:05,640
pygame 0 we'll call that function if I

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:08,450
wanted to know what button I what button

00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,450
was clicked like go

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,600
I do anything with a button

00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:38,449
so you see I've got pygame zero is

00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:43,980
adapting to the cool back that i define

00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:45,630
and i was demoing this too i was sharing

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,860
this around the internet with some of

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,990
the teachers who've been involved in the

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:54,480
pike on UK education track and dave had

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:58,769
said it doesn't work it's just not

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,860
working he'd written that and I was

00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:05,430
dismayed that the very first experience

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:06,959
he had with this this tool was something

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:11,639
that didn't work and didn't really any

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,949
feedback on why so if you misspell a

00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,420
function it's got a spell checker and

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:17,399
will tell you that you might have

00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,160
misspelled things I think that's the the

00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,139
kind of philosophy of pie game 0 is that

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,300
we've done a lot of work actually in

00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,550
sort of catching errors re raising them

00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:29,880
with better messages because that kind

00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:30,870
of feedback about if you if something

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,660
breaks and it doesn't give you any

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:41,060
information as to why that is a obstacle

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:44,610
to continuing your your learning so

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:47,160
every time we could take something that

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:54,810
the the underlying pygame was doing and

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:56,790
make it more explicit we've done that I

00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:58,019
think I will stop there and invite

00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,880
questions because the questions have

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,769
been very good in the previous times

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,130
like taking this talk and I'd rather

00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:09,829
sort of I want to know what you want out

00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:09,829
of this this tool so any questions

00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:24,410
if I I do you want a

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,639
when Toronto window up yes so I just

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:47,329
wanted to ask if there is that can

00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:49,610
included way like for easy publishing of

00:14:47,329 --> 00:14:52,100
your game especially for kids yeah so

00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:56,740
because like they won't go into

00:14:52,100 --> 00:15:00,279
different fighter isolation stuff no but

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:02,600
high-gain Sarah was created with a

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:06,649
understanding of the kind of portability

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,600
problems that show up on when you when

00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:11,089
you distribute game so having done pie

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:13,670
week a lot of times every time you use

00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:15,350
OpenGL for example it will work

00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,360
perfectly on all of the machines that

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,850
you develop on and then somebody will

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,940
run it and there's a driver problem so

00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:25,970
PI game is ideal for the distribution of

00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:28,250
games because it just works if it's

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:31,959
there it just works its CPU rendering

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:34,550
just slow but it's incredibly reliable

00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:38,060
also pygame 0 will catch problems with

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:41,019
file names for example so if I if I

00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,019
rename

00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:53,529
yeah well doesn't exist I

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,970
then it will give me an error that my

00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,530
game could possibly not be exchanged

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,500
with somebody with a different file

00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:14,500
system that was case insensitive okay

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:19,420
case yeah case insensitive so that kind

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:22,930
of problem is to the best of my ability

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:25,240
sort of dealt with by by PI game 0 the

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,830
actual sort of packaging of games just

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,660
reading them i think is a is a future

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:38,260
problem but something i think we would

00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:44,200
like to so uh why three well yes it's a

00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:49,870
problem for everybody yeah yes so

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:51,160
packaging yes and distribution yes i

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:52,540
think that comes later I think that's

00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:58,090
something that we should we should build

00:16:52,540 --> 00:17:00,550
the the PI game's hero distribution is

00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:02,710
just like a directory really so if you

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,830
have pi game 0 installed zipping up a

00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:07,030
directory and just sharing the images

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,240
directory in the sounds directory and

00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,880
the script and generally it's assumed

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,260
there is one script this is for for

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,130
programs that are simple enough to be in

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:21,460
one module then that could be run on any

00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:26,890
computer with plug in 0 there is another

00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:28,720
project I've got internet I can I've

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:33,480
been working on something called and the

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:36,700
edge ooh bundle which is an attempt to

00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,570
provide a redistributable sort of bundle

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:46,440
for Python for education that has pygame

00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:51,490
0pi game pie cutie Nicholas's new editor

00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:54,070
available so I think by pursuing all of

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,820
these avenues we can make gains easier

00:17:54,070 --> 00:18:03,670
for well and Python easier for kids to

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:07,270
to use at school and at home yeah

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,490
what about networking because in in

00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:11,590
games it's also interesting if you're I

00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:15,010
don't know your colleague from school

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:18,040
can play right your latest game um yes

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:23,680
since I got to Nikolas is bring his hand

00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:27,520
up so there's network 04 that we were

00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:31,660
going to answer more fleet so inspired

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,400
by Dan's awesome work with my game 0 as

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,620
I mentioned in my keynote other people

00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:38,170
have been doing something something 0

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,440
libraries following the same philosophy

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,660
that Dan has and Tim golden who's I

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,330
think or developer based in London his

00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:48,190
creative network 0 he tried out out at

00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,490
the London Python code dojo and we had

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:53,530
an awful lot of fun breaking it the

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:55,390
important thing is that um tim has also

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,150
been trying it out with teachers as well

00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:59,890
I'm getting their feedback and just to

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,630
echo what down the sink I'm getting

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,130
teachers involved in this is essential

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:05,110
because they are the experts in dealing

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:09,010
with children um those developers we

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:10,060
think kids might want to do but its

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,250
teachers who actually deal with them

00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,870
every day but there's network 0 I can't

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,360
see wide network 0 couldn't work with my

00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,280
game 0 and Q right and Bend not all of

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,970
the raspberry pi foundation created gpio

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:25,210
0 and also the hashtag 0 all the things

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:28,510
so what you need to do is create a pie

00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,780
game 0 project that uses gpio 0 on a PI

00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,640
0 raspberry pi 0 with network 0 as well

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:37,290
and then you've zeroed all the things

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,290
and you can legitimately use the Hatter

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,920
Hey so we talked yesterday evening and I

00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:49,810
just want to repeat this suggestion you

00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,270
can actually bundle this thing with

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,980
fight whether to have a single

00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:57,880
executable file that doesn't need

00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:00,010
installation I think I probably a good

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,860
thing to have but I have not written

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:06,370
that yet but yeah of course but I'm just

00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,640
saying that maybe that's a good thing to

00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:13,000
look into and also you could run the zip

00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:17,200
files directly right yes like they have

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,960
here I think so

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,889
so that wasn't really a question yet so

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:31,450
i guess as you suggest speakers i should

00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:35,679
mention that this is on bitbucket g0 and

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:40,590
so pull requests are accepted and this

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:44,049
is a community what you pointing some

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,929
okay thumbs up right okay yes it's

00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:49,389
community project and and it sort of

00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:52,840
relies on the feed but I'm not a teacher

00:20:49,389 --> 00:20:55,269
I am going on feedback from teachers but

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,880
i need the feedback of people who have

00:20:55,269 --> 00:21:00,370
tried teaching kids with this to improve

00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:03,669
it and any time that you see an error

00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:06,309
message that is opaque or something

00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:07,690
doesn't work and doesn't give a trace

00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,130
backer doesn't give any indication as to

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,460
why it's not working that could be

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:17,019
considered a bug so please report it if

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:19,149
nothing else okay another question so

00:21:17,019 --> 00:21:22,330
since arriving in bilbao where are my

00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:23,409
school sorry hello ah right right to the

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,929
back okay we're underneath the light

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:29,080
since arriving at bilbao discovered that

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,850
my spanish is exactly zero and a lot of

00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:33,220
people spun ish people's english is also

00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:34,870
0 what options are there for

00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,730
internationalizing so that an 11 year

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:41,549
old Spanish kid for example doesn't have

00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:41,549
to learn English to do onmousedown etc

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:49,659
yeah I think it's probably difficult to

00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:53,649
conceive of way that you could

00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:57,519
internationalize this without making in

00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:59,350
compatibility problems I think also that

00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,669
english is the language of programming

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:05,139
and you know the Python libraries are

00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:10,299
and the and the Pythian keywords are

00:22:05,139 --> 00:22:11,919
English on the other hand I think it's

00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:14,980
very reasonable that the documentation

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,960
should be translated so if anybody would

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,500
like to contribute a translation for the

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,769
documentation or contribute any kind of

00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:27,320
tutorial or blog post that would be

00:22:22,769 --> 00:22:29,999
appreciated okay the last question

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,669
thanks very much and this looks like it

00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:34,350
would be quite a nice way of building

00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:41,570
not just games but generic interfaces

00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:44,610
for interaction with all kinds of things

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,830
how suit is is it to playing the role of

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:50,460
a kind of generic graphical interface

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:52,619
builder you can write full graphical

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,239
interfaces in my game and people have

00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:56,549
done it but I think at that point you're

00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:58,080
probably not you're probably best if you

00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,789
want to attack that kind of problem

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,009
using pi game itself and there are

00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:06,450
libraries that do sort of the GUI

00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:08,789
widgets for embedding in a pie going

00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:13,070
game that sort of mimic the the kind of

00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:15,629
platform widgets but i think it's not

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,119
that kind of programming becomes more

00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:21,779
complicated than I think pygame 0 is

00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:24,600
targeting so I think if you want to do

00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:29,399
that that's and I certainly could see

00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:32,639
that if PI game 0 was was to include

00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:35,309
some GUI tools to share games for

00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:38,580
example to like to bundle them up to

00:23:35,309 --> 00:23:41,549
sort of enter some some details and an

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,379
icon or something then that could be

00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:45,749
done with a GUI that was written in in

00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:49,950
PI game but may not use PI game 0 to do

00:23:45,749 --> 00:23:54,320
it ok ok thank you down you for your

00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:54,320
interest companies thank you very much

00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,790
