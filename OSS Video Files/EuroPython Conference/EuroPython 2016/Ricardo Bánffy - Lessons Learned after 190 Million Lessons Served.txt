okay everybody is here we have a final

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,480
speaker for today it's Ricardo bouncy I

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:19,470
was going to talk about lessons learned

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:23,730
after 119 million lessons served hi good

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:28,349
afternoon thank you for coming I'm here

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,260
to talk about some lessons before

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,800
anything else I have to say that I am

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,690
new to udemy and most of what what I'll

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,610
describe happen before I arrived what

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,879
I'll talk about is therefore the work of

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:50,460
other people and the lessons however i

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:53,489
think they stand on their own well this

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,480
is where we are now udemy was founded in

00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:01,079
2010 and in six years it grew to 11

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:05,220
million students 40,000 courses given by

00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,530
20,000 instructors in 80 languages the

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,530
190 million less and served number i

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,299
used for the title was gathered from a

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:21,180
table that tracks student watching our

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:29,670
videos lesson one is about preserving

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:32,820
the our culture as we grow we are

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:36,290
learning company and learning is in our

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,939
DNA for any healthy organization

00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:43,829
preserving its culture is essential to

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,290
its well-being what I'll talk about is

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:52,040
about engineering team or the teams have

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,040
different different things they do

00:01:53,960 --> 00:02:01,500
well we are very serious about

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,430
onboarding onboarding new employees the

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:08,369
idea is to get a new hire from a new

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:13,319
hire to a productive engineer in the

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:15,830
shortest possible time we use extensive

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,780
automation to have standardized

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,959
development environments development

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:25,500
environment that's reasonably flexible

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:27,540
and if you really want to you are able

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:32,220
to deploy our website on your first day

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:41,010
I did that in the first week even I can

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:46,470
do it we learn and teach ourselves using

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:49,530
our own tools there are you Demi courses

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:52,190
about our applications from the user

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:56,940
perspective from the backend perspective

00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:59,340
that are given by our own team so you

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,230
can hear about application as it is

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,230
described by the people who created it

00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:12,200
we also communicate a lot we have

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,200
hundreds of people in three continents

00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:21,690
and we spend 11 time zones we all hang

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:29,000
out and slack we use hipchat until ice

00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:33,060
like yesterday literally we just moved

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,320
we also use scrum we have the usual

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:43,859
stand-ups grooming sessions we also have

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:47,310
hangouts hangouts we can do we conduct

00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:49,819
all hands meetings on hang out or other

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,220
solutions if we have too many people

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:56,190
every meeting room is capable of joining

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,040
a hangout we have big screen camera good

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,320
microphone so we can join we have

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,900
meetings we can't have easily meetings

00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:11,329
that spanned more than

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:13,939
team in one place well like I said

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:18,680
before we use automation a lot we

00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:21,799
automate the quality checks we we can't

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,500
commit ugly code seriously we can't

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:31,310
commit code with one extra line we can't

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:37,580
commit code with missing spaces we can't

00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:40,400
push broken code that means get runs a

00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,060
basic set of tests before we are allowed

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,350
to commit if you are allowed to pass to

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:52,880
commit its flake eight so still anyway

00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:56,330
and you can't merge if your code doesn't

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,949
pass a very extensive set of tests so

00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,990
you're absolutely sure that when you

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:10,810
merge your code you will not break

00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:14,740
anything also we also use custom tools

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:18,770
custom Django admin scripts cost of

00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:21,800
Django admin commands to help prevent

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,919
accidents so if you want to update a

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,409
series of Records a series of objects in

00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:31,330
the datastore you will not be handed a

00:05:27,409 --> 00:05:33,800
sequel my sequel prompt in fact it's

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:37,280
very few people who have that kind of

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:40,909
access instead you have you'll do that

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:46,400
through code that's reviewed by someone

00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:49,280
else that's known to be I won't say bug

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,820
free but it probably is last book free

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:59,330
than you typing sequel commands on the

00:05:51,820 --> 00:06:01,490
my sequel prompt or even though we do we

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:06,860
go to such great lengths to prevent that

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:09,380
some accidents happen I myself deleted a

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,960
shared database on my first week for

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:13,340
tweak the company I was out of the

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,460
Dublin office where I'm days it was a

00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,210
San Francisco

00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,699
and I deleted one of our shared lay the

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,919
basis not production environment

00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:24,960
development environment but thanks to me

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,580
the whole development team with the San

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,530
Francisco office it was very large

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:37,380
actually had a mandatory coffee break

00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:40,710
because no one could do anything yeah

00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:43,650
there's some room for improvement what

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:47,180
we can do to that well we have that

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:51,139
shared database we're working now to

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:53,759
have an individual database for everyone

00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:57,509
with just enough data so you can so that

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:02,070
you can run your development with

00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:05,490
meaningful data we also constantly make

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:10,050
improvements to our development

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,599
environment we add all the time we add

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:18,240
code that makes it easier to develop we

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:19,710
add extra checks we add some extra

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,060
functionalities that were not there

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:28,409
before personally last week I think no

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:30,210
last month I added a bit of code that

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:33,990
made some free objects represent

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:37,259
themselves in a nicer way on the

00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:40,349
terminal on the ipd be prompt it was a

00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:44,250
horrendously complicated logic and by

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:49,409
that I had someone lessened my cognitive

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:51,659
workload so that I my with my somewhat

00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:53,610
limited brain I could wrap it around a

00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:56,009
very complicated problem without having

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,539
to worry about imagining what the

00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,539
objects would like I could just bring

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:02,719
them on the screen and have look into

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,719
them

00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:13,309
the second thing the second lesson is

00:08:09,619 --> 00:08:15,259
that as you grow you start to you have

00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:17,919
to look all the time you should you

00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:20,869
should be measuring everything anyway

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:26,749
when you grow you'll start measuring

00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:30,050
measuring it in bulk so every

00:08:26,749 --> 00:08:34,880
application we have generates collects

00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:38,779
metrics about themselves about itself we

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,639
collect those metrics in a huge not

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:44,420
Facebook huge but still pretty

00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:48,769
impressive scale for that we use stuff

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,889
like sentry data dog and chart I yo this

00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:54,319
is not although this is considered

00:08:51,889 --> 00:08:57,019
something important to us these

00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:58,940
applications are good enough so we don't

00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:06,040
have to develop them again these guys

00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:09,019
are good so there are century for alerts

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:16,010
Google Analytics the most of front-end

00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:18,829
is constantly monitored your dad also we

00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,230
have a huge user base with that comes

00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:23,510
the possibility of doing extensive tests

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,790
in experiments where you enable some

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,310
feature and you can track on a B tests

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:30,319
now the user base behaves since you have

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:34,850
a lot of people coming you'll have a

00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:37,160
good quality data on that and we can

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,380
actually know how something will impact

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,639
as well before we enable it to the whole

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:47,510
user base this way surprise are

00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:54,019
minimized which is good I like I can

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:58,220
like surprises that also allows us to

00:09:54,019 --> 00:10:02,510
have early warnings if something starts

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:05,480
to if you see the distribution say of

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:08,420
execution time a given function and you

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:11,300
have a peek at like 100 milliseconds and

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:15,069
you start developing a peek at zero

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,840
milliseconds you know something is wrong

00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:22,930
so you can watch those

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:27,650
tributions on a tool like data dog and

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:32,090
this data must be timely we must receive

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:36,470
it soon after its collected we must be

00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:40,280
able to see it immediately this large

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,110
user base is all it's convenient because

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,530
it generates a lot of data data we can

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:50,690
analyze but it also amplifies any trend

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:55,970
very quickly and it's really not that

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:59,390
good for you if you only know that what

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,420
caused an outage of a week-long outage

00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:08,630
of a service you don't want that you

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:16,730
want to know if possible before am I

00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:20,230
going too fast No ah yeah I suspect you

00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:25,100
like this one it's about questioning and

00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:33,950
being a bit of a willing to abandon an

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:37,070
approach let me say that day Netscape in

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:39,290
this case delayed a new version by three

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:42,110
years they did it by making a single

00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:45,020
worst strategic mistake that any

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:50,260
software company can make they decided

00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:53,510
to rewrite the code from scratch okay

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:57,350
this is George polski who knows Joe's

00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:00,820
polski raise her hand well for those who

00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:04,640
don't know him he is a pretty clever guy

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,250
he grated a lot of stuff used daily like

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:12,470
Trello or stack overflow who is a stack

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:14,900
overflow here come on now I don't

00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:21,490
believe you no no everyone should raise

00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:24,560
hands that okay he said it in an article

00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:27,110
this things you should never do that

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,070
everyone should read even if you want to

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,070
disagree with him later

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:39,529
told you would like it yes we moved from

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:42,529
PHP we had a large PHP application built

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:49,790
on a custom-made framework created by

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:54,520
designed internally by our founders who

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:54,520
here has has built their own framework

00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:05,810
who thought at that time it was a good

00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:12,290
idea who regrets that now okay we're

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:14,930
good this is a problem because new hires

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:19,570
have to be trained on a framework they

00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:22,820
have never seen and it takes a long time

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:26,350
it ties an expensive resource it is an

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,120
engineer that's already trained on that

00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:31,279
and the engineer will be tied and not

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,350
building useful things useful things for

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:38,210
the business useful features things

00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:43,880
users are demanding that specific code

00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:46,670
base at the very little tests with the

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:53,480
lack of tasks maintenance becomes

00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:56,930
walking on the minefield the fear of

00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:59,210
breaking stuff and not seeing it until

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,960
it goes into production or worse yet and

00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:08,570
to the corrupt user data will drive you

00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:11,620
to adopt a a very careful approach you

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,920
will always you end up opting for safe

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:18,860
changes instead of using instead of

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:25,640
writing some more maintainable more

00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:28,190
elegant more performant code you may

00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,170
even be tempted to replicate side

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,850
effects of a previous implementation out

00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,600
of fear you'll break something you are

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:39,439
not seeing and obviously this makes

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:43,139
development slower and more expensive

00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:47,970
so what did they do and I say they

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:50,730
because I arrived right after the the

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:53,999
migration was finished so I didn't even

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:57,420
see that happening such a shame i'd love

00:14:53,999 --> 00:15:03,480
to see that aw glad to be able to delete

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:05,309
some PHP code so what did they do no

00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,649
they didn't jump for the first

00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:10,949
technology or the technology they love

00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:13,800
the most they actually created a project

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:19,399
and evaluated they evaluated about the

00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:22,350
various options they did a small

00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,579
proof-of-concept project with each of

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:32,579
those and with what they learned they

00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:34,800
guided the decision they looked into how

00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:38,279
easy it was to develop for that platform

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:42,839
what they knew how well the platform

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:46,740
encourages good practices and how easy

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:53,639
it is it would be to own board a new

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:59,370
engineers and on yes this is a serious

00:15:53,639 --> 00:16:05,189
project it's not a lot of resources was

00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:08,910
put behind it they set deadlines they

00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:10,910
agreed on goals they did that as thick

00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:16,709
as if the company depended on it because

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:18,839
actually did well I know you probably

00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:20,519
have guessed which technology they chose

00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,699
because I wouldn't be here talking about

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:25,319
it I would be on nude conf or something

00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:30,889
so other conference selling stuff

00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:34,589
instead of here well what you got what

00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:38,639
and what beautiful environment I'm I

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:41,790
have the luxury of working with well we

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,720
got a modern Django based application

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:48,839
and modern it runs in Python 3.5 and

00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,190
jungle 1.8 we are considering the move

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,700
to

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:59,570
1.9 it also allows us to onboard

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:01,730
engineers much quicker because Django is

00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,220
an opinionated framework and you don't

00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:06,890
have to teach every decision we made

00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,000
every decision you to be made a lot of

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:13,490
decisions already baked in the platform

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,410
we have eighty eight percent of test

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:22,370
coverage that's not perfect we can do we

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:25,459
probably will improve that one of the

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:28,940
things is that we can't commit code we

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,500
can't merge code if with the merge the

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:36,650
code coverage goes below a certain

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:41,690
threshold I have cursed this decision a

00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:45,110
couple times myself in the end it's for

00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:49,130
good we found that we had also a lot of

00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:52,790
new features we had a more consistent

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:57,380
code base which is what opinionated

00:17:52,790 --> 00:18:00,260
framers frameworks are for and well

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,000
there's some of course as anything that

00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,870
was migrated there is some scar tissue

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,390
where PHP and Django got who existed

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:14,390
some call names are a bit odd some field

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:17,210
names are a bit interesting and do we

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,840
have some special few types and some

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:22,700
parts when we have to find to fight

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,070
Django's opinions and let me tell you

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:31,520
Django is very persistent in fighting

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:37,480
back who had here to fight back now you

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:41,410
have to come on some raise a hand okay

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:44,830
and what we did we learn from that well

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,559
the immigration took a while with two

00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:52,059
ears two years with thirty percent of

00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:53,860
the engineering team dedicated to it it

00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:59,940
was done incrementally feature by

00:18:53,860 --> 00:19:05,679
feature and there is a motivation thing

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:09,610
on that the the team involved the team

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,799
responsible for the migration track the

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,110
progress by counting the lines they

00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:16,270
actually delete it this is why I'm

00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:21,640
wearing this t-shirt they call

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:26,169
themselves the billet inators we've

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:30,480
tried deserved one arm I borrowed the

00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:30,480
t-shirt I didn't delete any HP line so

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:39,669
all the time the website was up and

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:42,610
running and it was as you would browse

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:45,280
the pages you would see an hybrid PHP

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:52,650
Django application showing you your page

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,650
showing the data you were used to also

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:59,230
since everything was changing mind

00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:02,740
settles mindsets would have to change so

00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:05,710
that's where the ultimate automated

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,160
checks come from so instead of ending up

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:11,140
with an antacid codebase they enforce

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,850
some things that they consider mistakes

00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,980
they learned from the PHP the code base

00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:21,910
and they worked against the impulse to

00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:24,150
allow the Django code base to be like

00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,150
that

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:36,200
there's also final lesson here this is

00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:38,870
about the importance of the mission they

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,400
mentioned and start you we are learning

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:48,200
company we exist to help anyone learn

00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:50,870
anything that's why to go this also

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:56,929
means that anyone can teach something to

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:59,179
anyone else we all have things we like

00:20:56,929 --> 00:21:02,240
to talk about rock of passions we all

00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:06,530
have stuff that he would like to teach

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,080
other people if you could or there are

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,789
stuff we'd like to know more if only we

00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:18,350
could find a person who could teach us

00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:21,380
Oh what is the impact about one-third of

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:24,919
um students or starting or growing their

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:29,200
own business using the knowledge they

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:32,179
acquired through the platform for that

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,460
we also have lots of people who became

00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:41,110
full-time instructor instructors who

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:43,820
basically changed careers from being

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:47,860
something to teaching that's something

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:52,059
they love to do if you visit our stand

00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:55,880
you'll see a couple sheets of stories of

00:21:52,059 --> 00:22:01,250
how you did me change the lives of those

00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:05,600
people and I'll tell one of those source

00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:14,090
not one of that's on the that shape

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:16,220
those paper sheets oh well I'll tell the

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,530
story as it was told to me by my

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:26,990
colleague Aaron who actually knows this

00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:29,419
smiling nice guy he's lynn smith he had

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:33,140
a lifetime career as a copywriter he

00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:36,720
wrote ads for companies like Vodafone

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:41,159
Lloyd's BBC IBM

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:45,179
and after this lifetime career he

00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:48,809
decided it was time to retire and to

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:52,710
keep himself busy as his career as he

00:22:48,809 --> 00:22:55,980
winded down his company his career he

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,990
got involved with you Demi and he

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:05,100
decided to start I can start teaching

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:10,230
people to write proper copy well it

00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:14,429
turns out he probably didn't retire

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:22,440
because as of now he has taught more

00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:24,510
than 650 56,000 students I myself was

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,020
very impressed with his number because I

00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:33,360
was once a teacher and my largest class

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:36,570
was like 50 suit 50 60 students on for a

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:39,480
course that took 20 classes 20 weekly

00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:43,140
classes if I were to get close to what

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:49,080
is this guy did after he retired it will

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:57,990
take me few 500 years to do that this is

00:23:49,080 --> 00:24:00,210
a 10x guy the 500x guy probably when I

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:04,350
read the stories when I read the

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:08,520
messages are internal emails and forward

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:14,130
that our students sent I see our mission

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:16,710
is very very important in the end

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:21,120
everything we do everything we do at

00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:24,780
udemy everything we all do here at

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,450
Europe ithan is about the people is

00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:29,580
about community it's about people it's

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:36,160
about teaching it's about learning and

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:50,710
sharing this is what we do thank you

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:56,550
oh one more thing if you in case you buy

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:56,550
a course if you use the import this 40

00:24:56,790 --> 00:25:01,260
code you'll get a forty percent discount

00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:21,430
any questions okay give it bigger okay

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:23,620
there's thank you I know nothing about

00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,980
Django but you say that you have to

00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:30,670
fight the framework back jago-ji an

00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:33,010
example like i don't know jack is an

00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:35,830
opinionated framework so it assumes you

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:42,340
want to do stuff in a certain specific

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:46,540
way i know it's no longer the case but a

00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:50,140
good example i can bring up this from i

00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:52,930
think a long time ago and i met that

00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:59,080
situation i wanted to i was doing an

00:25:52,930 --> 00:26:04,090
image bank for a portal and we wanted to

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:08,440
save the images the originals in a way

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:11,110
that they would be duplicated with which

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:13,410
meant we would change the the file name

00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,670
that was uploaded to a different one and

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,710
they would quite a day we would place it

00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:21,520
on a different folder than what django

00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:25,180
wanted to do it took me like one week to

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:28,150
build the application and three weeks to

00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,670
build the logic to allow the application

00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:35,500
to save the files where we wanted them

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:37,860
to and it was really really ugly code at

00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,860
that

00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:52,490
anyone else hi you said that junko and

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,789
old PHP code coexist at the same time

00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:58,399
right you you probably didn't just flip

00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:00,710
the switch so can you explain this a bit

00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:03,769
more like you probably couldn't use

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:07,940
internal jungle road system and other

00:27:03,769 --> 00:27:12,580
features like how did you manage to do

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,580
this that the both systems coexist

00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:19,940
Django and PHP shared the same database

00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:22,100
with the same data that's why we have

00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:26,750
some strange table names in some parts

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:30,710
of some older parts of the system the

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:33,080
URL routing was done both on the web

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,259
server and a Django application so some

00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:40,519
some of the URLs would direct the PHP

00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:44,929
application some send you to the Django

00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:47,809
application is that what you wanted ok

00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:51,080
so after you lunch fully jungle then you

00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:53,059
had to do some cleanup the code yes what

00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,940
was basically hard-coded some of the

00:27:53,059 --> 00:28:00,169
Royals and yeah as the as the PHP code

00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:03,919
was being removed the rules that sent to

00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:13,029
get the code itself it was deleted from

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:13,029
the configuration any more questions

00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,270
sorry it's not planned but I can clarify

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:24,100
the routing what we did is we had an

00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:26,290
engine X front-end lobe answer and we

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,390
had roots custom roots of giant routing

00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:30,250
table in there that was selectively

00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,750
route traffic to the django app or let

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,190
her route back to the PHP f we just

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,690
slowly deleted those routes and they're

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:36,220
more and more routes fall through to the

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:38,440
django app that's basically how we

00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,480
flipped over without doing a big bang

00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,680
release so things went wrong we could

00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,930
just simply add the route back in and

00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:48,880
went back to the PHP up again okay thank

00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:52,680
you for that so I hope to see you all at

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,680
