the organizers and the Python society

00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:47,850
would like to ask everyone to do to all

00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:53,129
the problems we are facing today

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:57,090
like attacks and things I would like to

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:00,480
ask you first to have a minute of

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,850
silence and just to think about things

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,239
that we as hackers could do to make

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,239
things better

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,400
thank you

00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:19,380
so now let's start unfortunately today

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:22,400
we've set up the show in the stage first

00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,400
we prepared

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:33,390
unfortunately this morning oh yeah

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:37,709
hosting the stage was injured so he

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:41,060
cannot be here so I hope you will

00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:41,060
forgive any glitches or

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:34,900
bienvenidos - bienvenidos Wow was that a

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:37,569
gravitational wave also we want to

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,500
welcome you to the magnificient city of

00:03:37,569 --> 00:03:40,480
Belleville

00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,629
the biggest city of the basque country

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:48,840
which we are pretty sure you'll enjoy as

00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:51,840
well as the conference for this opening

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,840
presentation

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:33,250
but it has less connections and it's

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:36,060
less big compared to Berlin even more

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,060
surprising

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:13,290
start talking during the conference so

00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:13,290
we can actually have

00:09:44,700 --> 00:10:55,890
you can see the another one I'm afraid

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,059

00:11:43,200 --> 00:12:26,810
so the main show is running the go

00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,810
