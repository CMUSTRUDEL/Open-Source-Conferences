room to split and let the attendees

00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:01,219

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:13,389
three locations were based in Vancouver

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,670
Dublin and Shanghai and swim for

00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,610
services that we provide include one of

00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,589
the biggest ones would be matchmaking

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:23,199
leaderboards cool five storage media

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:26,889
storage social network linking did a

00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:29,440
warehousing the remaining I guess who's

00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:32,199
fighting pieces we've been around since

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,019
2003 however we were acquired by

00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:37,540
Activision back in two thousand seven so

00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,430
we are written a huge scale we provide

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,470
these services solely for Activision

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,949
titles one of the main ones in call of

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,920
duty Skylanders we also operate the call

00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,990
of duty online which is in Shanghai

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:53,079
after the Chinese market Diablo

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:55,509
destination aims at a few so i guess the

00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:58,870
exciting stuff is that we operate with a

00:09:55,509 --> 00:10:02,350
huge number of users / 459 million

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:05,740
claritin and 2.2 million concurrent

00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:08,079
online gamers so we get a massive number

00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,810
of requests you can imagine and average

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,699
response time 20 seconds and again we do

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:17,230
with a massive amount of data as well so

00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:19,870
over 10 petabytes of data and the

00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:22,180
technologies that we work with so we're

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,819
here at you're a Python so our product

00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,920
is written in Python we also an

00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:29,889
interface atoms begin to see for scoffs

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,360
and record it with the airline and you

00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:33,009
have other options as well in the

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,829
infrastructure space we work with

00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,079
Cassandra might as well publish a lot of

00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:41,880
our software engineering positions and

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,880
my server focused on the other

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:48,960

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,540
this is a standard office environment so

00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,430
we have a lot of fun and guest speaker

00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:48,310
work quite seriously but not so much to

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:50,380
ourselves and here is our website all of

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:52,600
our careers are posted on the website we

00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,960
have a standard slide as well and my

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,960
team in aggressive

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:04,660
thank you next sponsor will be criteria

00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,019
and I would invite the higher team to be

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,019
ready to

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:20,830
I so you know you're from an engineering

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:25,330
company when you make presentations

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:27,280
without a slide so we're from video it's

00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,260
not there but uh we're everywhere I'm

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,140
sure you're gonna see us when you move

00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:35,170
around so creteil simply is a global

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:37,150
leader in retargeting advertisement so I

00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,920
believe some of the problems that might

00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:43,120
have class wellbut to find out what we

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:46,240
do it's simple so let's say lady here in

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,040
red probably goes on adidas.com to shop

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,270
once in a while but sometimes she

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,390
doesn't she decides not to buy anything

00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,400
so what we do is that we retarget you

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:57,430
with ads for adidas and then that

00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,980
combats into sales so once you click to

00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:02,200
buy something if you don't click to buy

00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,000
anything we lose money we lose money all

00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,860
the time but sometimes we make money as

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,930
well so the moment you click to buy

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,930
something creature makes money adidas

00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:14,950
makes money the world is happy and what

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:18,910
happens with this software is bit war

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,620
it's obviously built by our huge chunk

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,290
of engineers who work with us we have a

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:25,360
global number of Engineers of about four

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,610
hundred and thirty people and it's not

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,520
stopping the company is young it's been

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,960

soon so we're definitely hiring from

00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,020

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,000
one of the most valuable you know

00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,480
languages we use we use other languages

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,560
like Java C sharp and whatnot but at the

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,860
moment we definitely you can into Python

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,480

millions of dollars and the principle of

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,950
hi guys manga co-founder and director of

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:07,110
engineering taja hunters are small but

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,690
fast-growing start of that does user

00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:12,120
analytics so it's basically a set of

00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,190
tools that allows website owners to find

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:15,510
out more what their users are doing I'd

00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:19,250
like to share this video with you that

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,250
does a better job at explaining exactly

00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:34,120
today most sites are built and improved

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,910
based on hunches and guesses but maybe

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,580
we just don't need to guess anymore take

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:42,070
pot jar instead of guessing what

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,870
motivates our users behavior you can now

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:47,020
see which bits of your site they love

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:49,630
where they click tap move how far they

00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,540
scroll and what they totally ignore and

00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,220
by playing videos of your visitors it's

00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,740
as if you're watching the screen over

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,600
their shoulder so you can see what turns

00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:03,520
them off your site and causes

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,500
abandonment but it doesn't end there you

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,170
can also ask questions directly to your

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:10,770
visitors ultimately this means you can

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:12,460
optimize your website's user experience

00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:14,860
prioritizing content that needs

00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:18,100
attention for quick and effective

00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,560
results overall hot jars range of

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,600
features gives you access to solid proof

00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:25,560
about your users behavior so wave

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:29,790
goodbye to old fashioned Network hot jar

00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:29,790
all-in-one analytics and feedback

00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,890
Roger

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:46,299
insurance is slow complicated unzan

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,100
flexible suits in the insurance

00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:50,140
companies who will like it that way

00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,380
which means when you need to borrow a

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,380
friend

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,409
so yeah I'm hutchison all in one

00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:08,169
Olympics and feedback to and a couple of

00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:10,510
years ago more the founders had startups

00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:12,130
and the most frustrating thing we found

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:14,140
was that we couldn't understand why

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,250
people were coming to our sites and

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,380
leave are not converting at the

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,330
customers or they were converting in

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,299
customers and just stopped using our

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:24,220
service after a month or so and we

00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,320
wanted to figure out how we could get to

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,120
know why our users were acting the way

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,309
they did so we had some research and we

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,140
found a few tools i thought i was little

00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:35,260
feedback on and heats maps but they were

00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,269
so expensive we realized that we weren't

00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,909
alone so quite a few people we're

00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:41,470
struggling with the same thing so two

00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:43,750
years ago we got together and we decided

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,149
to build to laugh echoes exactly this

00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:48,760
issue and builds this all-in-one

00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:51,190
elastics and feedback platform fights in

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,600
an angular and these are some other

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,610
features we have so we have heat maps

00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,990
that allows you to see visual and

00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,630
overviews of where people are clicking

00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,059
and decide we actually have these are

00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,110
visitor calling so you can see

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:04,419
recordings of users and see where the

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,250
mouse is moving see whether clicking and

00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,690
funnel and I love this so you can see

00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:10,720
where people are dropping off on your

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:12,190
site similar one is forum analysis so we

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,889
can see what's fields in a particular

00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,260
form and making your users stop filling

00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:19,690
that particular form and we also have

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,730
feedback tools so besides the analytic

00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,470
side which where you can actually see

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,539
the visual and understand what they're

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,279
doing can actually ask questions so you

00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:31,360
can trade widgets like this and ask

00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,740
questions in mobile and this and you can

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,299
do something similar with survey so we

00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:36,880
can ask even more questions gets a

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:38,889
little more of your users and finally we

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,149
also have a widget which collects

00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:43,779
details of people who want to become

00:21:40,149 --> 00:21:44,889
your user festers so it's so important

00:21:43,779 --> 00:21:46,090
to you too sir so with this widget you

00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:48,850
can just connect these details and then

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:51,220
contact them and stop either there and

00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,230
let's give you some perspective we

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,090
launched Roger just under two years ago

00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:58,389
and we now we now have almost 200

00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,929
website 200,000 websites using it and to

00:21:58,389 --> 00:22:04,570
put that into context we have over six

00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:06,820
hundred thousand website success in our

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,649
Honda script every single second so you

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,649
can see some numbers we have data that's

00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:14,159
close to 40 terabytes now I'm increasing

00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:14,159
by about five

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,940
and yeah the reason we're here is we're

00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,770
looking for Python developers we think

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,780
it's it's a it's a good opportunity for

00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,660
you to work it's hot job for two prac

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:28,210
reasons you can work remotely so how

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,620
does a completely remotes company we

00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,540
have 19 team members on their based

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,030
around the world so you say for to go to

00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,280
even if you it and so that means you get

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:38,380
flexible hours we give you a home office

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:40,360
budgets are yearly personal budgets

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,490
which can use to buy books for example

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,280
and everyone gets to face with this

00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,650
summit in good but secondly you also get

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,720
to learn new skills so we we encourage

00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:51,640
all developers to learn beyond what they

00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,100
already know so learn more JavaScript

00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,820
learn more angular opposed basic search

00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:00,790
in newark and ultimately our big vision

00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,000
is savage around 10 billion sites now

00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:06,190
this is extremely bold and perhaps it's

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,630
overly ambitious but having such a big

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,460
goal means that we have a lot of

00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:13,720
exciting projects that we want to work

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,100
on i'm divya if any of you want looking

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,110
for a new role and like the idea of

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,480
working with a growing startup and the

00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:24,090

also have a table in the mail thank you

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:34,720
so I would invite Intel and Danny soft

00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:36,870
and but also ask Red Hat team to be

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,870
ready

00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:58,890
hello good afternoon my name is rug

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:01,710
diwani from inter no slides from my side

00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:04,260
no movies you probably know Intel as a

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,800
hardware company right who doesn't know

00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:11,600
intelligible company all right to you

00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:14,340
can come to me later but Intel is also a

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,960
large software company actually it's one

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,510
of the largest software development

00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:21,210
company in the world we have about

00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:24,800
15,000 software developers all around

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:27,750
the world we work on several topics from

00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,150
low-level bias development which is

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:33,060
mainly maybe for you not that

00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:37,230
interesting but also up to machine

00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:41,310
learning big data and and a lot of other

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:43,050
stuff I'm from my side I come from from

00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:45,000
the software side we have a software

00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:48,090
Department there is a real division

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,790
about software and and we love python by

00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:52,170
the way just that you know even if we

00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,820
are interred with love python we only

00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:56,970
have we also have our own software

00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:59,340
python software distribution which we

00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,050
are presenting here so like i said i'm

00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,590
from the software side and we are always

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:09,380
looking at recruiting software

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:13,220
developers we love c++ of course you c++

00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:16,080
assembler sometimes but also python and

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:19,590
so we are currently recruiting a lot of

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,390
people the best is to go actually on the

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:25,140
website because intel is a really big

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:29,460
company so there you can find all the

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:31,950
good job offers worldwide myself i'm

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,080
more on the customer side so if you're

00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:36,360
an engineer and interested to become a

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,240
sales engineer and work with customers

00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,460

happy to to discuss that thank you very

00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,910
much

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:57,950
thanks a lot may I have the Red Hat team

00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:00,370
and I would also suggest scx next team

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,370
to be ready

00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,840
alright so thank you for having us it's

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,760
always a pleasure to be at your python

00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,000
because it's one of the greatest

00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:23,770
conferences for Python in Europe really

00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,049
thanks for your organization seem to put

00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,540
this event together and everybody who

00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:30,820
really made it happen so I guess

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,429
everybody heard of Red Hat was

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:35,710
interesting based on my discussion with

00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:37,750
the people at this conference is that a

00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:40,000
lot of people are associating us only

00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,340
with Linux which is obviously still a

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,650
huge part of what we're doing but these

00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,380
days red hair is a huge portfolio of

00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:49,570
products so the operating system we have

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,910
middleware we have stuff connected with

00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:55,450
the cloud and also move out technologies

00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:56,679
and python is a huge part of what is

00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,010
behind that in terms of programming

00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:03,600
languages and you know some of the tools

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:06,070
within the Linux world in the cloud area

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,950
organization are all written in Python

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,929
we also use Python for automation so

00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,270
it's also huge part of our quality

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:15,400
engineering department so what is so

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:18,340
cool about working for red hat as a

00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,440
technology person I would say that the

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,750
open source is a huge part of that so

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,900
when you're working at red heads you're

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:28,540
not only like or your work is not only

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:30,549
visible within the team and within the

00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:33,250
company but they're also interacting

00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:35,980
with people out there people in the

00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:38,200
upstream also these days were facing

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,750
like interesting challenges because of

00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,490
the size of the portfolio so our

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,100
products are obviously talking to each

00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,299
other which means that we are working

00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,950
off with like continuous integration and

00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,679
really making it easier for our

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,610
customers to deploy the code as far as

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,280
fast as possible so we have offices all

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,990
around the world we are a global company

00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:03,580
we came from Brno from the Czech

00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,919
Republic were the largest engineering

00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:09,400
offices at the moment so it's like more

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,870
than thousand people and we're not only

00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,299
hiring in the Czech Republic but we're

00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:15,160
hiring also remote ease especially for

00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:17,230
teams like OpenStack and virtualization

00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,910
you can work remotely from anywhere

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,960
around Europe so if you're interested

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,940

00:31:00,749 --> 00:31:03,859
meeting to be really

00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,570
hi my name is Toby I'm an engineer from

00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:31,330
travelpod we're a small start-up in

00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:34,960
barcelona that's offering a free service

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:37,090
for companies to build a book and manage

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,220
the the whole cycle of business travel

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:41,530
you know how in companies normally when

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:43,150
people try to make a book for a trip

00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:45,160
it's complex because you have to book

00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,870
flights on somewhere then you have to

00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,880
and search hotel somewhere else then you

00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:51,610
have to grab all the invoices send them

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,380
to to the invoicing center try to get

00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:55,929
the expenses but we try to we are

00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,669
building a tool that allows to the

00:31:55,929 --> 00:32:00,880
companies to manage the whole cycle in

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:03,370
one place so we offer like for example a

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,230
user directory with user policies so for

00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,120
example one user can only fly in

00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,669
business because reasons and all user

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:11,440
just can fly in economy and then get

00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:13,809
four star hotels and because these are

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,330
user is a very bad person just get cheap

00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:18,940
hostels so we manage this thing and also

00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:21,100
you research and boob for flights and

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,049
hotels in or another platform also in

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,030
Boise them so the companies have a

00:32:23,049 --> 00:32:28,059
central point where can manage the whole

00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:29,710
business trip in one place so we as I

00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:33,100
told we're sorry we're a small company

00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:34,870
Barcelona and we do not or technology

00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,630
stack is built around in on the front

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:39,400
and side in react Diaz JavaScript sorry

00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:41,890
and on the back inside we're using

00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,140
Python with generous framework postgres

00:32:41,890 --> 00:32:45,910
salary all the standard tools to

00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:49,390
integrate with the different providers

00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,400
that provide us flights hotels payment

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:53,110
services so we all read this thing on

00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:55,570
the back end and the front end consumers

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,540
as I told you we're a small company in

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:00,309
Barcelona we are like around 20 people

00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:03,040
from 10 types of different nationalities

00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:06,429
so we had international team very young

00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:10,419

think we succeed to connect people with

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:49,110
great local businesses focusing on the

00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:50,580
word great we do have reviews on the

00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,990

features so we help you to find a good

00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,470
business somebody where you're happy to

give your money to and where you are

00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:04,080
satisfied with the service afterwards

00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:06,230
this is how the website looks like this

00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:08,400
is actually like our highest traffic

00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:12,510
page on the side it's the single

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,450
business page we are also active in the

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:19,020
mobile space we have some great Android

00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:22,500
and iOS apps you can see them here we're

00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:26,220
trying to show you bilbao we are active

00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:27,630
in 32 countries we have you can see the

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:33,840
numbers there I don't have to read them

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:36,300
for you we do operate at scale so we

00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,640
have some interesting problems for you

00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:41,550
to solve when you work at Yelp where

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,380
have three offices in Europe in Germany

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:47,040
and Hamburg which is the second largest

00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:50,730
city of Germany Dublin where it's mostly

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,650
sales and Blunden so for you engineers

00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:55,410
the interesting officers will be in

00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:57,900
London where we have about 25 engineers

00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:59,280
and in Hamburg where we have about 40

00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:02,280
people working in product and

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,430
engineering meaning that while at Yelp

00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:08,940
we are a company that worldwide has over

00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:10,890
400 engineers we still have this what I

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,780
consider the sweet spot of number of

00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,490
people in our offices in Europe where

00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:16,160
you still know everybody you greet

00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:19,410
everybody when you come into the office

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:25,020
but you can still work on large problems

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:28,590
and have a real impact what we're

00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,420
looking for these are the jobs you can

00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:34,320
read it for yourself check out our

00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:36,990
website if you are not finding what

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,840
you're looking for exactly please come

00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:41,550

sure we'll find a solution we are always

00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:44,990
looking for passionate

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,059
people and we have a diverse set of

00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:50,960
problems to solve so I'm sure we can

00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:52,720
work something out what we offer the

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,369
usual I think that's more or less

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,920
standard let me talk a bit about the

00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:59,690
technologies we use most of the things

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,809
you hear about here at Europe iphone

00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:04,940
will be using it we have a large

00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:07,520
service-oriented architecture with

00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,799
hundreds of services in production we

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,880
ship co2 production multiple times a day

00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:15,799
by engineers we have our platform as a

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:18,440

source contributor and one thing I want

00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:27,530
to point out is that I think I really

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,619
think it can make an impact at Yelp as

00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:33,290
an engineer there's no like strong

00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:36,470
hierarchies we value everyone you can

00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:41,660

my colleagues do this

00:42:54,010 --> 00:43:00,190
working in binary Barcelona it's almost

00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:03,390
like working in a developer Island it

00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:03,390
feels like being your own boss

00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,570
the thing I like the most about binder

00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,330
is the constant challenges that we face

00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:19,520
and also the fun that comes with it

00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:22,520
which is of course made by the great

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,230
thing that we have in Barcelona building

00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:27,940
we ended up for binder is pretty cool

00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:27,940
and the collection cool

00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,350
you

00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:37,740
for me the best is when the weather is

00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,420
nice which is almost all the times you

00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,040
can go outside i'm having some lines

00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,030

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,030
lovely

00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:54,790

in the very center of the city there are

00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,320
many things to do around here

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,950
also if you need to relax and clear your

00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:09,560
mind you can play video games football

00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:09,560
