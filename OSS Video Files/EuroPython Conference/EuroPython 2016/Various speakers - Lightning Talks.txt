alright coming everyone lightning talks

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,130
dark at five o'clock the best place to

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,690
sit for the lightning talks is right up

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,220
at the front especially if you're a

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,840
speaker if you're a speaker in the

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,370
lightning talks I definitely need you up

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,599
at the front if you're not a speaker

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,740
there's still room at the front or the

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,740

hey hey hey someone's going to get

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:31,590
bumped off the list that's great we've

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,150
got loads of lightning talks for you

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,680
stay all right come closer to the front

00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,210
everyone if you just walked in there's

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,110
loads of room up at the front when

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,880
you're close to the front you can see

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,380
better the person giving the lightning

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,060
talk feels like you're more engaged and

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,009
more curious about what they have to say

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,750
it makes them happy a happy speaker

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,040
delivers a better talk and a better talk

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,360
informs you more and makes you more

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,009
happy in a virtual ouroboros circle of

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,630
knowledge transmission passion community

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,829
and fun come close to the front

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,829
basically is what I'm saying

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,929
yeah that person is right if you close

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,209
the display settings app that little

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:17,970
warning will go away or we can leave it

00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:20,069
I hope I don't know lightning talks are

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,269
a succession of torques interspersed

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:24,950
with people heckling from the audience

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:24,950
about how to fix your display settings

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,349
come on lots of room near the front

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,700
everyone the front is the best place to

00:02:31,349 --> 00:02:34,170
be for the lightning talks anywhere you

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,599
get to see more you get to learn more

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,459
you get to feel more the whole thing is

00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,090
more engaging the day ends on a high

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:45,150
note you go home happy and and the whole

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:46,590
conference turns into way better value

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,090
for money which we can't possibly argue

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,860
with come up to the front come up to the

00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,360
front lots of room at the front also a

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,920
bit of room here in the middle in a

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,390
little enclaves behind the camera man

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:58,860
that's probably because people don't

00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,150
want to sit behind the camera okay i'm

00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,640
looking at a camera i wanted to look at

00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,530
a talk come on in we're going to start

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,670
in about one minute so there's no a lot

00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,810
of time now if you're gonna come to the

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,299
front it's right up here come on walk

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,590
walk walk walk walk walk walk fast and

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,590
safely towards the front

00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,460
right now we don't start until exactly

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,930
the time you you can notice not my

00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:29,970
warranty my watch is the only watch that

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:31,560
matters did it dip dare you can start

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:33,030
heckling me when the official lightning

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:48,210
talks have started but it's not fair to

00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:49,980
do that before get out you hi okay we're

00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,900
about to start so if you're now walking

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:55,410
in I need you to start walking in much

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,690
more quietly so tiptoe to your seat from

00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:59,310
now on as we're about to start same

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,840
lightning talk rules as Harold one hand

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,520
for Littlefinger collapse two hands for

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,750
final collapse you have up to five

00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,460
minutes you don't have to use the whole

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,460
five minutes cost take it away

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:18,299
thanks everyone can you hear me okay I'm

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,120
cursed ranchers I'm here to raise

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:24,360
awareness for a open source project that

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,370
we developed it's called bigquery and

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,259
asking I want to use these minutes to

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,060
explain what it does why it's really

00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:34,070
nice and I think more people should be

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,740
aware of it and possibly use it i

00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,509
confide my company three years ago and

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,340
we started and we had some problems

00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:44,100
which we had actually clients from the

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:47,190
start there were retailers with billions

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,590
of records of data but we were hardly

00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,199
any money and we still had to need to be

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,710
able to respond to that so we had this

00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,830
technical issue that we had to address

00:04:54,710 --> 00:05:01,620
and that's how big way in the end came

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,620
to life to various other parts in

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,570
between what does he do it basically it

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,220
runs everything what you see here in the

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,590
back I have actually something like 20

00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:15,539
20 million records in the back and it

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,680
runs through it it aggregates basically

00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:23,370
on the backend and makes it possible for

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:28,260
us to very very efficient in terms of

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:31,110
aggregation and reporting so this base

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:36,090
what's a big query does and she saw it's

00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:39,030
the front end is HTML it was our client

00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:42,630
use and the whole entire back end is

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:44,940
basically fightin so that's what we do

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,880
there it's part of a large part is what

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,590
which always also outsource later on but

00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,409
in the start I want to start with

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:55,380
bigquery why did you make it there are

00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:57,720
several solutions out there like of

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,669
course Hadoop and spark did not exist

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,740
three years ago yet but there are other

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,720
solutions but especially it's a very

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,699
small start-up they are very hard to

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:11,010
administrate they could be very

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:11,970
expensive use a lot of resources and at

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,250
the same time there were more

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,560
technological developments in the

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,260
background I think the lowe's rose the

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,779
most important one what you see actually

00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:25,300
with MongoDB wire tiger and the moving

00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:27,710
towards compressed on the

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,560
saving as also was happening in the

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,660
fight community because of these two men

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,330
here who made because unfortunately

00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:37,250
they're not here at the moment but they

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:39,770
have also helped us a lot really great

00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,540
cracks and what because is it's

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,449
basically compressed data container so

00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,460
it takes data puts it compressed on this

00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:49,250
which means that it's sense it's zipped

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,860
to your CPU it unzips it there and the

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,080
idea is that modern CPUs are so quick

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,780
that you actually overcome the memory

00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,650
bandwidth issue and are nearly as quick

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:02,270
as it will be in memory and that's

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,130
actually true the only problem with

00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,930
because is that it does not aggregate

00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:09,220
anything it's basically bare-bones

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,800
framework for compressed data and for

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:15,380
reading and writing that compressed data

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:17,030
so that's where we made big query we

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,200
query it's basically on top of pickles

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,510
and it makes you this is our post the

00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,430
slides on SlideShare so you can read

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,669
this later on but basically it does its

00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,100
application framework and its water fast

00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,930
so we have comparisons with upon those

00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,560
for instance also compared two bundles

00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:39,050
in memory it's like 1.5 to 2.5 more time

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,120
slower that's of course comparing your

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,570
own disk aggregations compared to a

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,870
bundle stuff there's also the sources

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,990
are down there there's some examples of

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,450
a New York taxi data set which does

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,950
where you can see basically it's being

00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:57,590
spread of a Hadoop cluster of eight

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,599
machines with third gigabyte per machine

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:02,120
eight processors etc and what it

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:07,010
basically does and now I hope it skills

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:10,970
will but what it does is of my own quad

00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:13,940
core machine now is doing in 1.8 seconds

00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:16,760
it does that in 0.5 seconds with the

00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,800
same eight machines in which you pop

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,500
what you cannot see at the moment but it

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:25,820
uses less than 1 gigabyte of memory and

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:29,090
runs this fast on my own laptop so

00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:33,620
that's basically what I photos may be

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:36,229
interesting for more people and it's in

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,830
it's downloadable only if you have 58 it

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:38,240
won't work

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:40,100
at the moment because of some strange

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,440
reason if your pip set and you can still

00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,470
install it otherwise from the source

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,280
from github directly we're still working

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:52,190
on it but here of course free to look at

00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:55,460
it and also join the project if you want

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,140
to yeah so that's best my short

00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,550
introduction of bigquery what it does

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,550
any questions

00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:17,870
thanks very much next is found Oh God

00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:25,360
how's everyone enjoying that conference

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:32,810
so far it's it's cheap but it works man

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:34,850
like a free whoop just do are you ready

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:41,900
to go fondo without further ado fan of

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:46,370
Allah him a big hand thank you so raise

00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:48,950
your hand if you use butylene right a

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,680
lot of people built rims are awesome

00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:53,630
right I mean you have a lot of benefits

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,830
you have you can install whatever you

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:59,050
want without making dirty or

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:01,130
installation and you can reproduce

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:04,850
environments from one computer to the

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:07,130
other etc etc etc we I am I don't want

00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,050
to sell you built lens what is the

00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:11,660
problem with will two lamps we need to

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:14,180
manage them manually so it's not a

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,680
problem really for when you're hungry

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,600
when you're working in a big project

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,330
because you enter in the virtual em and

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,510
you are there eight hours but what we do

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:27,589
you do for the scripts you have 35

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:30,350
scripts in your computer and do you do

00:10:27,589 --> 00:10:33,470
you install the dependencies in one beer

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:37,510
column for all the 35 scripts or you

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:40,880
have 35 billions one for each script and

00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,790
you have to remember which built roland

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,980
was before executing the script and

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:48,020
remember to enter the virtual em before

00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,210
executing the script getting out of

00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,100
there inspector in entering etcetera

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,420
etcetera what do you do in that case

00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:59,360
it's a problem it's a mess so faith is

00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:02,030
here to help us with phase it's very

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,160
simple you only indicate the

00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,710
dependencies that is all you care about

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:09,770
you you care about your script under

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:13,480
dependencies you only need to tell the

00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:16,610
dependencies executed and nothing else

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:19,550
how you execute it well very simple as

00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:20,560
any other script we're calling it with

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,070
fades

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,500
or put faith in the Shiva or even as a

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,630
Python module if you want you can call

00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:32,170
it and you can execute with your script

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,510
and you only need to do is specify the

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:37,779
dependencies how do you specify the

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:40,930
dependencies well it's very easy so for

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:43,360
example if you want to use a script in a

00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:46,510
virtual em that have requests you just

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,900
call phase dash D requests and faiths

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,870
will execute your script in a virtual em

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:56,020
that only has request installing it if

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,180
you call this this if you are in a clean

00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,400
machine it will create a virtual them it

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:03,460
will install request calling peep at

00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,529
cetera and executor script there the

00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,380
second time you do it it will be super

00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:10,960
fast because it already has ever tell em

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,630
with requesting tall if you want to

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,450
execute another script with only request

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:20,350
it already has the vellum is only to you

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:24,070
don't need to care about anything if you

00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:27,750
call face does the your dependency and

00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:30,280
don't specify scrip it opens for you a

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,010
interactive interpreter this is the

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,500
quickest and easiest way to try a new

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:38,260
library do you try this library no I

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:40,839
didn't off a stash the library and you

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,750
have an interpreter and you have that

00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:46,510
interpret that lives inside the vault

00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:48,339
ahlam with that dependency stall and you

00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,070
just try it you don't need to do

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,530
anything else if you like to use ipython

00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:56,530
you should tell it to use a Python if

00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:58,300
you want to use any specific Python

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,130
version you should tell it to use and

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:03,730
its place in a specific Python version

00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:06,940
if you have several dependencies you

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:10,030
just call dash D several times if you

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:12,220
have I know I know if you have to put a

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,430
one of the dependency or several of the

00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:17,470
dependencies in a specific version or

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:20,170
greater than or less than whatever you

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,320
just specified if you have a requirement

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:27,490
dot txt a text you have tell it with

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:30,400
dash L so that were that were the simple

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,830
one let's level up the simple ways to

00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,180
work with the script is this one you

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,220
have your script you

00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,980
good faith in the shebang and how do you

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:42,490
specify the dependencies see that magic

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,460
commentary fails in the import faiths

00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,680
will execute this script in a virtual m

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,560
that only has request installed because

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,870
you tell it through a commentary you can

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,000
tell the commentary in several ways you

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:58,720
can put it in the doc string you can put

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,050
it in the face shebang line etc there

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,399
are several ways for example another

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:10,330
another complicated task to start a pile

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,010
angle project with a version of the

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,200
angle that you don't have installed in

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,300
your system how do you do that well with

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,360
face it's easy because you call fate

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:22,720
telling it the dependencies angle one

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,810
day and with dash X you execute

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,970
something inside the will to them so you

00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,430
are executing the young one min of the

00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,350
version from the ville column and this

00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:35,230
way you can start the jungle project in

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,290
that specific version and also if for

00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,810
example you can if you have a specific

00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:42,910
pic requirement because you have a proxy

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,380
or whatever you can also tell it fed to

00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:50,050
face that to to teach people how to work

00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,540
so keep calm and use face you can

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:54,640
install it very easily if you it's

00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,670
already in debian it's already in 12

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,589
it's really not you install it and use

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,180
it and no more before them manually

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:03,180
handling thank you very much

00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:10,259
all right come on in there's still a few

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,180
people coming in everyone so make some

00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,440
space at the end of the rows if you spot

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:15,540
their space in the middle of the row

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,889
everyone moved two seats towards the

00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,810
spaces make it so that people can

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:21,000
actually come in make yourselves helpful

00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,350
there there you go that's one space

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,540
liber de ribber ated there that's

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,920
fantastic there's loads of people

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,560
sitting down at the back of the room

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,810
they could easily be given a bit more oh

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:36,600
my god the power everyone is doing what

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:39,649

everyone so my name is Paul hallett um

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,800
does anyone here use Django yep does

00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:15,000
anyone know that the Django Software

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,720
Foundation has a code of conduct

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,579
committee few people ok so I'm a member

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,620
of the Django software foundation code

00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:23,939
of conduct committee I call it just the

00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:27,300
code of conduct committee from now on

00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:28,740
and I have an announcement to share from

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,480
Django and the Code of Conduct committee

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,100
today but for those of you who didn't

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,980
put your hand up to a little bit about

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,660
what we do pretty simply we are

00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,149
responsible for making sure that Django

00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,399
community provides a harassment free

00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:44,100
experience for everyone involved we have

00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:46,380
members that are global and

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,370
representative of you the communities

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,680
we've got people from different

00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,569
backgrounds of different experiences and

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,029
as I said we have something quite big to

00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:57,060
pronounce today and that's our code of

00:16:54,029 --> 00:16:58,800
conduct documentation this isn't the

00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,850
Django code of conduct I'm sure you're

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,560
all aware if you've ever been to a

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,899
django conference that we do have a code

00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,610
of conduct but this is documentation on

00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:08,039
how we actually deal with the processes

00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,959
of receiving issues and making sure that

00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:13,439
the Django community is friendly and

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,929
safe and inviting and before I get into

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,829
why we decided to open source this I

00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:19,059
want to tell you a bit a little bit

00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:21,399
about what's involved

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:23,499
the first section is about membership

00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:26,589
how we elect members how members can

00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:30,159
maintain their status we are trying to

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:32,019
promote like a non burnout style

00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:33,639
membership so people opt in and they say

00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:35,019
I'd love to be partners for six months

00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:38,049
and then after that they have no

00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:39,629
obligation to stay we also have the most

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:42,519
important part which is how we handle

00:17:39,629 --> 00:17:44,289
reports we take each report as seriously

00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:47,139
as the next one and the previous one and

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:48,340
we have processes with exactly how we go

00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:50,080
through this so people who feel like

00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,119
they're uncertain about making reports

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,100
can see the exact processes we go

00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,110
through to make sure that we handle

00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,320
those issues seriously and justly and

00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,480
fairly we also mention how we keep

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,399
records of reports there's no point in

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,039
us actually running this committee if we

00:18:03,399 --> 00:18:07,720
aren't able to collaborate with Django

00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:10,090
organizers and other organizers of

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,179
Python events if we don't keep a record

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:16,049
of those reports and that includes some

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:18,669
processes around a normalization as well

00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:20,409
you may not realize this not many people

00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:22,090
put the handoff that actually knew we

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:23,200
had a committee so you very few people

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,690
we even realize this that we actually

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,869
work with the organizers of every single

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:31,240
official Django conference to make sure

00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:32,919
that we share reports between them so

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,779
they share with us the attendee list and

00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:38,950
they if there's any reports were able to

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:40,389
share them with other communities and

00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,059
finally you can also find our

00:18:40,389 --> 00:18:45,009
transparency in statistics there this is

00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,299
this is the actual like figures of the

00:18:45,009 --> 00:18:48,340
number of reports we've received over

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:51,220
the past two years as you can see we've

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:52,659
gone from 11 2 years ago to seven so far

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:54,309
this year so hopefully we'll be able to

00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:56,019
bring that down and ultimately make

00:18:54,309 --> 00:18:58,899
ourselves redundant and make the

00:18:56,019 --> 00:19:00,820
community friendly and inviting the

00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:02,499
reason we did this there's three reasons

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:04,539
the first one is obviously to help hold

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:06,720
ourselves accountable to you to make

00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,710
sure that we're providing this safe

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,179
environment for people and also to let

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,879
you understand how we make these

00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:15,610
decisions the second reason which is

00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:17,950
closest to my heart is to help other

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:20,169
tech communities who have not been able

00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,029
to adopt a code of conduct to show them

00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:23,950
that you can do this safely you can do

00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,110
it fairly that we don't witch hunt this

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:28,929
is actually done a very depth through a

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:30,639
very democratic process and finally need

00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:32,470
to get feedback from you to understand

00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:33,020
if we're doing a good enough job if

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,900
we're making

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,190
it more well understood and generated to

00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,040
get your feedback on how we can run this

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,590
better so big shout out to these people

00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,330
are the reason my name here isn't

00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,760
because I'm pretentious actually it's

00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:48,710
because all uh Satara wrote these slides

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,630
and she's announcing this exact same

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,510
lightning talk right now in Philadelphia

00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:56,300
in the USA at jangan con us so we're

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,100
launching this right the second so it's

00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,360
there go and have a look give us your

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,900
feedback and I look forward to hearing

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,900
it thank

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:15,880
all right who wants to hear a story

00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:18,070
about a squirrel I I tried to I thought

00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,690
you know we could just do jokes but I

00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:21,610
haven't actually got any new ones in

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:23,500
last year so instead I've got a funny

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,720
story about a squirrel then I try and

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,919
read in an entertaining manner and it

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,620
starts off but we're not going to have

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,360
it for long I never dreamed slowly

00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,639
cruising on a motorcycle through a

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,860
residential neighborhood could be so

00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:38,620
incredibly dangerous little did I

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:42,690
suspect dot dot dot that's your intro

00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,690
let's move on to star wars word clouds

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:53,500
hi everyone I'm Raphael this is a fun

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,210
project that i recently worked on why

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,950
just because i like star wars and i like

00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,139
to play around with data so i thought it

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,519
was a good idea i also think that you

00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:03,070
know these very small projects are a

00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,350
neat way to just explore basic data

00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:08,649
science concepts and and the

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:11,529
capabilities of Python libraries so in

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:13,779
particular i saw i guess this i just

00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:16,809
want to encourage maybe newcomers to a

00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:19,330
python or to data science to do

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:21,850
something similar in particular i wanted

00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,440
to test this library which is the word

00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:26,139
cloud library i don't know if you know

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,129
it this is from anti-earth mula if you

00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:32,860
don't then check it out and so the first

00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:34,480
step that I did was of course to get

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:38,159
some data for this I went to this

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,799
webpage which is basically the database

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,720
which contains movie scripts and this is

00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:46,450
a partial screenshot of how this looks

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,220
like of course what we need to do here

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:51,129
is extract data that is actually being

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:54,279
spoken by the people because we want to

00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:56,019
create word clouds from Star Wars

00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,980
characters so with a bit of

00:21:56,019 --> 00:22:03,639
introspection of the HTML and the help

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,610
of a beautiful soup we can just parse

00:22:03,639 --> 00:22:09,759
the HTML this is an example code 4

00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:13,149
episode 5 and you hope so we basically

00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:16,720
get the HTML using request parse it

00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:18,820
using beautiful soup and then we iterate

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,559
over it extract the code for each

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,720
character

00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,789
that is being spoken and then we end up

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,299
with dictionary where basically the keys

00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:29,429
are the character names and the values

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:31,440
are the strings of the text that they

00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:35,129
that they spoke I'm not going to go into

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:39,659
details here this is an example output

00:22:35,129 --> 00:22:41,759
of darth veda from episode 4 as you see

00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:45,360
this is RO text so the next step is

00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,580
basically to go ahead and clean this by

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,059
basically doing things like removing

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,730
punctuation clean removing stop words

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:57,990
for instance lower casing it you do this

00:22:53,730 --> 00:23:00,960
for each character across all episodes

00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:03,360
and then you end up with something like

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,639
this which is a nice string of just

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,200
words again the example of Darth Vader

00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:12,659
there's bits and pieces that you still

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,970
need to do like you know merge a

00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,799
dictionary entries that you know the

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:20,549
same character like Luke and Luke's

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:24,210
voice or c-3po and Threepio stuff like

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:28,139
that and this is the list of the top

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:31,200
list of the characters by word counts

00:23:28,139 --> 00:23:34,110
and then we're ready to create the our

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,309
workouts for that it's as easy as

00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:41,369
instantiated this this word cloud class

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:44,279
with basically a list of words and their

00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:51,740
frequencies and so let's play a game

00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:56,070
who's this come on let's Luke of course

00:23:51,740 --> 00:24:03,029
who's this that's easy Threepio exactly

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:05,759
what about that one someone said Yoda

00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:08,840
right that's y ahora well now an easy

00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:14,749
one easy one this one

00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:17,759
right and so low okay last one with this

00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:22,740
of course our all-time favorite

00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:27,389
character Star Wars exactly so what we

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:31,259
can do is basically do we can also pass

00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:34,499
for instance image masks to this library

00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:37,619
and create a more beautiful stuff so we

00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:43,279
come up with something like this you

00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:47,369
recognize this juicio de this is Padme

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,980
that is OB van and of course that Vader

00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:52,169
and of course this is just the beginning

00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,690
there's a lot of more you can do with

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,690
this data for instance use tf-idf

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,039
instead of just word frequencies apply

00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:01,289
machine learning you know try to

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:04,230
classify may be dark and bright side

00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:06,360
whatever and do some network analysis of

00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:09,749
the interconnectivity of the different

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:11,909
characters in the movies i am new cortex

00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:15,360
and github if you want to check the

00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:17,720
notebook it's it's here star it forked

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,009
loan it run it whatever you like and

00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:22,009
thanks a lot for your attention

00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:32,120
alright Meg it depend facts all next and

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,680
then Chris Young stefanescu Christian

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,830
are you here all right you're ready to

00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,420
run up after Christian will have

00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:44,360
jonathans lenders John at Jonathan here

00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:46,340
very good I was on Bryce Street a very

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,670
nice neighborhood with perfect lawns and

00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:51,770
slow traffic as I passed an oncoming car

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:53,510
the brown furry missile shot out from

00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:56,090
under it and tumbled to a stop

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,790
immediately in front of me it was a

00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,230
squirrel and he must have been trying to

00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,360
run across the road when it encountered

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,920
the car I really was not going very fast

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,930
and there was no time to break or avoid

00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:07,760
it it was that close I hate to run over

00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:10,160
animals and I really hate it on a

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,970
motorcycle but a squirrel should pose no

00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:17,080
danger to me I barely had time to brace

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:20,120
for the impact animal lovers never fear

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:23,090
squirrels I discovered can take care of

00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,240
themselves are you ready yeah give a big

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,240
cat

00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:34,049
thanks a lot and rely was perfect cool

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,369
so I built a little app over the last

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:37,980
couple of days and i thought i'd show

00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:40,379
show you over here I actually bit the

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,509
bascom it in seven minutes ago so I'm

00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:48,619
not seen if that works but hopefully it

00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:51,179
will um so this light is kind of a

00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:53,190
multi-device site so what one it is a

00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:59,489
gal your phones and stuff and visit this

00:26:53,190 --> 00:27:00,960
URL which is e upy $16 oh crap calm and

00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:02,519
we can see this device count we happened

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,700
this is a tiny little flasks app is

00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:08,070
using our service which i won't talk

00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,139
about just now and so we're getting 21

00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:13,169
ish devices as going up and down it's

00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:14,220
kind of weird and yeah what you should

00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:18,090
see as you should see this kind of

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:19,950
grayed out logo and what this tool that

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:23,519
I've hired together is is basically a

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,109
kind of global designer I think so what

00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:29,519
we can do is each of our devices is

00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:31,679
connected to this flask app and through

00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,419
arc and it infrastructure and I can send

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,519
out messages so basically let's choose

00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:40,440
the first color of this logo so let's

00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:44,159
choose green whoo cool so that kind of

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:47,309
works which is good wasn't totally sure

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,070
about that and yeah we can choose these

00:27:47,309 --> 00:27:51,960
other colors as well so maybe green and

00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:58,499
blue and you should see that updating on

00:27:51,960 --> 00:28:00,659
your phones and laptops I put some

00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:03,899
buttons down the bottom which I emoji in

00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:06,359
them so the first emoji this chooses a

00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,769
random color scheme for those two things

00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:09,629
so you should see a different color

00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,549
scheme for each of your from your

00:28:09,629 --> 00:28:13,679
neighbors and i can press this a few

00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:18,450
times you can get some some new ones new

00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:20,129
ideas for for your logos right this

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:25,730
speaker button wide like you just prop

00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:25,730
the volumes on your on your devices

00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:34,730
cool you'll get more of that okay so

00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,340
this is using the Web Audio API to

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:40,460
synthesize a note that's randomly chosen

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,440
on your device right okay slightly

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:44,510
linked to last the last talk we're going

00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,059
to make this a bit more real we're going

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:50,360
to use these to choosing colors and

00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:53,890
sounds to select a winner okay and the

00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,890
thing you're going to win is this bb-8

00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:02,850
so what's going to happen is everyone's

00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,350
phones are going to change colors and

00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:05,730
they're going to play notes and they're

00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:08,070
going to get a bit more kind of chaotic

00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:10,890
and then eventually one person will have

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:12,420
the kind of like the proper local colors

00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,150
Evan also have grave and that person

00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,410
will have one so if you hold up your

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,970
phones and turn them to the center of

00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:20,700
the room that we don't make it kind of

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:30,230
cool right so is everyone ready for this

00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:30,230
Oh gravure cool so let's start listening

00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:38,070
is this gonna finish before the heat

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:43,860
death of the universe just have you

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:46,250
tried 40 sec okay okay go see it's kind

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,250
of in time

00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,540
please wait long

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,910
any one winner

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,470
and Boop

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:44,740
so thanks a lot for that and we're gonna

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:46,149
have a session tomorrow at lunchtime if

00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,149
you're interested show how we build this

00:30:46,149 --> 00:31:01,390
but or whatever HAP lunge thank you very

00:30:49,149 --> 00:31:02,590
much thank you taste young one of the

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,500
organizers there did you want to say

00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:07,679
something Fabio did you want to say

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:11,080
something I saw you creeping up now ok

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,840
you have a talk that's even better there

00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:22,690
ya are you just ready to go Christian

00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:24,850
yeah I'm then taken away first of all

00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,860
sorry I'm super nervous i usually don't

00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:31,480
speak more in front of more than you

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:35,350
know three people my name is on the

00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:37,570
slides and this is nameko nameko is

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,299
Japanese word I looked it up it

00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:44,500
basically is a fungus which you use to

00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:46,210
make miso soup so I'm sorry I pretty

00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,890
much gave it all the way I'm probably

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:52,270
you know I'm going to talk about the

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:57,070
micro service framework yeah so a bit of

00:31:52,270 --> 00:32:00,220
background we had in our company a big

00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,870
change in which we decided to go for you

00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,049
know the fancy stuff you bill today an

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,390
API and some micro services and then we

00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:10,480
were looking around for the fitting

00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:13,360
framework to build our micro services

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,760
and we found nameko and although I'm

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,799
quite nervous still I hope I can convey

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,409
some of the excitement I had when I

00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:25,270
found lamico so no miko can do I pc or

00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:30,159
event-based kind of communication I'm

00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:32,830
going into these patterns in more depth

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,850
soon if you don't know what that means

00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:40,840
it uses event let under the hood for a

00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:45,669
sink worker handling it uses dependency

00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:48,970
injection and it uses it for so called

00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:50,950
dependency providers these are all sorts

00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:54,330
of things you can plug in to

00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:57,159
you're namiko services like vlogging or

00:32:54,330 --> 00:33:03,010
think of it like some sort of middleware

00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:05,799
and then it uses extensions and it uses

00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:09,549
extensions for instance to define the

00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:12,039
protocols to transport messages so let's

00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:16,990
look at RPC calls and this is the main

00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:19,570
part we're using a micro for okay so i

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,760
already said microservices so in the

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:25,200
grand scheme of things there's a method

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,760
somewhere out there on the internet

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,820
probably in some sort of service which I

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,250
want to call and I'd like my code to be

00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:36,730
nice and readable and this is actually

00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,620
doable with nameko so this is this could

00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:42,760
be the code you could be writing

00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:45,960
tomorrow under the hood in the middle

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:49,059
error let's think of nameko as or

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:52,480
actually nameko does this its you

00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:56,980
realizes your call to Jason sends it

00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,610
over rabbitmq let's c mq p protocol

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:03,190
implementation and calls the service

00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:07,990
then creates a new queue which will hold

00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:11,679
the result and returns it so that's it

00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:14,379
for our pc now let's look at the code

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,589
and this is the part I like the most I

00:34:14,379 --> 00:34:20,290
think this is just a class and this is

00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:22,950
just a method and I think the only thing

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:27,240
that's kind of unusual besides the

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:31,659
import of some fungus is the decorator

00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:34,659
at RPC which transforms this plane

00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:41,349
Python method into something that

00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:43,690
actually works remotely I was thinking

00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:46,260
about the parallel to Java but I quickly

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:50,829
dropped it so Java developers called

00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:54,280
pojos or so called plain plain old java

00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:55,830
objects but i think this doesn't work

00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,480
for not

00:34:55,830 --> 00:35:03,070
so anyway it's a simple python class and

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,320
if you're like me and you like testing

00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:08,020
you probably like this as well look at

00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:12,000
how nicely the method doesn't contain

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:16,960
anything about the transport okay now

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:21,250
for the RPC part I also like the tooling

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,260
a lot in the upper left corner we have a

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,110
helper I can call from the command line

00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:29,410
which will run my service it will bring

00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:32,140
it up and I can start calling it from

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:35,320
and let's the the part in the bottom

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:37,600
right a shell so this is basically a

00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,790
basically a Python show which is

00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:45,010
configured to talk to this said service

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:47,650
so interaction is is quite fast and you

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,630
can test stuff and you can also use this

00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:53,140
introduction to talk to your services in

00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:55,780
production now I said events are also

00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:57,930
possible so for the scenario I have an

00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:00,250
event handlers somewhere in my service i

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:02,560
can write this kind of code i

00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:08,290
instantiate an event dispatcher and send

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:13,570
it a hello and i also can pass a payload

00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:16,120
and then yeah sorry there's no response

00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,950
of course i'm just sending i'm just

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:21,670
sending the event let's look at the code

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:25,660
again again the the import is missing

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:27,550
also but the decorator is the only thing

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:31,390
that distinguishes it from a simple

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:34,390
python class there are three types of

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:37,000
event handlers I'm going to put them all

00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:39,070
there so you can see them so maybe

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:42,880
singleton is the easiest one you want

00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:46,540
exactly ones delivery broadcast means

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:50,800
you reach all and a service pool is

00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:56,100
actually just one out of a cluster of

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,100
services it can do HTTP but I wouldn't

00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:05,900
thank you very much that was Chris

00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,880
Gianna my god Jonathan coming up on

00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:13,850
stage fantastic after that it will be

00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:15,650
Matias 5am inches before the impact the

00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,720
squirrel flipped to his feet he was

00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:20,300
standing on his hind legs and facing my

00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,280
oncoming victory cross county tour with

00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,500
steadfast resolve in his beady little

00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,900
eyes his mouth opened at the last

00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,490
possible moment he screamed and leap I'm

00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,670
pretty sure the scream was squirrel four

00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:34,250
bands I or maybe die you gravy sucking

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:37,040
heathen scum the leap was nothing short

00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:38,600
of spectacular he shot straight up flew

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,670
over my windshield and impacted me

00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,350
squarely in the chest instantly he said

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:44,150
upon me if I did not know better I'd a

00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,890
thorn in sworn he brought 20 of his

00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,900
little buddies along for the attack

00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,060
snarling hissing and tearing up my

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,700
clothes he was a friendly of a frenzy of

00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,650
activity a frenzy of activity very much

00:37:52,700 --> 00:38:00,200
like Jonathan who will give us a short

00:37:54,650 --> 00:38:04,880
lightning talk about prom toolkit thank

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:07,670
you so this is very short presentation

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,860
about prom tickets which is a library

00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,960
for building common plant applications

00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,070
and fightin white with a very strong

00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:18,410
focus on usability so for that we go

00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:21,740
back to the normal writing she'll just

00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:23,360
to have a short emo so let's start a

00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:26,090
Python shell and do some pipe encoding

00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,370
so for instance we can do an f-test and

00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:31,520
I'm prints hello world just as a

00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:34,580
demonstration right everyone has done

00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,490
this now the problem is the point we

00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:39,230
have to execute this again what do we

00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:42,860
have to do we have to press the up arrow

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,940
3 times like this we have to press the

00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:49,090
up arrow again three times there we go

00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:52,100
once more and now we can execute it

00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:54,230
there's a bit annoying even more

00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,390
annoying is if we're at this point and

00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,940
we have to insert a line we cannot

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,430
insert a line right below the f true

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,920
right the only thing we can do at this

00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:06,680
point is press control C like this to

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,150
interrupt it fetch the lines again from

00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:10,930
the history and while fetching them

00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:14,360
insert the lines so this really annoying

00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,830
now coming back to prompt toolkit

00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,680
at the library I've been working on for

00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:21,920
the last three years and about one year

00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:24,560
and a half ago I release the tool called

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,070
PT piden so there's a Python shell built

00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,500
on top of prom tickets now let's do the

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:34,880
same thing here we print we do an F

00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:38,810
through with print hello like this we

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,690
print world and you see as i type i have

00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:46,490
seen packs highlighting right and also I

00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:49,160
very nice code completion now if we have

00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:52,220
to execute this again the only thing I

00:39:49,160 --> 00:40:01,430
have to do is press the up RL echo only

00:39:52,220 --> 00:40:04,460
ones like this there we go now even more

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:07,130
we have multi line editing that means we

00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,340
can navigate in two directions we can

00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:14,360
move the arrows up and insert lines in

00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:18,710
between here and we can just execute the

00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:21,200
whole block in one keystroke so prompt

00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:23,930
toolkit is a library that implements

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,540
those kind of things for people who want

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:29,060
to implement interactive applications at

00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:30,830
the common line from took a does most of

00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:33,830
your headline functionality so red line

00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:35,990
is the library that's used by the native

00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:38,060
potential it's used by many common line

00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:40,610
applications and most of the headline

00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,470
functionality like VI keybindings Emacs

00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:44,390
key bindings hate works incremental

00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,550
search all those kind of things that you

00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,860
expect they're implemented in prom

00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:55,280
tickets so we can search back in history

00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:58,900
and execute from this tree coming back

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,430
to do my presentation we have seen this

00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,710
so lately I got in touch with the

00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:06,740
ipython goggle developers and we

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:09,020
collaborated a lot and this resulted in

00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:11,270
ipython 5 so maybe you have seen I've

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:15,170
seen it it's released a few weeks ago

00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:17,300
and I Python 5 has a front-end built on

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:18,710
top of prom tickets so that means that

00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,900
the functionality that you have just

00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,470
seen a pity Pytel like the syntax

00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:26,450
highlighting like the multi-line editing

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,040
it's all present in the latest version

00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:30,050
of ipod and five

00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:35,510
with Windows support mac support and

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:37,610
Linux support further the only thing I

00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:39,650
haven't said it yet is that we support

00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:41,650
bracket toothpaste so that means if you

00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:45,200
are pasting a chunk of fighting coach

00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:47,660
it's recognized as being a paste and it

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,430
won't execute it yet it's inserted as

00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:51,680
one block of Python code and a

00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:54,590
multi-line buffer so you can edit it

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,190
before you execute it and also means

00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:02,420
that the tap that sort of indication

00:41:57,190 --> 00:42:06,650
will be kept like it was and further we

00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:09,500
have more support in the last year many

00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:11,600
tools were created using prompt toolkit

00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,490
so this is the list the list keeps

00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,640
growing many people start creating tools

00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:19,070
on top of from took it this is one of

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,230
the last one HTTP prompt wedges

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,320
combination of HTTP and prompt toolkit

00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:27,380
which is nice tool to do HTTP GET and

00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,020
post requests these are a few others so

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,830
there we see a few database clients like

00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:37,520
PG CLI and my CLI and AWS shell to do

00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:39,680
interaction with Amazon I've even to

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,960
full screen applications so buy them for

00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:44,630
instance which is a implementation of VI

00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,940
in fightin it smart as a proof of

00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,490
concept but if you want to play wit with

00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:53,480
it it's fully functional not all the

00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,940
functionality of real VI but it is

00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,600
usable and we have pi max which is a

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:01,430
clone of tea mugs & pure python as well

00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,920
that one is very usable I use it all the

00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:05,390
day as a replacement for Mighty Max and

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,450
every time when I made some

00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:13,910
functionality I added to Emacs of or to

00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:16,010
climax so that's it if you want to find

00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:18,860
me can find me on github on Twitter here

00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,140
conference as a reminder we have the pep

00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:24,490
installs so you can hit install I fight

00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,490
and Devin stop BTW python

00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:36,300
thank you next is Matthias have after

00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:36,300
Matthias we've got one Luis can okay no

00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,580
snarling hissing and tearing at my

00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:44,170
clothes he was a frenzy of activity as I

00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:47,140
was dressed only in a light t-shirt

00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:49,390
summer riding gloves and jeans this was

00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,010
a bit of a cause for concern the furry

00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:54,100
little tornado was doing quite some

00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:56,500
damage picture a large man on a huge

00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,510
sunset red touring bike dressed in jeans

00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,490
t shirt and leather gloves puttering

00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,680
along at maybe 25 miles an hour down a

00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:07,770
quiet residential treat and in the fight

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:11,550
of his life with a squirrel and losing

00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:11,550
much as you ready yeah

00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:23,170
hello everyone I'm gonna tell you about

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,870
a new feature of Python 3.6 which you

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,490
may have heard of maybe not it's mostly

00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,010
for those of you who haven't heard of it

00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:33,550
so a quick show of hands how many are

00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:38,620
reading the Python 3 come 3.6 release

00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:40,230
notes draft okay that's nice so maybe

00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:42,580
half of you will learn something new now

00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:47,140
it's called literal string and

00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:50,440
tribulation and it's a hep 498 so

00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:53,830
suppose you have a function simple hello

00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,560
world function you can use string

00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:59,860
interpolation to insert arguments into

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:01,780
the stuff you're going to print so it

00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:08,620
says hello world hello Harry you should

00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:11,170
probably know this and the the thing

00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,270
about string interpolation is if you

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:17,020
have an application where you're doing

00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:18,850
logging in the real world maybe some of

00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:22,360
your log lines are really long and have

00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:24,340
several things to interpolate basically

00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:27,340
we would like to be able to do the same

00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:31,240
thing as we can do in the shell and in

00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:33,850
Perl and in PHP that is insert variables

00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:38,800
inside the string literal and have them

00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:41,590
be inserted where they are so my second

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,160
example here uses the dot format which

00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:49,120
looks like what we want but again the

00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:51,430
problem is that I have to specify the

00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:54,130
variables to interpolate next to the

00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:56,530
string literal and not inside of it so

00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,840
the solution is the literal string

00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:02,890
interpolation feature of Python 3.6 and

00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:04,540
it's you basically put an F in front of

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:08,200
the string literal so it's called an F

00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:10,930
string and you can put any kind of

00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:15,400
Python expression that you want and it

00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:19,210
will just be evaluated at runtime so in

00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,520
this example the name greeting will be

00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:23,260
taken from one of the arguments and

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,920
target will be taken from the arguments

00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:28,900
and we call the type title string method

00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:34,000
to uppercase the

00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:37,390
the word so I started playing a bit

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,690
around with this a bit and I've made a

00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,670
small program that will automatically

00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:46,480
apply this transformation so you can

00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:48,310
upgrade your code to use up titan 3.6 as

00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:52,000
soon as it comes out if that's what you

00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:54,970
fancy so i took a real world example

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,720
from one of my machine learning hand ins

00:46:54,970 --> 00:47:02,080
i have a some gradient descent algorithm

00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:05,830
i've implemented and i'm writing out how

00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:07,630
long into the method are we and which

00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:11,020
iteration is it and what's the current

00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:13,660
cost and blah blah blah and basically i

00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:17,620
have a program that can automatically

00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:20,560
turn this into the f string below where

00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:24,310
you can see how we do number formatting

00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:32,070
just like the old format method of

00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:34,690
strings and it has currently i have just

00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:37,270
integrated this with them because that's

00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:41,140
my editor of choice you can blame me all

00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:43,720
you want it works like this you can

00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:46,230
select the text you want to transform in

00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:51,250
your editor and press the equal sign

00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:54,820
that does met thus this transformation

00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:57,040
and there you go it has turned the print

00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:59,290
statement into you something that uses f

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,990
strings and we can sort of tweak it from

00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:04,390
here and that's all if you're interested

00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,700
the code is on github I'm mortal on

00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:10,210
github and you can go check it out and

00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:14,320
it's a small project using the ast

00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:16,750
library that does a symbol parse of your

00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:19,840
Python input file and simply looks for

00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:23,520
the percent formatting expressions

00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,520
that's not thank you

00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:33,640
when Louise after Hawaiian Louise is

00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:38,979
Andrea Andrea crop tee do we say okay

00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,979
ghetto and after Andrea is Dave McIver I

00:48:41,499 --> 00:48:46,519
grab for him with my left hand after a

00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,619
few misses I finally managed to snag his

00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,390
tail with all of my strength I flung the

00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:52,369
evil roading off to the left of the bike

00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:54,319
almost running into the right curb as i

00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:56,029
recoiled from the fro now it should have

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:58,819
done it the matter should have ended

00:48:56,029 --> 00:49:00,170
right there it really should have the

00:48:58,819 --> 00:49:01,969
squirrel could have sailed into one of

00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:03,410
the pristine kept yards we've gone on

00:49:01,969 --> 00:49:05,029
about his business and I could have

00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:07,489
headed home no one would have been the

00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:10,640
wiser that this was no ordinary squirrel

00:49:07,489 --> 00:49:12,799
this was not even an angry ordinary

00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,729
squirrel this was an evil mutant attacks

00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:18,349
Perl of death twisted evil somehow he

00:49:16,729 --> 00:49:20,180
caught my gloved finger with one of his

00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:22,279
little paws and with the force of my

00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,959
throw swung around and was a with

00:49:22,279 --> 00:49:26,869
rounding sump and an amazing impact

00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:28,549
landed squarely on my back and resumed

00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:30,859
his rather antisocial and extremely

00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:32,630
distracting activities he also managed

00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:34,849
to take my left glove with him the

00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:37,299
situation was not improved not improved

00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:37,299
at all

00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,670
thank you very much mm-hmm this is going

00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,470
to be quick because I'm nervous as hell

00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:53,440
not because I don't stick usually in

00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:55,000
front of hundreds of people that because

00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,670
I don't easily prepare slides in five

00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,770
minutes my name is khan risk i know i'm

00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:02,350
the chair of the Pythons pain non-profit

00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:04,360
and we organize the pike on in spain but

00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:06,580
before getting into detail let's put

00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,880
some contest here okay this is the

00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:14,200
country that you are now so far this

00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:16,930
week and if we zoom to the south east of

00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:19,390
the country you can see this white thing

00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:22,150
over here which is the only construction

00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,890
of made by humans that is visible from

00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,130
space and it's actually one of the

00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:30,430
biggest greenhouse cultivation in the

00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:33,670
world it would soon even more we can see

00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:36,850
this for gravel scenery that was used a

00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:38,830
lot in the 70s and the 80s to film some

00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:40,360
spaghetti westerns and if you swim a

00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:43,510
little boat you can see Clint Eastwood

00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:45,700
or whether when he was there well we are

00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:47,140
celebrating the bike honest this year in

00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,900
amarilla which is the city in the

00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:51,670
southeast I was talking to you before is

00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:54,760
going to be our fourth edition and we're

00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:56,320
aiming out on 400 in this and what are

00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,320
you going to get it you come to this

00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:02,340
spike on as well you're going to get to

00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:05,350
see a very beautiful city with a lot of

00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:08,620
Arabic heritage lots of very beautiful

00:51:05,350 --> 00:51:11,440
monuments and also one of the most

00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:13,240
beautiful beaches in Spain and we even

00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,980
celebrated it in October instead of

00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,360
November so you can relax a bit and go

00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,790
to the beach because it's going to be

00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,200
very good weather still this is the

00:51:18,790 --> 00:51:22,530
other thing that you're going to get

00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,150
because the folder is very very good

00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:26,890
maybe not as sophisticated here in the

00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:31,290
Basque Country but i can assure you that

00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:31,290
the quantity is going to

00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:39,680
yes ah this is called the tapas thing

00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:43,010
here in the south and you also get to

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,710
know the wonderful Spanish community the

00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:47,900
Spanish community is so friendly and

00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,700
we've been celebrating these bygone days

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,790
as I told you for four years already and

00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:55,160
it's always amazing to get to know these

00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:57,380
amazing people this is a picture of the

00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,710
third edition which was so last year in

00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:03,230
Valencia again like 49 400 people also

00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:05,750
and this is the group picture at the end

00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,480
of the second edition in photography so

00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:10,100
they call for papers is still open so

00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:15,340
what cleanings what wants you to come

00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:19,340
thank you very much all right thank you

00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:21,830
Andrea you're next then David McIver and

00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:27,410
then Anselm Ling now and some of you

00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:29,330
here and so yeah okay very good how's

00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,160
our timing we got ten minutes a quick

00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:33,560
announcement if you haven't picked up

00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:35,210
your ticket yet for the social dinner

00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,850
and you want to go you have to pick it

00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:39,170
up before 615 so the lightning talks are

00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:41,030
not going to run over will finish at six

00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:42,230
you've then got 15 minutes to pick up

00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:44,120
your ticket from the registration desk

00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:47,210
after which is closed and then you can't

00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:49,640
go to the social event mmm there you go

00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,520
nothing that might be booing would be

00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,780
this guy on his motorbike his attacks

00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,000
were continuing and now I could not

00:52:53,780 --> 00:52:57,770
reach him I was startled to say the

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,110
least the combination the force of the

00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:02,510
throw only having one hand the throttle

00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:04,700
hand on the handle bars and my jerking

00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:06,680
back unfortunately put a healthy twist

00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,690
through my right hand and into the

00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,890
throttle now a healthy twist on the

00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:14,690
throttle of the victory cross county

00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:16,130
talk and have only one result talk that

00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,500
is what the victory cross county tour is

00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:21,020
made for and she is very very good at it

00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,870
the engine roared and the front wheel

00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:28,960
left the pavement the squirrel screamed

00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:28,960
in anger Andrew yep

00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,260
hi everyone I'm on the record did I work

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,270
for a company in London call a walker

00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:42,059
and one of the projects I work in the

00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:44,940
last few months is a migration of a big

00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:46,920
code base from jungle project from my

00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:49,010
sequel to focus so i just want to share

00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:51,210
with you a little bit of what we

00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:53,130
encountered and what were the problems

00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:57,390
and try to help you not to do the same

00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:59,069
mistakes so why first well I think this

00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:09,660
image is amazing so that's enough

00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:12,059
information I didn't I don't take credit

00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:16,079
for that but I think it's good so the

00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:18,180
reality is well originally the beginning

00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,130
why they chose my sequel was kind of a

00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:23,220
coincidence because they had to go live

00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:25,559
and the only thing installed on the CTO

00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:28,859
machine was my sequence so they decided

00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:31,500
to go from a sequence so after few years

00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:33,540
we we wanted ready to switch to pause

00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:37,020
yes but then we found out of an actual

00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:38,790
real problem we had of some query which

00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:41,700
we need to do all the time everywhere

00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:45,119
which involves a self join and some

00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:47,040
other ugly stuff with my sequel and has

00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:49,260
to be more or less than windrow sequel

00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:51,930
or with some crazy hack with the orem

00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:53,910
and however posters has and this nice

00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:55,740
thing called this thing on which my sig

00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:58,290
alert map which allows you to write this

00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:00,720
query in a very simple non nested thing

00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:03,599
which can also be written in there I'm

00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:07,559
in just one line so amazing that was

00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:10,920
kind of the final reason to do they find

00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:12,450
the actual switch so how you actually do

00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:18,299
that well all you have to do is to

00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:22,910
change the settings the data will be

00:55:18,299 --> 00:55:27,299
moved automatically by jungle and then

00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:30,630
that's it well normally I think that

00:55:27,299 --> 00:55:33,440
didn't work so so just a few numbers to

00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:36,930
understand how big the project was is a

00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,000
big project so one of the ninety

00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:44,130
thousand lines of pie to code more than

00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,930
100 apps 383 tables were great and at

00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,119
the moment we have around 3,000

00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:53,069
which takes very fast but there are a

00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:54,510
lot of tests so the plan we are in

00:55:53,069 --> 00:55:57,119
progress actually is not finished but

00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:58,829
almost there is to first that adapt all

00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:02,000
the code then actually do the data

00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:05,190
migration itself and then we're done

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:07,619
nate I'm aggression actually was not as

00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:10,369
easy as I thought because i found this

00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:13,559
project called PG loader which is great

00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:15,480
it's fast it's smart and everything the

00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:18,599
only problem is that you don't really

00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,700
get any live replication of the data so

00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:24,450
you kinda have to do the switch in one

00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:27,180
go which is kind of scary and that's not

00:56:24,450 --> 00:56:29,069
very nice thing but yeah that means we

00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:30,809
have to try it many times first the be

00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:33,750
sure works and only one we are sure

00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:36,569
everything is fine we have to do it 111

00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:39,180
god ichiro that weather is really nice

00:56:36,569 --> 00:56:42,000
tool and we also had great communication

00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:43,800
with the author that helped us a lot and

00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,079
also i'm also managed to convince the

00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:49,339
company to sponsor him to do some

00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:51,660
feature win either so that's also write

00:56:49,339 --> 00:56:54,150
another problem we had was that we have

00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:55,950
very big tables and just a few of them

00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:57,660
and we actually don't need to pour them

00:56:55,950 --> 00:57:00,480
at all and we will move them somewhere

00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:02,910
else completely so to do that to kind of

00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,400
handle the situation we just drop the

00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:08,430
foreign keys change queries and then do

00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:09,960
a database router to just keep all these

00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:11,760
things where they are now and we will

00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,119
handle them later that's another option

00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,670
you can use the changes in the code

00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:21,030
first of all get everything running on

00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:22,530
your CIS like Jenkins or whatever we may

00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,809
be sure that the new code doesn't break

00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:27,089
postures anymore look for all the probe

00:57:24,809 --> 00:57:28,650
Despres the places where there are row

00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:30,270
queries that you want to fix and test

00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,400
them and then you have to do a lot of

00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:34,650
manual testing maybe and check for

00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,990
things so one thing which I had to do

00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:39,030
for example since we had a lot of api's

00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:41,450
which were not tested at all I add to

00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:46,890
our oath like a I fighter notebook to

00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:48,450
run three parallel Django instances

00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:50,099
connecting code three two different

00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:52,770
servers on different configurations and

00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:55,140
then we did not book connected to all of

00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:57,780
them and then do the comparison of the

00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:59,700
results doing some approximation of the

00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:01,800
floating-point numbers we get back

00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:03,089
there was a lot of work but that's

00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,660
mostly because there were no test for

00:58:03,089 --> 00:58:08,609
this thing so yeah so this these are

00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:11,369
just the tips of the things you probably

00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:13,500
should do really use migrations for

00:58:11,369 --> 00:58:14,849
everything that's luckily we do that we

00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:17,130
don't have anything in the database

00:58:14,849 --> 00:58:20,609
schema which is not in a migration and

00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:22,920
that helps a lot test all your code and

00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:24,810
all your queries because as you will

00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,700
make life a lot easier when you have to

00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:29,339
do anything like that never rely on

00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:31,530
implicit ordering of databases that's

00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:35,400
really bad thing but because my seek

00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:37,170
will always ray orders on ID anyway

00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:40,260
everything is fine but positon do that

00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,880
and then try to make your jumbo Jungo

00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:43,560
ops independent from each other so they

00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,119
don't like import models all over the

00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:47,910
place and this all like a tangled mess

00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,200
and then split your monoliths as soon as

00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:51,930
possible because they would really help

00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,609
with anything older yeah conclusions

00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:58,910
this is a sentence I stole from this

00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:58,910
morning yeah and that's it thank you

00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,550
Thank You Andrea our final talk today

00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:07,260
will be well by Dave McIver David McIver

00:59:05,550 --> 00:59:08,580
that's the next one anybody who did sign

00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:10,650
up and didn't quite make the slot today

00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,420
please come and sign up again tomorrow

00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:13,560
if you're keen you'll get there super

00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,790
early and then we'll know that you

00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:20,040
desperately wanted to do your lightning

00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:22,260
talk that's about that now where were we

00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,810
we had a man there we had a man

00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:27,150
screaming the squirrel screamed in anger

00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:30,180
the victory cross county tour screamed

00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:33,030
in ecstasy I screamed in well I just

00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:35,100
plain screamed now picture a man on the

00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:36,960
huge sunset red touring bike dressed in

00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:39,090
jeans a slightly squirrel torn t-shirt

00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:41,280
wearing only one leather glove and

00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:43,440
roaring at maybe 50 miles an hour and

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:53,190
rapidly accelerating down a quiet

00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:56,520
residential street I'm not a squirrel

00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:58,500
sorry I'm David McKeever I just want to

00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,150
tell you quickly about the testing

00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,260
library that I write called hypothesis

01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:02,580
I'm afraid you've already missed the

01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,680
training course that was yesterday

01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:10,170
morning but hopefully I can intrigue you

01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:12,150
enough to check it out anyway the basic

01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:14,280
idea of hypothesis is that it makes your

01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:17,030
test smarter and less work to write

01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:20,160
mostly less work to write by adding a

01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:24,570
source of generated data to them so that

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:26,130
it can try probing your test code with a

01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:27,840
whole bunch of different values and find

01:00:26,130 --> 01:00:30,350
the one that you inevitably forgot

01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:33,390
because we all right our test front tire

01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:35,940
the this is what it looks like it's a

01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:38,280
simple decorator library it works with

01:00:35,940 --> 01:00:40,200
any testing framework you like it's not

01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,850
a test runner I use pie dough test it

01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,760
works with unit test it works with knows

01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:46,410
whatever and this is an example from

01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:48,960
when we were testing some mercurial code

01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:54,090
the curio represents a bunch of stuff

01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:56,190
internally as utf-8 B which is a way of

01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:58,380
for some reason taking arbitrary binary

01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:00,840
data and turning it into valid unique

01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:04,110
head and that works about as well as

01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:05,940
you'd expect I don't know how widely

01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:07,440
that you use this one is I want to claim

01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,600
that this is a great bug because

01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,220
material was

01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,900
have been in production and widely is

01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,850
for about 10 years but I suspect the

01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,310
reality is that this is a net and a

01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:18,620
relatively small corner there about this

01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:20,330
is fixed now by the way we found a bunch

01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:23,360
more bugs once they in the same code

01:01:20,330 --> 01:01:26,150
once they fix this one it's also found

01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:27,950
bugs in the Python standard library this

01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:30,800
is from the new statistics module in

01:01:27,950 --> 01:01:31,940
Python 3 one of the many nice things you

01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,960
get when you finally get around to

01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:39,380
switching 2003 and it even works now it

01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:41,570
didn't then it to be fair this is a

01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:46,640
horrible thing to do to any statistics

01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:47,960
module in this case it was calculating

01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:51,530
the mean and it doesn't work well with

01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:53,210
very large numbers and it works with

01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:56,450
most of the things we're going to want

01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:57,740
to use this is a test using numpy this

01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:59,270
one's not actually a bug it's just

01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:05,150
floating point numbers being awful again

01:01:59,270 --> 01:02:07,700
and I'm sorry if you're doing scientific

01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:09,890
Python or anything with numpy it will

01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,230
slot right into your testing I'm sure

01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:15,290
you're all testing your scientific hood

01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:17,930
it works with Django to it works really

01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:20,540
well and go it will automatically take a

01:02:17,930 --> 01:02:22,010
look at your models and just go oh you

01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:23,510
need these types I know how to generate

01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:26,450
those here let me generate a model for

01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:28,280
you from scratch in this example we're

01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,840
overriding a bunch of things but you

01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,560
don't have to do that the actor Bach

01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:35,540
generation is pretty good this one won't

01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:40,130
make sense without the full example but

01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:41,840
basically one in this case is tries to

01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:45,560
add the same user to a project twice and

01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:46,910
the code didn't expect that this is one

01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,410
I don't have time to go into properly

01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:49,670
but one of the really cool hypothesis

01:02:48,410 --> 01:02:52,190
features is that you can give it a

01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:54,500
complete model of your API and tell it

01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:58,160
what should work and it generates random

01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:59,840
programs against your API and eventually

01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:01,550
finds one the brakes this one's a bit

01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,680
experimental and slightly harder to use

01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:04,910
than the rest but it's pretty cool when

01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:07,640
it does the right thing know when it

01:03:04,910 --> 01:03:09,440
works for you that's more or less all

01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:11,720
I'm going to say I hope you check it out

01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:13,010
go to the website is hypothesis start

01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,680
works and it's got a whole bunch of

01:03:13,010 --> 01:03:17,840
introductory articles it really is quite

01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,369
straightforward to get started and we've

01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:22,759
quite a good community

01:03:19,369 --> 01:03:23,710
and who if I'm not around they will be

01:03:22,759 --> 01:03:31,460
happy to answer your questions as well

01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:33,440
thanks again thank you very much

01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:35,420
everyone that is us finished actually

01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,680
properly on time thanks to each and

01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,450
every one of you for coming to the

01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,490
lightning talks for proposing lightning

01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:42,079
talks for being speakers for paying the

01:03:40,490 --> 01:03:43,789
registration fees for being here for

01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,499
free for going out in the evening for

01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:47,150
having dinner for being lunch see you

01:03:45,499 --> 01:03:48,650
all tomorrow and let's have a lot of

01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:49,849
several days of conferencing

01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:54,319
everything's going to be brilliant her a

01:03:49,849 --> 01:03:55,880
good night oh and i'll post the link to

01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:57,829
that squirrel story which i was about

01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,749
twenty percent of the way through I

01:03:57,829 --> 01:04:02,200
think that's maybe better read on its

01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:02,200
