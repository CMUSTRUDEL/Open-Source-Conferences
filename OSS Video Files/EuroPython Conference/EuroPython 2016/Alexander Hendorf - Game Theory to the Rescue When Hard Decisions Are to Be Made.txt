Sometimes it's hard to decide when a something is really done or
cannot be improved further.
**Game theory** can help you to make complicated decisions whenever
you encounter flow problems.

-----

Game theory is "the study of mathematical models of conflict and
cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."

In our use case we had to match data  for accounting:  -  the data was
not always clean but we had some extra tools at hand and a complex
system to make good guesses. Nevertheless it was hard to decide when
to give up, some records were just not processable.
Finally we used Game theory to make the decision.

next stop would be game theory to the

00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,519
rescue when hard decision are to be made

00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:10,019
so ladies and gentlemen please welcome

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:18,570
our next speaker

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:21,350
aiexander handoff probably wait until

00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,230
the tops finish but thank you anyway

00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:28,140
okay arm I'm going to talk about Game

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:30,179
three of Weasley today so let me

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,690
introduce yourself and my cell phone so

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:37,230
my day job I develop and I consult so

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:39,360
I'm moving vertically surfing and I

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,340
review technical solutions and we work

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,379
on high bringing high tech startups

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,750
together with bigger companies if they

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,390
have something that helps both companies

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,210
so that's what I'm doing the day time if

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,840
you have a challenging high tech startup

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,730
talk to me maybe we can help you arm and

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,250
also I'm one of the organizers of the

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,609
conference here program sharing and also

00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,559
active in the MongoDB community I'd like

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,970
to talk and if you have any comments

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,580
questions feel free to ping me on

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,040
Twitter later arm in friary arm we will

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,979
only be able to stretch the surface of

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,500
game theory arm today so there won't be

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:24,090
no coding if you last chance to leave

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,340
now and I hope I can give you an idea

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,979
but gave here you because it's it's a

00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:34,619
little bit live beyond if else else if

00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:38,130
it's it's it's a glance into a different

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:40,920
life a little bit um I stumbled across

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,750
using it just like by coincidence at the

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,549
beginning of the year well actually the

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,130
arm call for proposals we're running and

00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:51,020
yeah people seem to like the idea

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:57,600
unfortunately

00:01:51,020 --> 00:02:00,840
so I mean game theory is very human

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,090
concept it's not tech it hasn't

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,750
background or in economics and

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,550
philosophy and and I think you can

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,890
imagine yourself like our world is

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,150
getting much more hectic complicated so

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,390
many options this

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,159
Asians or and we require to to make

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,129
decisions all the time and sometimes

00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:24,060
this can be really difficult armed or

00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:26,040
stressful um and and we very often worry

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,000
did we do the right make the right

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:35,420
choice um did I pick the right Pokemon

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,420
to win the next challenge yeah

00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,040
so little knowledge of game theory can

00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:44,670
become really handy are not only coding

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,319
life solving are some problems and it's

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:49,950
about making the best decisions you can

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,530
but probably not only best decisions for

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,379
yourself also of the best decisions for

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,849
you and the people who surround you um

00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,859
will step into to that later so just

00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:06,030
think about how do you make decisions

00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:08,280
how to make judgments now do you really

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,329
know down there like the pros and cons

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,359
and wake them up

00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:18,900
some people do um some people don't they

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:23,040
very much rely on their stomach as we

00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:27,329
say in Germany um so um think about do

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:32,250
your decisions affect others and do you

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:34,199
care about it arm and and and and I

00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:36,780
suppose we're game theory is is going

00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:40,169
arm you have to anticipate the decisions

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,750
that others do while you're interacting

00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:46,400
with them and how they impact you and

00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,780
how your decisions impact the others and

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,079
yeah this is basically like the basic

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,829
idea of a game free and actually I

00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:58,260
stumbled across it um for one client we

00:03:55,829 --> 00:04:03,419
were or we're getting messy accounting

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:08,729
data in from some very popular online

00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:10,919
platform for videos and we can check

00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:13,919
what what's in their lap bike sometimes

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:16,019
they just match by some word stuff we

00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,570
don't really know and we try to account

00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:23,490
to the people who gave the video

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:25,770
material or audio licenses and um so if

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:29,160
we could do it manually but

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:31,949
like really a lot a lot of later um we

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,289
would be like many people and not

00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:37,800
effective because we are it's really a

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:39,660
penny accounting business and so we also

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,090
use like systems like for example like

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:45,479
elastic search and really elastic search

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:46,860
who knows elastic search yeah most of

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,229
you so you know you can also get a

00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,810
probability back on the quality or the

00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:55,110
results you get so how you get some

00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:57,000
indicator how elastic search things how

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,720
accurate your results and so yeah we

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,610
have something to work with so but we

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,590
have a like also like customized systems

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,810
we can look directly the database we

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,340
have some done some funny search stuff I

00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,250
don't want to go too deep in this but

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,930
just like I was really stuck like in a

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,990
combination of oh okay at all these

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,539
expert systems I can ask and probably

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,669
one expert system will improve my input

00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:23,069
and if I put it into me me the other

00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:26,280
expert system I can even get better

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:30,180
input and so I was getting really

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,039
confused like and so I thought what

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,880
about I'm game theory because I can't

00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,669
really use is ELLs elses then were will

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,340
to really solve it and so um I

00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,669
remembered game theory and gave it a try

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,820
on so let me introduce you or go into

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,949
game theory and hope it will help you to

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,500
make decisions and your coding or

00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:54,810
whatever problems you're facing or like

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,620
basically maybe just in your life who

00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,469
may be even better than your life so in

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,130
free very often it you see a picture

00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:07,469
about game theory you will see chess and

00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,479
yes but it's actually a very bad example

00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:14,039
because it's game for you about playing

00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:17,969
games no again you can leave if you

00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,590
thought it's a game talk it's not about

00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:22,680
playing games it's about interactions

00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:26,009
between humans which we can also like

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,469
prevent it we can basically arm

00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:31,229
imagining it's also like a game like

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:33,120
simplified version of interactions we

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:36,800
can regard this as a game and we know

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,110
games like chess or go or tic-tac-toe

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,560
but

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:46,130
deterministic on every player knows at

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:54,380
every stage of the game everything you

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:56,840
see you can see boy so everything

00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,270
basically it would be like playing poker

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:06,170
with all cards on the table all the time

00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:08,150
um and basically it's just like um it

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:10,940
you can calculate all possible results

00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:12,680
now of course we don't because our

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,320
brains are not capable and even

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,340
computers are not capable of calculating

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:26,770
all the results imaginable for all for

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:29,900
each and every move in in time so it's

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,690
imagining like game theory having all

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,210
the cards on the table um if the

00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:37,400
informant the information is not not

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,440
sorry it's not having all the cards on

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,850
the table some information might be

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,980
hidden arm and is there a way arm to

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:50,540
determine on how you still can evaluate

00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,240
chances come make built up basically

00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:57,500
build up a strategy and basically this

00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:00,140
is what I was doing um then as a as a

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,660
eight year old I believed I will win

00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,670
chess against the partner of my mother

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,920
if I just chose the right color in the

00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,020
beginning um after I lost many many

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,800
games I came to the conclusion that's

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,420
not the case it's very unlikely but I

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,570
think like the average chess player uh

00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,870
is also trying to find a strategy arm

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:23,330
and anticipating what the next moves of

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:25,280
your opponent might be although you can

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,280
basically calculate each and every

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,870
possible result you're anticipating what

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:33,410
your player will do you're anticipating

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:35,690
his strategy and this is getting us a

00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:38,510
little bit closer to game theory and

00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:43,250
game theory was not just like invented

00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:46,610
um overnight um let's have a little

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:49,360
glance into game here history now it was

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:52,910
like first mention this goes back to the

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,410
1700s um Wargrave letters

00:08:52,910 --> 00:09:03,920
guys from Britain armed there's a French

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:06,920
guy who are wrote a paper on leading in

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,830
the direction arm and then in the

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,700
beginning of the 27th century things

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:18,380
start to pick up with the bounced zem oh

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:20,210
no sorry and Samuel you buddy unbending

00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,440
the Mangler the woody teal real sharp

00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:27,980
ears which actually can translate about

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:32,090
how applying arm sets your feet set

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:35,990
theory in chess games arm then then in

00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:37,850
the nineteen late 1920s arm the thing

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:41,180
starts to really pick up with a paper

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,550
from a Hungarian our our scientists

00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:48,380
Jonathan Lyman I think he moved to the

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,180
US later and he wrote another paper to a

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,420
tear weed excess of Schuyler which is

00:09:50,180 --> 00:10:00,020
about like theory in board games and

00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:02,530
this paper got noticed a lot and in 1944

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,410
he published a book co-authored with

00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:09,380
Oscar Morgenstern aa theory of games and

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,560
economic behavior and so we see already

00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:16,430
on the game view thing is very close to

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,070
economics and usually we think economic

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,050
and people caring about economics a lot

00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:24,470
it's just a soft business it's not like

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,780
programming is much much better so um we

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,320
don't probably look into theories there

00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:32,390
and the challenges is can be built up a

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,720
mathematical model can we basically

00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:39,170
analyze or calculate results of of

00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,500
people's actions on the decisions the

00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,570
players might do and basically that's

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,060
probably the most famous thing in the

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,820
1950s it's like the prisoner's dilemma

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:53,960
and John Nash came up with the national

00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:56,270
equilibrium made that work and yeah it's

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,730
very famous because like John Nash life

00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:01,370
was the Beautiful Mind movie so he's

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:04,310
very popular and by the way this is a

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:09,230
picture of John von Neumann there

00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:11,300
Hungarian scientists so background a

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,810
game theory is in economics political

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,580
science and psychology as used as well

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:20,440
in logic computer science by largely

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,440
with biology and poker

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:26,210
it's an mathematical approach to real

00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:28,490
life simulations play situations that

00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:32,650
involve two or more concession makers

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:36,110
and each decision maker view for example

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:39,860
has a number of different actions they

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,350
might take um and the ultimate outcome

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,920
does not just be can depend on your

00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,980
actions

00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,760
it also depends on what the other people

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,960
do arm so you are forced to think and

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,450
come up with a strategy um and this is

00:11:52,960 --> 00:12:01,550
basically so let's start with a really

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,330
simple game this looks something easy

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:05,180
and practical

00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:07,040
it's called zero-sum game and the

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:12,290
zero-sum game is the winner takes it all

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,360
and the others game is the others lost

00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,190
and I'm really happy so many people and

00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,020
it's so crowded because I would like to

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,540
play two fing amaura

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,350
so please partner with the one on your

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:23,350
right

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,410
yeah sorry sorry sorry I thought you can

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:37,990
go from lunch have a nap I'm sorry Mel

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:43,390
back to action so to finger Mora is a

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:46,750
very simple game pick a partner and you

00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,660
basically are you troll you have two

00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:53,830
choices show one finger or two finger

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,380
and you have to decide who is the even

00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:01,420
player and who's the up player and then

00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,920
just like as rock and scissors you play

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:05,080
with your partner if you show your

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:08,170
fingers at the same time and if the

00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:10,090
result is even even player wins and you

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:14,110
result as odd or player wins so you

00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:15,970
basically have 50/50 chance so and get

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:18,270
five minutes I will be back once you

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:18,270
have the results

00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:32,160
okay yes

00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,160
yeah oh you did a simulation okay

00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,480
Oh

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:53,100
all right guys five minutes was a joke

00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:53,100
oh yeah ready enjoy Angus

00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:12,790
okay we continue now it's good to hear

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:17,279
y'all have fun with I didn't imagine

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,279
this simple game would make you so lucky

00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:23,500
okay but basically what would be like

00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:26,980
their mathematical representation of

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:28,930
what we were just like doing um yeah we

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:50,470
call this like the strategic form and

00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:53,560
basically so yeah that's like what we

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,540
call a strategic form and so and this is

00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,470
also like the basis you one can

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:03,100
calculate on what like these matrices um

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:06,120
so um zero sum games one winner one

00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:09,370
loser it's a very competitive this is a

00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:12,339
another nice way um it's called non zero

00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:16,269
sum games um it's more about symmetry

00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:18,490
and everyone games on for example like

00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:21,130
doing the same game in a little bit

00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,959
different form so let's do a non zero

00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:27,939
same game but please don't get as

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,649
excited as if only 15 minutes left and I

00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:35,050
have to get you to prisoner's dilemma as

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:37,509
my goal so let's play a positive way of

00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:42,880
this thing um let's do the same game but

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:46,540
um a similar game so if you show the

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,699
same count of fingers each of you gets

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:50,910
two points and if it differs you only

00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:56,290
get one point and this is basically

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:57,519
about moral about cooperation you want

00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,700
to give it a try no I think everybody

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,240
can imagine

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:04,950
so arm every idea so you can like

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,170
interactions and this is like very

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:10,680
simple interactions put into a matrix

00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:12,480
and we can work with that there's is

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,870
there are games with perfect information

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,090
as I mentioned chess go check Tac Toe so

00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,620
everybody knows about everything and all

00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:21,510
the options and outcomes for the other

00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:27,510
players and there are games with

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:32,640
incomplete information basically like so

00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:36,210
arm that's like the two and as next the

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:39,300
selecting classic game theory arming is

00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:42,050
the prisoner's dilemma so what is the

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,870
person's dilemma the prisoner's dilemma

00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:47,310
imagine they're like two criminals um

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:51,690
they're already with the police the

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:54,990
police has caught them and imagine

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:57,860
having them in two rooms in the police

00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:01,220
the strength of our Police Headquarters

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:07,260
and they're being interrogated Oh

00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:10,199
interrogator and the dilemma is um each

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:14,550
of the two criminals does not know how

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:17,339
the other criminal will decide so if you

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:22,430
know if you cooperate I mean you if you

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:25,500
ever have seen one of the UM us or

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:28,199
series they say if you cooperate or we

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,110
can make a deal with the DA and yeah you

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,120
can go you will get free yeah so the

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:36,420
thing is that you know if you cooperate

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:42,660
um you might get free you don't get any

00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:46,250
sentence but what if your colleague your

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:50,550
criminal colleague you cooperator Oh

00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:53,100
conspirator also it's cooperating um

00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:55,110
because then both are cooperating and

00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,330
it's not that L all the criminals

00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,430
cooperating they're just like us and yes

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,340
we did it we're so sorry and everybody

00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:05,370
will get free of course they will might

00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,120
they would both get a sentence a reduced

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:08,880
sentence

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,320
yeah on them and the other outcome of

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,720
course is just stay quiet

00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:17,140
and probably the police won't be able to

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,020
prove anything or probably open like

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,120
only like a minor crime um and then you

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,510
might only end up with like a one year

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:39,910
sentence and this is the prisoner's

00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:58,810
dilemma we have and now let's get it

00:18:39,910 --> 00:19:01,240
into our strategic form so you're really

00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:03,280
rude and you're really screwed you go to

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,710
jail for twenty years and you don't want

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:10,480
that and if you both keep quiet we

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:12,520
assume yeah okay do we'll get some

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,100
sentence but not to the full crime you

00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:18,910
probably might only end up in prison for

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,610
one year and how can you actually decide

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,740
because this - there's a dominant

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,050
strategy what we call in game theory

00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,470
it's a dominance of what what's always

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:33,790
the best outcome you should choose and

00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:36,550
actually confessing is because you

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,920
either get go to jail for one year or

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:44,920
five years but never for twenty years so

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:47,770
this is the best choice and and also

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,950
confessing is only the only strong Nash

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:54,850
equilibrium arm in the game and in the

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:58,270
equilibrium is basically arm when there

00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:03,490
are no more gains from no one in being

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:05,470
in the games so basically nobody wants

00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:09,280
to take any action because he can no

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,780
longer gain from it um and this is of

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,120
course in this simple game is just like

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,000
one one round but just like imagine

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:19,000
there's more criminals involved like a

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,720
gang of five and you have to think about

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,820
over to the other four people decide on

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,610
and it is it completely different game

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:29,860
because probably there are a couple

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:32,409
they're very close and they won't never

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,509
will give each other up but if it's just

00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:37,029
like some random guys you met on the

00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:41,380
street arm and you form the gang to

00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:43,240
break in you might tend to decide uh

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,549
that's better confess because I don't

00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,710
trust those guys and also I don't want

00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,500
to be a part it can be apart from them

00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,350
but you don't want to be apart from your

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,080
girlfriend or boyfriend for a time so

00:20:53,350 --> 00:21:00,009
this is where things can get complicated

00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:02,980
um and how can we calculate stuff like

00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:06,340
that arm we can use algebra as many

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:08,039
approaches Bayesian Nash equilibriums

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:12,879
we can do just like Monte Carlo

00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:16,029
simulations to arm to get some results

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:19,570
on them yeah um and there's some

00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:22,720
material you can look into um there's a

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:25,210
Python tool called gambit uh you can

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,490
just play around with and think that

00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,429
there's a really nice blog post former

00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,799
biologist Martin Jones it's evolving

00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:35,320
strategies for an iterated prisoner's

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,750
dilemma tournament and I think it's very

00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,210
descriptive with outcomes and everything

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:43,120
so I had really a lot of fun reading it

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,750
while doing research for this talk um

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,080
and there's also from Stanford on

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:52,210
Coursera a game free arm course from

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,919
Matthew Jackson which i think is really

00:21:52,210 --> 00:22:00,309
good um very well taught stuff and yeah

00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:04,240
I I hope I was able to give you a glance

00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:07,269
into game theory a little bit different

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,220
approach on thinking um and yeah I hope

00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:11,710
you had a good time and if there's time

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:18,330
left we can play some more two-finger

00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:18,330
more yeah yeah yeah thank

00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:35,520
it's chance yes hi

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:35,940
so first thank you very much for the

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,190
talk

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:43,320
can I ask you that you go back to the

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:47,880
slide where you have the matrix all

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,160
right yeah so um here it's very clear I

00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,440
pick up a little bit I hardly and can

00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,440
can hear you okay yeah

00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,830
so here I think it's very clear that the

00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,580
optimum for both if the goal is that

00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:05,130
they both serve minimum sentence is that

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,650
they both keep quiet but you said that

00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:11,370
the Nash equilibrium is basically that

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,990
if they both would confess they

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,150
basically let the doctor that's that the

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,370
best strategy is to confess because

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,310
there's no better strategy not

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:23,430
confessing but the thing is you can

00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:25,590
calculate like I mean I don't understand

00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:29,160
sorry to interrupt you or why you would

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:33,150
prefer um being in prison for five years

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:36,240
instead of one sorry I I don't I don't

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:38,880
understand why you would prefer being in

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,100
prison for five years instead of one I

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,660
mean I know they have good food but the

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,210
thing is you don't know what the other

00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,860
one does that's the problem you don't

00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:48,660
know what your partner decides on that's

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,160
the whole trick of game that's a thank

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,200
you for the question that's the key you

00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,200
don't know what the other party does

00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,350
yeah um and so you make you need to make

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:02,540
a decision on basically uh what's the

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:05,430
best move but you don't know yeah um

00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,140
that's why that's why this is that's why

00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:09,200
this is the dominant strategy it

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,240
minimizes your loss you will never go to

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,640
prison for 20 years if you confess

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:17,930
so like this place like the minimum is

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,930
doctor maximum you can

00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:24,960
so basically if you would keep quiet you

00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,360
would basically risk a very higher

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,970
penalty yeah basically if you go boy

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,510
it's a higher net I mean you're if you

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:35,370
know it's again so first of all side

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:38,610
note I think it's interesting how people

00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:40,680
standing up and being very loud it kind

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,040
of is the tragedy of the comments so

00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,230
another goofy concept but my question

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,120
really is were you able to solve your

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,690
data problems using game theory

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:53,220
I was yeah I was able to improve it um

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,800
because like the thing is when when when

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,980
do I end like like putting like the

00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:01,680
information into the next system to

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,480
improve it so basically um I didn't

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,910
mention it in the talk because it was a

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:09,180
little deeper you can also define a

00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,250
threshold and if you know like the gain

00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:14,190
will be minimum and last thing ever I

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:16,410
remember it was like 5% or so so if we

00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:20,940
say we're we think the information is

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:23,490
95% accurate and after like of also like

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,620
a threshold of iterations so it won't go

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,440
on forever I mean if you just have one

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,680
letter we might never we will never get

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,850
a real result um

00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,370
that's that that's the two things yeah

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,610
you can do threshold easily you say like

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,770
okay on percentage on probability or

00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:43,140
like iterations and then just like take

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:45,870
the result as is it was very good for

00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:49,140
improving and interaction on multiple

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:51,000
systems we have a few more questions we

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,440
don't have much time so try to be short

00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
but okay this is done we have one

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,870
question here have you used the Python

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,810
Axelrod's

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:05,760
no I know I have used it but I've seen

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:07,470
it online during URI flirt have you used

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,620
it it was developed by a friend of mine

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,720
at college yes and it's been very

00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,780
interesting in kind of raising interest

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,600
in Python programmers in the in the

00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,430
telomere but I just wondered if you had

00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,470
a strategy in the tournament

00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:24,690
no actually like actually I was quite

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:29,070
surprised because I thought when I when

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:30,470
I did research on when I was trying to

00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:33,230
solve the problem on

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,600
I was doing I just thought okay - game

00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:37,159
free urea I expected like at least ten

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,490
libraries and the result they were

00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:42,080
hardly any so whispered surprise because

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,640
usually there's a patent library for

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,830
everything in life

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:51,530
so yes um it'd be great if we could pick

00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:54,409
up on the like helping and building

00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:57,289
stuff like that and also like um just

00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:59,179
like at game theory - all tool set of

00:26:57,289 --> 00:27:01,309
thinking when we trying to solve

00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:03,830
problems because and often like at least

00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:07,000
I feel of being like programming a lot

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:09,860
um you tend to think very deterministic

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,419
this is the truth this is the end game

00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,820
here opens up your mind to be a little

00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:18,799
bit more flexible finding a practical

00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:21,559
solution that's yeah very well we are

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,309
out of time so let's thank you

00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,309
