Sometimes it's hard to decide when a something is really done or
cannot be improved further.
**Game theory** can help you to make complicated decisions whenever
you encounter flow problems.

-----

Game theory is "the study of mathematical models of conflict and
cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers."

In our use case we had to match data  for accounting:  -  the data was
not always clean but we had some extra tools at hand and a complex
system to make good guesses. Nevertheless it was hard to decide when
to give up, some records were just not processable.
Finally we used Game theory to make the decision.
