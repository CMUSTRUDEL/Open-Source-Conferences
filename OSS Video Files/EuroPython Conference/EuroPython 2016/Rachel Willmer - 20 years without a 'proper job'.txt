Have you ever wondered how you could be your own boss? or how you
could make money from your side project? or build the next Facebook or
Uber.

To be a coder in today's world of work is to have amazing
opportunities to design the business life you want.

I've enjoyed the last 20 years without a 'real job', as company
founder, freelancer and side-project-hacker.

Now I am bootstrapping my current company to profitability. Listen to
my stories and learn from my mistakes and successes.

-----

Have you ever wondered how you could be your own boss? If so, then
this talk is for you.

Maybe you're working on a sideproject and wonder how you could make
some money from it? Or maybe you have the idea for the next Facebook
or Uber?

To be a coder in today's world of work is to have amazing
opportunities to design the business life you want. You can work
remotely; you can write books, or teach, or consult, with anyone
anywhere.

You can have a crazy idea on Friday and have it running by Monday.
Design your architecture to use cloud computing, so your tiny team can
scale up your huge ideas.

Or keep it small, and just earn some extra money with a Wordpress
plugin, or a training course.

It has been 21 years since I last had a 'real job' and a regular income.

I survived creating and running a company through the madness of the
dotcom years.  I made money from sideprojects, that I had started just
for fun and for learning.  I have freelanced without needing to use an
agency to find the work.

And now I'm bootstrapping my current business to profitability. Listen
to my stories and learn from my mistakes and successes.

	00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,520

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,519
really happy to introduce our first

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,650
keynote speaker Rachel vollmer who she

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,530
will tell you about she survived 20

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:32,969
years without having a real job and yeah

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:36,149
so please give a big hand for Rachel can

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:42,149
you hear me at the back now great buenas

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:52,199
diaz me gusto mucho esta Abu bow that is

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:54,449
the end of my Spanish ok so as my talk

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:58,530
title implies i'm going to tell you how

00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,800
i have survived 20 years without having

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,359
had a proper job by which i mean i've

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,250
obviously have been working but i

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,610
haven't had a salary that somebody else

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,430
hasn't supplied to me for 21 years now

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,590
so what I'm hoping to do with this talk

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,869
is 2t to tell you some of the lessons

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,939
that I've learned over this last couple

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,670
of decades and to potentially give you

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:25,770
some ideas about things you might want

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:30,659
to think about yourself so this talk is

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:34,250
really aimed at people who are in a job

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,250
but would rather not be

00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:42,700
because I have the closure that almost

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,859
every day I get up and go to work I look

00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,590
forward to it and I look forward to it

00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:50,229
because I've built the work life that I

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:53,530
want doing the kind of work what I want

00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:55,990
and sometimes that's made me a fair bit

00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,909
of money and sometimes it hasn't but

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,130
nothing compares to the pleasure of

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:03,250
actually looking forward to going to

00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:06,640
work so this is for you if you're in a

00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:09,910
job and you'd rather not be at all or if

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,260
you would just like to perhaps make some

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,500
money out of the side project that

00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,480
you've been working on I have some

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:22,420
thoughts to share with both of those

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,700
types of people but who am I now it may

00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:29,440
be hard to imagine but that person on

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,810
the photograph is me 20 years ago and if

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
you think oh god Rachel what happened to

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:39,220
you I have to tell you I didn't look

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,069
like that then either it's amazing what

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,459
a professional photographer can do but

00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:48,130
that was to an extend that summed up

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,630
where I'd got to with my my dot-com

00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:55,060
company but I'm going to start at the

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:58,930
beginning I graduated 30 odd years ago

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,970
as an engineering student it was the end

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,849
of a recession which made it hard for

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,319
most people to to get jobs but I was

00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:08,079
lucky because I was an engineering

00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,750
student and I had learned to code it was

00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:12,340
very easy to get get a job because there

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,280
weren't many programmers around at the

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,099
time so I started off working for an

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,510
engineering company writing software

00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,840
lasted there a couple of years and i

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,510
went to a research institute which is

00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,769
where i first discovered the internet so

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,590
i've actually been on the internet for

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:32,680
30 years which is I think longer than

00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:34,590
some of you have been alive but I can

00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,060
run with the days before the internet

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,590
and so I lasted a couple years doing

00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,510
that I learned a lot of interesting

00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,519
technology related stuff but then I

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,799
thought well no this is working for the

00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:47,130
people you know is not doing it for me

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,150
so i made my first foray

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:54,570
into self-employment I left that company

00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:56,760
to be a freelance contractor again back

00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:58,770
then it was very easy to be a contractor

00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,410
because my basic pitch to anybody that

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:03,420
was thinking of hiring me was no I don't

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,030
know how to do it give me a week let's

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,050
see how far i get and that worked every

00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:12,900
time but I was not content with just

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:15,030
being a contractor even though it was a

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,450
very easy way to make a fair bit of

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,190
money at the time I had still got the

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,860
idea that at some point I wanted to do

00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:27,390
something bigger than that so I started

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,400
working on the skills and the tools i'd

00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,720
need to make a success out of that it

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,130
occurred to me that if i was going to

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,110
start a company and start lighting

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,870
business plans then i would need to know

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,170
about money not just spending it but

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,470
what it meant in a business plan context

00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:45,300
so i did an accounting diploma part time

00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,160
in the evening and at the end of that

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,830
year i've got a certificate but more

00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,170
importantly i could write a business

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,150
plan and i could understand the figures

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,010
in other people's cotton and loss

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:57,870
account balance sheets that kind of

00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:01,980
thing which turned out to be really

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,600
interesting useful later on but i didn't

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,450
start that company just then I kept

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,340
contracting and then my plan fell

00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:10,080
slightly of I because one of the

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,730
companies i went to work for as a

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,310
contract was a company called spider

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,650
systems and they were wonderful it was a

00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,270
terrific company but after a while they

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,940
said you know Rachel we like you we

00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,480
don't like you're contracting rates come

00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:27,510
and work for us so I did five years I

00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,410
spent there was a programmer manager

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:33,270
engineering manager sales support person

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,130
and that was that was all terrific fun

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,100
but we were working internet related

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:40,650
stuff in the early nineties and it was

00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,160
just a ball because everything was was

00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,600
taking off and then in the mid-90s the

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,190
internet became more of a public

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,690
property and it went now about that time

00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,910
spider this brilliant company I was

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,160
working four got taken over by an

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,479
American company so I thought this is

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,770
the time to leave this is the time i'm

00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,190
going to set up my own do my own thing

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:06,039
so I left and I had an interest at the

00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,490
time in digital cash so I started a

00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,500
digital cash company in the mid 90s

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,740
which in some respect was a great idea

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,740
because it was people thought it was

00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,810
very interesting as a concept but as a

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,690
business idea I have to tell you it was

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:25,090
a dreadful idea it was 20 years ahead of

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:28,150
its time if I'd had that idea two years

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,889
ago I'd be a gazillionaire by now but 20

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,949
years ago there just wasn't the market

00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,289
for but anyway I started this company

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:37,120
and the company was called into trader

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:38,860
if you look them up on the website now

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,289
the domain is used by spread betting

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,990
company but that's not my company mine

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:46,680
my idea was to have a digital cash

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,909
exchange server so no matter what

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,979
digital cash you were paying with

00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,080
whether it was e gold or digi gold or

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:54,370
cyber cash or mondex or any of the other

00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,710
things that were floating around there

00:06:54,370 --> 00:07:00,009
but my cash box would take your money

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:03,759
and exchanged into something more solid

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:06,219
like pounds or dollars so because that

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,870
was a concept that seemed to attract him

00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:10,930
attention I raised money I got a board

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:14,110
of directors I had a team of great staff

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:16,599
to work with me on that and I got a lot

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,370
of press partly because my concept was a

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,560
was an interesting one that was in

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:25,000
Scotland at the time we had a really

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:28,029
good comm scene going on but we didn't

00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,060
have very many women doing it so just by

00:07:28,029 --> 00:07:32,289
that chance I stood out a forbid which

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,969
is why I ended up on the cover of this

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,139
magazine it wasn't because they

00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,969
particularly wanted to write a huge

00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,639
article about me the if you looked

00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:42,039
inside the magazine it's one column but

00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:44,349
they wanted to stand out on the honour

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,599
on the shell so what easy way to do that

00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:47,830
put a woman or cover so I'm very

00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,219
grateful for that because I got this

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:53,500
lovely photo to show for it and but that

00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:56,860
kind of thing was fun but it was

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,870
distracting from the main job of

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,050
actually finding customers that wanted

00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,150
what I did and making money from it so

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,270
for those of you who remember the doc

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:09,789
boom boom times you'll remember it was

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,560
wild people were raising money for

00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:15,230
really crazy ideas

00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,460
and then suddenly around the 2000 year

00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:23,170
mark the crash happened and suddenly the

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:25,610
dot-com boom became a dot-com bust and I

00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:28,610
still had stuff I still have an office

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,990
we managed to keep that idea running for

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,540
another three years after the crash

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:34,100
which I was pretty proud of but in the

00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,780
end i just had to admit defeat it was

00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,630
not going to be possible to turn my

00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:42,170
brilliant idea and my fantastic customer

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:46,640
base into a viable business so sadly i

00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:49,300
closed it down which was one of the

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,620
hardest things I've ever had to do but

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,390
it meant I was free to go off and do

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,170
other things so this is tech takes us to

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:59,510
about 2003 now what I did after that was

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,530
I licked my wounds about six months when

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,400
you put your heart and soul into

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:06,140
building a business it's difficult to

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,690
just walk away from it it's like a

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,490
divorce or death so it took about six

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:14,180
months before I felt capable of doing

00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,170
pretty much anything else after that but

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,780
then I went back to doing a bit of

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:19,700
freelancing I went back to doing working

00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:21,230
some fascinating projects one of them

00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,850
was no pun source project which I got

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:24,290
paid for and I can talk about that a

00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,840
little later if you interested in that

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:31,910
business model but eventually I knew it

00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,310
was going to come back to this idea but

00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,010
I actually wanted to build something

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:41,930
again and this time it happened more by

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:45,530
chance because I was trying various side

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,630
projects as a way of Reese kidding

00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:50,330
myself because the problem i had at the

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,720
time was I'd worked on two big projects

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:56,570
one of them was covered by NDA's so I

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,820
couldn't talk about it to anybody which

00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:01,160
has made it hard to use on a CV the

00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:04,010
second one I was working on this open

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,370
source project which was open PGP sdk

00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:09,140
for phenomena which is cryptography so i

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,530
could talk about it all i wanted to but

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:14,830
nobody would understand so i needed to

00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:18,740
put something on my CV that I could show

00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:20,180
what it was I did and in fact what ended

00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,310
up happening as the side projects became

00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,160
the cv I haven't actually witness TV

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,589
since nineteen

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,680
t6 and I'm hoping I never will have to

00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:31,319
again so I vote side project i vote

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,449
little i did a website called how safe

00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:34,980
is your money coat UK which made it

00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:37,350
easier to understand one of the

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,269
government websites to find out whether

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,329
your money was safe in the banks when

00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:44,040
they went bust i wrote a website there

00:10:42,329 --> 00:10:46,560
was a vice checker for the wii fit when

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,990
it came out I vote I just lots of the

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,930
small things like that but one of my big

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,240
loves is ebooks and so I wrote a little

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:56,879
ebook price checker and I made it into a

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,100
website and it was the worst name I have

00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,800
ever heard in my life it was called

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,629
ebook price dot info which it did what

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,610
it said on the tin but oh my god that's

00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:06,870
an awful name and it didn't look very

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,850
good either it was really ugly i'm not

00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,529
good at design i'm good at computer

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:13,319
system design I'm just not good a

00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:16,529
graphic design but people started using

00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:18,779
it and I thought that's interesting and

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,689
then one day when I was doing I was

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:23,730
working on a contract for somebody

00:11:20,689 --> 00:11:25,680
somebody else I gotta got an approach

00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:29,040
from one of the five biggest publishers

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,240
in the world saying we want to buy your

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,920
software my immediate reaction was oh

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,439
that's interesting and then my second

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,180
reaction was hell no nobody's looking at

00:11:37,439 --> 00:11:40,889
that code it's not in a saleable

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,889
condition it's just stuff I've hacked

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,069
together but being an entrepreneur I

00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:49,380
didn't say hell no I said hmm that's

00:11:47,069 --> 00:11:51,029
very interesting I can't study the

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:53,069
software but what I'll do is licensed

00:11:51,029 --> 00:11:56,009
you the data that you need which turned

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:58,529
out to be a great answer because for the

00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:01,949
next 18 months I think it was I supplied

00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:04,649
this publisher data that they needed to

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:07,019
use for their own strategic purposes

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,269
about what price movements were doing in

00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:12,000
the e-book market and they were payment

00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,829
me handsomely for it so I was working

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,470
full-time on a contract for the BBC I

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:18,899
was working full time on this it was it

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,209
was a very financially rewarding time in

00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:23,879
my my life and to a large extent the

00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:26,339
money that I took in from that period is

00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,839
what I'm still using to fund and invest

00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:32,309
in myself for what I'm trying to do with

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,660
that site now so this is that the site

00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:35,510
as it stands now and this is what I'm

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,720
trying to make a full-time

00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:40,820
viable business you've got sites called

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,850
loves me calm it's an ebook price

00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:45,980
comparison site I encourage you to check

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,270
it out if you do it you'll see it

00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,530
doesn't actually look like this at the

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,740
moment this is the new version that's

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:53,960
coming up but what I'm trying to do with

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:56,210
this is different to what i did with

00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,900
inter trader because inter trader was

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,670
the old-style venture-backed model of

00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,620
growing a business where I had to write

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,500
a business plan I had to convince other

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:10,130
people of the merits of that plan I then

00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,950
had to get the office but i find the

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:15,890
staff get a board of directors all those

00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:18,350
all those joyous things with this I'm

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,080
trying to do with a different way what I

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,840
want to do is not go down that road of

00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:26,270
funding it through other people's money

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:29,390
until I am convinced i've got a scalable

00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,190
model because if I do that it means I'll

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:33,170
get a much better price on the valuation

00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,240
when I raise the money the next time but

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:38,660
also it means I'm giving myself the

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,270
luxury of trying things out I'm allowing

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,320
myself to try and fail with the various

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:47,090
ideas i'm using in this in this project

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:52,550
before i have other people to tell me I

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:55,670
can't do that but that's enough about me

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:58,930
I want to now talk about you and what

00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:02,060
you could do because I think we as

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:05,620
technologists are extraordinarily lucky

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:08,390
to be here at this time because of the

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:10,280
internet because of the globalization

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,460
that's going along we have the

00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:17,390
opportunity to build stuff in our back

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:20,180
bedroom by ourselves and turn it into

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:24,290
profitable businesses which can replace

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:26,300
a full-time job or just enhance the life

00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:30,470
that you have by doing it part time

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:32,780
because we don't need to hire staff

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,760
because we can build it ourselves we

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:38,670
don't have to have an office because you

00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:43,260
can use a virtual server on amazon oil

00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,850
on google or wherever i think this is a

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,770
terrific opportunity and it's one of the

00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:50,280
things i would like for people to to

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:52,980
start contemplating what they will do

00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:56,670
because to my mind we were to a change

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,410
in the way we do work the future of work

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,690
is not going to be what it was in the

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,580
past we don't have the likelihood of

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:05,220
having a full-time job even if we wanted

00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:06,750
one for the rest of our lives the nature

00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,710
of it all is becoming much more a

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,360
portfolio career where you do one job

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:15,480
followed by another contracts that you

00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:20,670
take on maybe for a day or week not for

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,140
years or decades so assuming that you

00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:27,150
have some technical knowledge about a

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:29,130
thing or you have an idea these are some

00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:31,230
of the things that you can do with it

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,270
now the big choice you need to make is

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,640
are you going to build a product or are

00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:39,960
you going to on a service and they both

00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:42,810
have merits it's a very good idea I

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:45,800
believe if you're not familiar with the

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:47,910
idea of running a business or having

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,820
something that you are building that you

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:52,710
are making and you are selling starting

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,510
with a one-off product is a much better

00:15:52,710 --> 00:16:00,150
idea than trying to run a service from

00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:03,120
day one you can write an e-book in a

00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,860
week in fact one of the books i'm going

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,300
to recommend later and was written over

00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,130
cause for a weekend the reason why is

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,780
better is it means that you can go

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:16,740
through the whole process of having the

00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,210
idea building the thing going out there

00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:20,760
marketing it and getting somebody to pay

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,370
for it without having to put in place

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:27,390
the support costs of running it so after

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,860
and it's in really important that if

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,500
you're going to go down this route that

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,200
you experience the whole journey from

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,960
idea through to sail an ongoing support

00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:39,350
because it is so easy to have the idea

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,670
have the fun of building it and then go

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,770
how I'm going to sell it now I don't

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,740
haven't thought about that there that's

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,840
the important bit if you don't make the

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,730
step of finding somebody that wants to

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:52,550
buy it

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,680
preferably before you've built it and

00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:56,920
then sending it through them you don't

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:59,899
have a business you've got a hobby and

00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:01,550
that's perfectly valid thing to do as

00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:03,380
long as you realize that that's what

00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:05,059
you're doing if you think that you're

00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,370
trying to run a business but you are in

00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:09,530
fact having a hobby if you're not gonna

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,380
have an enjoyable experience because you

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:14,329
will run out of money so the one off

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,569
things you can do is product you could

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:18,679
write an e-book I've got an example of

00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,290
somebody that's made a lot of money out

00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,720
of doing that later you could write the

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,360
course so if example you have to be the

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,970
expert in I don't know jjang jjang go

00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,980
pipes or whatever that's a terrific idea

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,809
its new technology that people will want

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,600
to know about somebody should be writing

00:17:32,809 --> 00:17:39,740
that book or that course offering the

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,980
online training so this is a product is

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:47,270
great for a side project or first

00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:51,140
project but whether bigger more

00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:54,620
long-term money seems to be in is in

00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,780
service related businesses because then

00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:59,660
you get the holy grail of the recurring

00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:03,530
revenue that every month a customer is

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:05,450
going to pay you money every month the

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,040
nature of that though is you likely to

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,450
get support costs is a bit it's a bigger

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:15,410
operation that you need to think about

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:19,549
and you have to commit to being

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:22,250
available to do that support 24 x 7 365

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:24,559
days a week so if you're solo founder

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,049
like me you might not want to do that

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,620
because because you might want to go on

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:32,510
holiday or come to conferences but the

00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,710
idea that you have a service or a

00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,720
website that's sitting there making

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,299
money whilst you do things you want to

00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,740
do is one as an idea that works for me

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:45,410
very well and then the other thing that

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,910
you can do is to publish now publishing

00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:49,820
used to mean writing a book or watching

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:53,390
a blog but now it also means doing a

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,780
video blog doing a YouTube doing

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,520
podcasts on that honor on the subject

00:18:55,780 --> 00:19:00,590
now and this is great but not just

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,720
because you can potentially monetize it

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,690
to make to make my

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,580
out of what you're doing but by doing

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:08,590
that publishing by producing that

00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:12,340
podcast what you do is position yourself

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,840
as an authority you may be an expert you

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,700
may be the world-class expert in a

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,260
particular field but if nobody knows

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:21,340
about it why will they contract with you

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,640
why would they ask you for the

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:29,320
consulting why would they ask you to fix

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:31,030
their problems so and there's various

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:33,100
ways to monetize and I could do an

00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,170
entire session just on the question of

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:40,540
monetization but here's just a few

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:42,670
headings direct sale biting a book used

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,950
to be something you did through an

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,210
official publisher like O'Reilly now

00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,210
it's becoming much more common that

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,890
people self publish the technical books

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:52,510
for many reasons one of which is you

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,980
don't have to ask permission you don't

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:55,750
have to convince anybody else it's a

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:58,300
good idea you just get out there and do

00:19:55,750 --> 00:20:01,120
it but also the time to market is much

00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,690
faster I have a friend who was written a

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,290
book who completed it last year it's

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,430
ready to go but the traditional

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,110
publisher isn't actually going to

00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:14,470
release it till the book fair next year

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:17,380
now that's two years of no income from

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,270
that book but it's ready self-published

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:23,290
he'd be able to be earning from it right

00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:25,450
now affiliate Commission is something

00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,970
which can work well if you do it in a

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:30,400
way which is not cheesy so if you buy a

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,870
book through my site for example then I

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,790
get an affiliate Commission form amazon

00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:36,100
from Apple it doesn't cost you any more

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:40,510
but I make the money for connecting you

00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:42,670
with that with that vendor okay if it's

00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:45,700
done well it can work nicely some sites

00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:47,740
tend to just push things at you whether

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,630
they're good whether you want them or

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,030
not and then I find that cheesy I don't

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:54,880
like that same with advertising

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:59,440
advertising can be a very good way of

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,910
monetizing a website or service but only

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,260
when it's done well you don't want to

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,840
have the advertising become the point

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,210
it's supposed to match the offering of

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,550
what you're trying to to sell and

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,020
fightin it's useful

00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:14,000
sponsorship is something setting a lot

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:18,110
with podcasts at the moment so if you

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,450
are writing for example meteor is a

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,330
subject going to come to later that they

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,460
do a podcast where it's sponsored by the

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:29,150
kind of company that would host a meteor

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,370
website so what you're doing by

00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:33,290
providing that podcast is finding them

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:37,850
the audience that they want so they can

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:39,980
do have a targeted advert in the is

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,720
formless sponsorship on that podcast to

00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:44,300
people who exactly the target audience

00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,250
for who they want to reach and then the

00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:48,020
other thing which you can package open

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,540
cell which is what I've also made some

00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,540
money from with the book side is data

00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:56,090
analytics so because i have this website

00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:57,590
i have a lot of data about what people

00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,800
actually do when they're buying an

00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:04,850
e-book and that data by itself is a

00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,890
valuable product now i will say to

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:08,600
anybody that's some sunny thinking i use

00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,450
loves me what about the privacy aspect i

00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,960
don't sell individual data i sell bulk

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,700
aggregated data so i can say for example

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:20,800
this book that you've never heard of is

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,800
racing up through people's wish lists

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:26,630
but i won't give you some real examples

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:29,630
of people that like you who have gone

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:33,890
down this path and made some serious

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,460
money from it so people think you can't

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:43,730
make money out of writing a book this

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:45,080
example for me says otherwise meteor is

00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,890
its web framework but for doing the

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,840
all-time data the documentation that

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,210
came with it wasn't particularly good

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,430
although the technology was found tux

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,530
today so these two people Sasha grief

00:22:55,430 --> 00:23:00,860
and tom coleman decided to write a book

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:02,810
and a website to support that they

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,960
packaged it such that you could choose

00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:08,000
what level of book you wanted to buy so

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,430
I think there was a $29 option which was

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,590
just the book there was a $59 book which

00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,690
was the which was the version of the

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:18,440
book with some training videos and then

00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:20,600
there was the the high-end option where

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,080
you got customized support or something

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,420
like that

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:25,190
so there's a case study that they did

00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,340
with gum mode which was the company they

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:31,940
were sailing at to 300,000 dollars in 18

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,530
months from a book it's gonna be more

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,270
than that now because that the book is

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:38,570
still necessary to understand how to use

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,710
meteor it's also if you're thinking of

00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,180
writing a book I would recommend you

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,850
check out their website because it is

00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:47,180
the best example I have found of how to

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:50,570
write a technical book it's just

00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,890
beautiful and it's the framework that I

00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,860
would choose to use if I were writing

00:23:51,890 --> 00:24:00,050
one but three hundred thousand dollars

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:02,420
one book self-published people say you

00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:04,190
can't start a business a real business

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:07,550
if you're just a solo founder well does

00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:12,200
anybody here use balsamic yeah pelle d

00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:14,570
started that in his back bedroom last

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,270
time I've seen some public figures on

00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:19,850
this annual profits running at 2 million

00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:24,830
it's got a stuff about 26 now and they

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:27,950
all work remotely this is a beautiful

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:30,890
example of how somebody found a sweet

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:32,660
spot in the market built something that

00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:34,880
he wanted to use himself started selling

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,810
it listen to his customer base and

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,430
developed it he's had at least one offer

00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:43,160
to buy that business which she's chosen

00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:44,810
not today because he he thinks he can do

00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,030
better for his customer base by staying

00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,640
as an independent company but it shows

00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,910
what you can do one person two million

00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,430
dollars people say you can't do this

00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:58,190
unless you live in the USA well i have

00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,200
to say i can say that that's wrong

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:03,860
because my biggest customer when i was

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,380
doing the book data service was in New

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:09,080
York this but publisher he was in a pair

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,200
was American publisher I've never even

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:13,640
met them and yet I made I think about a

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:18,530
hundred thousand dollars from that

00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:20,960
contract with company I've never met if

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:22,700
you follow packing you she might heard

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,490
of a guy called patio 11 Patrick

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:28,250
McKenzie he has run a number of

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,930
businesses he's awesome by the way if

00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:33,140
you get a chance to follow anything he

00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,190
says he really knows his stuff he was

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,799
running

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,870
successful small business self started

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,169
called bingo card creator he lives in

00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:44,139
Japan he then started doing some he

00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:48,049
discovered that he had a real talent for

00:25:44,139 --> 00:25:50,149
marketing software product and so he was

00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:53,570
being hired by people at fall creek

00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:55,070
software and major US companies to help

00:25:53,570 --> 00:26:00,320
them sort out what their strategy should

00:25:55,070 --> 00:26:03,440
be whilst living in Japan and here's the

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,539
thing when when people start to think

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,309
about trying to build something for

00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:09,110
themselves and make money from it the

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:12,730
most common reaction is but I can't I

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:15,740
can't do that I can't do that because oh

00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,350
whatever list of excuses reasons that

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,110
you may have I don't believe that I

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,509
believe that anybody in this room could

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:25,970
if they wanted to I'm not saying that

00:26:23,509 --> 00:26:28,879
you should I'm just saying that if you

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,990
wanted to you have the skills to be I to

00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,850
do this and it doesn't matter how

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:36,470
introverted you are it doesn't matter

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:39,379
how busy you are it doesn't matter what

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:41,720
your reason for her go oh no I can't do

00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:43,580
that you can yes you can and i want to

00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,139
show you an example here which some do i

00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:52,100
find totally inspiring john mallow is

00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:54,519
paralyzed from the neck down he has to

00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:58,519
have 24 x seven support to do the basic

00:26:54,519 --> 00:27:00,710
things of living and yet despite being

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:02,509
paralyzed with muscular atrophy from

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,629
from the neck down he has managed to

00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:08,179
build a successful business he's his

00:27:05,629 --> 00:27:10,970
particular talents is in computing so

00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:14,360
and blogging so he ones call says he

00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:16,700
writes a data right services about how

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:21,289
to be a better blogger and he ones that

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:25,940
company from his wheelchair he in all

00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:27,620
normal normal forms of business people

00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:30,500
would say he was probably unemployable

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,090
and yet he's employed himself and he's

00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,659
made a really good business and a

00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:37,190
terrific life from Fond bound so don't

00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:43,399
think you can't do it if he can do it

00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:44,690
you can so i have a few final thoughts

00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:46,850
which

00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:51,230
don't really fit into a particular

00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:53,540
category but it's okay to start small in

00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,000
fact i'd encourage it because what you

00:27:53,540 --> 00:28:00,320
need to do is to learn the business of

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:03,170
being in business you need to understand

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,270
what it means to file your tax returns

00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:07,280
on time because if you're doing a

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,180
corporate business the rules are

00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,730
different than if you're self-employed

00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:12,020
if your VAT registered it's different

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:14,390
than if you're not if you're doing

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,820
business in if you're in it say in the

00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,620
UK and you're dealing business dealing

00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,360
with businesses in the letter V you

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,450
you've got a whole different level of

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,530
bureaucracy to to cope with those things

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:29,440
matter as much as being as good as you

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:33,710
can for the thing you are trying to sell

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:36,410
so start small but finish one of the

00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,060
books that that I recommend is by a

00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,910
woman called Amy hoy I don't know if

00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:45,590
you've heard of her amazing woman her

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:48,140
book is called just because what

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,150
you learn by shipping product to

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:53,780
completion and having a happy customer

00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:56,180
is something you cannot buy in a book

00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,910
you can only learn that experience by

00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:00,740
doing it and the only way you do it is

00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:04,570
by doing it through to actually

00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:08,110
finishing the job and it's okay to fail

00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:12,910
now I had a business in trader the.com

00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:12,910
that would be a failure by anybody's

00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:19,760
anybody's criterion eight years i think

00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,430
i've raised about half a million pounds

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,430
for that in that eight years we made

00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:28,730
profit in two months that's not a

00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:32,000
successful business however the business

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:34,070
failed the idea failed but I did not

00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,740
fail i am not a failure because i had a

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,130
business which did not work what I had

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,510
was a learning experience most

00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:43,880
businesses don't get it right the first

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:46,700
time and this is one of the things we

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,430
especially technology related business

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,230
founders sometimes struggle with because

00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,300
we're used to getting everything right

00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,220
you know the nature of coming through

00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:58,160
the exam system at school when you do

00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:58,530
science related subjects is you expect

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,180
to be a

00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,830
to get ninety two hundred percent on the

00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,770
exams because you know how to do the

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,870
math question the physics question and

00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,950
suddenly the real world is not like that

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:11,580
the real world you have to do

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:14,790
experiments that don't work to find the

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,250
ways through that do work so it is ok to

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:21,300
fail just don't make the same mistake

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,830
twice and it's okay to think big you may

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,990
just want to start writing little

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:29,430
wordpress plugin just to try that

00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:30,450
experience that's fine but always having

00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:32,400
it in back of your mind thinking well

00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:34,710
where could I take this if I was going

00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,480
to try and do this 10 times bigger what

00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:38,550
would the next step be to do there how

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,890
do i get 10 times bigger 100 times

00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:44,100
bigger because it was all usually away

00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,080
and as a small nimble tech related

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,000
company you have the ability to move

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,520
much faster than some of the beer loss

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,970
of the corporate world so you can take

00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:57,570
advantage of that if you have a choice

00:30:53,970 --> 00:31:00,800
between b2b and b2c which means business

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:03,360
the business or business to consumer

00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,940
choose business to business every time

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,100
and i'll tell you why because they are

00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,940
used to spending running whereas most

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,830
consumers don't like spending money

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:16,290
example in the book world if you try to

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:18,420
sell an e-book that's a fiction we're

00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,730
now conditioned to understand that an e

00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:24,390
book on kindle should be ninety nine

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:26,520
pence two dollars cheap cheap cheap if

00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,230
you're doing a business-related book in

00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,700
your selling devoutly it is perfectly

00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:31,380
acceptable to be to be selling it for

00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,060
twenty nine dollars fifty nine dollars

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:34,770
two hundred dollars the most expensive

00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:41,310
book has ever been sold through my

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:44,480
website was 1250 it was i think it was a

00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:44,480
set of building regulations

00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,850
and the other thing about when you're

00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,230
starting up you get to decide what it is

00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:55,140
you're doing nobody's going to tell you

00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,940
you you decide what kind of business you

00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,390
want which means choose the customers

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:03,320
you want and price accordingly so if you

00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,909
make the choice to have high-end

00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,970
expensive customers are willing to spend

00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:12,750
large amounts of money with you don't

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:16,289
price cheap because if you price cheap

00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:18,149
you'll get cheap customers and charge

00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:20,429
more this is thing that Patrick McKenzie

00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:24,390
has taught me over the years he has this

00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:25,950
man sir charge charge more first of all

00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:28,289
you have to charge because until you've

00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,970
taken somebody's money but is not your

00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:32,309
friend your mother you saw your sister

00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:34,289
whatever a person that you do not know

00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:35,730
his handed over their credit card online

00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:37,529
to you and you've taken their money

00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,820
until you've done that you don't know

00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:40,679
whether anybody actually wants what

00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:42,179
you've got so you must charge because

00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:46,380
that's the only way of validating your

00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,730
idea and then charge more because nobody

00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,559
chart is enough to start with because

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:51,659
you think know how that happened I have

00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,770
built something that's worth worth this

00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:57,659
amount of money w prices triple devices

00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:59,130
ten times your vices see what happens I

00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,070
got taught when I was out on the sales

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:05,090
trips with spider by a Salesman if he

00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:08,059
didn't lose fifty percent of his sales

00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,830
deals on price he wasn't charging enough

00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:14,220
and I found a really interesting idea

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,510
that it's ok not to win the sales do to

00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,980
make that work you have to have enough

00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:19,200
of a pipeline that you can try out that

00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,669
experiment but the higher you can put

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,770
your voice is the better service you can

00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:25,830
deliver to your customers and you'd be

00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:27,510
surprised what they can pay when I did

00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,760
the book deal with the publisher I

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,770
hadn't got a clue how much to charge and

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,570
so when we agreed what I was going to

00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,370
deliver he'd ask me for the price I was

00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:37,110
coming and earning about it I said I

00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:40,159
really don't know how to how to price

00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:42,000
for this and he went so I left it to him

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,730
inadvertently and he said look we need

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,490
to get this sorted how about I I pay you

00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:48,809
what I pay the AdWords people so an any

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,039
named applies which was like at least

00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:53,010
three times what I would have thought of

00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:54,750
charging so I felt great yep I can work

00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:56,940
with that

00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:58,140
showed if I'd left it to myself I would

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:04,050
have totally under under price what I

00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:05,070
was doing and my final thought well I

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:08,100
have actually one other thought which

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:09,720
isn't on this which is if you've got any

00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:14,120
idea about going into business whether

00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:17,159
it's a side project or a big big startup

00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,320
practice presentation skills you're

00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,669
going to need them and this is one of

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,669
the common things that we as techies

00:34:20,669 --> 00:34:25,770
feel very unhappy about doing standing

00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:30,030
up here speaking to a room full of

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:32,399
people is really it's scary but it's

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:36,149
also fun and you can learn how to do

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,659
this I mean I am a very shy person I'm a

00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:41,520
very introverted person but most people

00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:43,980
who know me don't think that because

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,899
they think I stand on a stage by myself

00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:50,310
talking to an audience of hundreds at

00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:53,310
must be an outgoing extrovert I've just

00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,350
taught myself how to do this and so I

00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,510
would thoroughly encourage you if you've

00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,340
never spoken in public before start now

00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,670
you doesn't have to be a talk like this

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,990
go to your local meetup we won one in

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:05,750
Scotland will always try to encourage

00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,310
people do a five-minute ten-minute talk

00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:09,360
sign up for Howard's lightning talks if

00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:11,940
you have done one before it's a

00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:14,190
brilliant way to start because what can

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:15,750
go wrong you know five minutes anybody

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,360
can talk about something they care about

00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:20,730
45 minutes give it a go and then you

00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,250
learn how to solve the problems of

00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:26,340
actually doing a presentation like for

00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:29,280
example I know my knees get nervous so

00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,010
my knees my knees shake quite a lot when

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,540
I'm feeling uncomfortable but then I

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,320
wear loose trousers so you don't know

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,850
that because you can't see them shaking

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,320
things like that you learn by doing and

00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,440
this is the common thing about being in

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,080
business you only learn by doing so get

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,150
out there and start doing it my final

00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:50,010
thought start mailing list this is the

00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:52,680
single most useful business tool that
