The BBC micro:bit is a small programmable device for children. A
million of them have been handed out to the UK's 11 and 12 years olds.
The Python Software Foundation was a partner in this moon-shot scheme
and, thanks to the efforts of Damien George, MicroPython runs on the
device.

My talk will tell the story of the project, describe Python's role in
it and explain how the wider Python community can become involved. It
may involve demonstrations, live coding and audience participation.
