	Nicholas Tollervey - A Million Children (and MicroPython)
[EuroPython 2016]
[18 July 2016]

The BBC micro:bit is a small programmable device for children. A
million of them have been handed out to the UK's 11 and 12 years olds.
The Python Software Foundation was a partner in this moon-shot scheme
and, thanks to the efforts of Damien George, MicroPython runs on the
device.

My talk will tell the story of the project, describe Python's role in
it and explain how the wider Python community can become involved. It
may involve demonstrations, live coding and audience participation.

okay everyone um I am really happy to

00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,780
introduce Nikolas stole away and he's

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,400
going to tell you about an amazing story

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,470
vote on 1 million kilts and the micro

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:26,519
bit so please give a big hand for

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:31,140
necklace thank you well good afternoon

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,570
euro pison arm so my name is Nicholas

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,030
and it's a great pleasure to be talking

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,390
to you this afternoon for those of you

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,129
who don't know me I'm a classically

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:43,649
trained musician this is what I used to

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:46,379
do I'm a tuba player i'm also a

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,340
philosophy graduate and i also write

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,800
books for o'reilly mainly and in a

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,469
previous life i used to be a

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,020
schoolteacher and this is me on my first

00:00:55,469 --> 00:01:00,329
day as a fully qualified teacher with my

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,670
new form and these were a bunch of an 11

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,799
year old children in what in the UK we

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,290
call year 7 so year 7 is when you turn

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,770
from 11 to 12 years old can you spot the

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,490
only person who is ignoring the dress

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,350
code of wearing a tie at the school I

00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,939
never wore a tie at that school and at

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,799
the very end they didn't buy me a time

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,990
when I left either so I'm not the only

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,200
person who's spoken at your apartment

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,650
about education I'm sure you remember

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,040
this is my friend carrie Ann who gave a

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,040
barnstorming keynote last year about

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,479
pipe in education I'm not quite sure

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,970
what it is that she's wearing but she

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,799
appears to be very pleased about it so I

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,570
believe it's a helmet with raspberry

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,970
PI's on it maybe it's sort of some brain

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,220
wave device I'm not quite sure anyway I

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,610
hope you can remember what it is that

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:58,950
carrie Ann said at the very end of her

00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,630
talk and then thirdly I think everyone

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,460
should read this book it's called Python

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:05,460
in education by Nicholas Holliday who is

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,459
here it's a really small book I believe

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,840
it's free it's my Riley book anyway so

00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,190
you all got a voucher so you should just

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,170
go and get this even if it's not free

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,330
and you should read it because it really

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:18,390
help explain about Python in education

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,590
and so this is all jus for next year so

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,360
make sure you write this in your diaries

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:26,489
and your planners I will be checking so

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,620
she set some homework and I hope you've

00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,270
done it because I'm here to collect it

00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,680
for her and take it back to the UK so

00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:34,530
she can give it a mark actually no I'm

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,620
not actually I'm here to tell you a

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:40,290
story about how since about this time

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,720
last year the UK's Python community has

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,030
stepped up and worked with the BBC and

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,540
other organizations to deliver an

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,989
educational project but before I explain

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,060
what that project is I want to give you

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:57,299
some history so this is my first

00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:00,630
computer it's a BBC microcomputer and in

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:04,440
the 1980s every school in the UK got one

00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:06,930
of these and my father was a head

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,180
teacher and so I was either though seven

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,640
or eight years old bad as old as my son

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,450
who SAT over there and my dad brought it

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,069
home wanting to learn how to use this so

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,720
he could use it in school and it took my

00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,320
brother and I about half an hour to

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,690
figure out what the future was going to

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,340
do so this is a simulation of a BBC

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,890
micro and I'm going to have to program

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,130
this looking over my shoulder I hope you

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,170
forgive the typos and things so I

00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:40,190
remember my first computer program it

00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,190
was this is BBC basic

00:03:49,190 --> 00:04:02,080
what goes on line 30 go to 20 yes okay

00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:02,080
haha I've insulted you all there we go

00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,450
so um David Allen who is the project

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,100
producer explained that the aim was to

00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,080
democratize computing and we didn't want

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,020
people to be controlled by technology

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,790
but to control it and for the sort of

00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:20,450
eight-year-old me this was a moment a

00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:22,250
revelation I could I could tell people

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:25,540
that they are an idiot automatically

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:28,190
with a computer this was awesome and I

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,890
suspect that you guys have all had a

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:32,420
very similar experience where one day

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,040
you were typing something into a

00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,230
computer and you made it do something

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,330
and you thought yes this is great I can

00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,940
make a computer do a wonderful thing

00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,470
there's a sense of not just power but

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,000
the fact that you can explore what this

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:48,080
thing can do what remarkable things it

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,840
can do so fast forward to today and the

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,900
BBC want to get back into the education

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,250
space and help in the UK and they

00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,020
created something called the micro bit

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,270
project and this is the trailer that

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,620
they've been showing on BBC TV over the

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,810
summer in the future hover shoes click

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,210
button hologram of your name comes up

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,830
Scherzer like a nap in front of gear

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:16,220
inside the fabric is Wi-Fi Wi-Fi yes yes

00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,770
oh yeah oh that gives me an idea we know

00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:30,230
his shoes trampoline his shoes that

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:33,140
would hover that is rubbish so you read

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,270
that right at this moment in time 1

00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:38,300
million of these small computing devices

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,180
have being handed out to this year's

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,140
year seven in UK the 11 year olds like

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:46,340
the kids in my form and the aim is to

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,800
rekindle that sense of wonder in

00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,290
computing and it's a sort of foster a

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,510
can-do attitude with computing rather

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:55,070
than becoming consumers of Technology

00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,990
not asking what this technology can do

00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,580
so we sort of cherished creativity and

00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,340
exploration over rote learning and

00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,400
tested things so how was this delivered

00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,750
well

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,320
I can stand up now because I don't need

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,790
to time the BBC got together with a

00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,280
bunch of partners some of whom are

00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:13,229
listed here um they range from big

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,479
multinationals like arm and Microsoft

00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:19,199
down to community sort of projects like

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:20,430
the code club and and universities like

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
lancaster university who did an awful

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,990
lot of work for this um and also the

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,490
Python Software Foundation I'm a psf

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,830
fellow and when I heard about this

00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,289
project I asked the board whether it be

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:32,729
appropriate for me to contact the BBC

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:34,770
and say the BBC would like to be a

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:36,690
partner and they said yes and we were

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,850
kind of accepted on the program because

00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:41,669
the BBC said that they would like to use

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:43,500
Python with this device pointing is but

00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,120
one of four languages that this device

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,889
supports but obviously I'm going to talk

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,199
to you about Python this being your a

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:50,580
Python and so when this device was

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,860
announced and here's the the press

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,419
release here the psf were just going to

00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,889
be education partners we were only going

00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:59,910
to provide educational resources and

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:02,910
somebody else is going to provide their

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,500
Python runtime as we're um and then I

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:05,910
don't know about this time last year the

00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,860
BBC got in touch with me and said the

00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,410
person who's going to do python has

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:14,970
dropped out and we need Python on the

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:18,030
micro VIP can you help out hmm so I was

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:20,940
in a bit of a pickle there but um I met

00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,740
somebody called aha Johnny from arm

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,810
that's how he introduced himself hello

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,460
I'm johnny from arm it's a strange

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:33,030
surname anyway he he lived next door to

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,949
a chap called Damian George johnny is

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,260
the person who designed the hardware for

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:39,300
the microwave and Damian as I'm sure

00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:41,639
some of you know created micro Python

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,430
and I've met Damian at python UK so I

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:47,880
got in touch with Damian and Damian got

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,770
hold of one of these devices and we got

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,330
my crew Python to run on the microwave

00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,280
which is remarkable let me tell you a

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,889
little bit about micro Python and so

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,360
Damian is actually a physicist and he he

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,510
created micro Python there's a sort of a

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,010
side project and it's rather a

00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:03,840
remarkable side project if you think

00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,430
about it what should I do I know I'll

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,620
reimplement Python 3 but for

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,080
microcontrollers so we have a complete

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,400
re-implementation of Python 3 running on

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,380
microcontrollers it's a remarkable

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,590
achievement and Damian is an

00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,650
outstandingly

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:20,730
talented developer he ran an

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,320
extraordinarily successful Kickstarter

00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:26,110
where he raised enough money to actually

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,750
get get micro Python out into the world

00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,070
on something called a pie board like I

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,380
said as a full reimplement ation of

00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:35,130
Python 3 it runs on lots of different

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,770
sorts of microcontroller based hardware

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,120
there's a flourishing community and it's

00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,520
a sort of a testament really todanians

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,680
talent and determination that micro

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,940
python is the success that it is and we

00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,830
have it running on one of these devices

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,750
the other thing the BBC wanted us to do

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,490
was prove it to provide a code editor

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,470
for children to use so this is an online

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,960
code editor that I wrote it's a

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,550
javascript-based affair and kids go to

00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,990
the website the BBC website they choose

00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:00,610
one of the four languages they type in

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,920
whatever their code is and they click

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,050
the download button they get a hex file

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,680
that they copied onto the device and

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,970
then the program runs okay um but we

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,710
discovered when we were testing this

00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,720
with teachers and students in the autumn

00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,970
that actually what we need to do was

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,430
build a whole ecosystem around this

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,110
remarkable device so Damien and I met in

00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:23,410
London just before we went to a meeting

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:26,770
to the for a meeting to the BBC over a

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:30,880
cup of coffee and we drew up what we saw

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:32,440
a vision of this ecosystem to be very

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,810
mind that we're all volunteering our

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,580
time here as well so this is all all

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:38,230
about motivating a community to get

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,480
involved too so you've kind of got touch

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,580
develop which is Microsoft offering into

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,550
which we slotted that web-based Python

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,770
editor but we people were telling us

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,810
that actually they prefer writing code

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:51,100
in a proper editor as it were an editor

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,980
that they could use on their desktop

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,450
rather than having to go online and also

00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,670
they wanted to choose which editor they

00:09:55,450 --> 00:10:00,220
wanted to use and they wanted to go to a

00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:03,430
site where they could where they could

00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,530
find out more about specifically Python

00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,810
so we needed a cross-platform native

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,790
editor we needed tools the command line

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,830
so you could flash the device without

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,720
having to use the specialist editor we

00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,670
needed projects to inspire others as

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,440
well and we needed a website to sort of

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,580
spread the Python in education with word

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,520
so we got to work this is new you'll

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,920
maybe get the joke it's a very small

00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,420
simple Python editor for children

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,930
currently it's aimed

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,060
at at the micro bit but we have plans to

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:40,899
make it available for other sorts of

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:42,310
types of Python development and so what

00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:45,190
you will see is when I'm doing that live

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:51,010
code demo in a minute i'll be using you

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:53,949
to make that happen so i also want to

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:55,600
mention that while mu is the whole

00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:57,579
philosophy of me is that you have sort

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,839
of a zero effort to get you to where you

00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,120
need to be it's the simplest possible

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,040
editor kids get coding straight away and

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,480
there's no impediment to them this is

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,949
part of a wider movement that's going on

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:11,110
in the UK um started by Dan Pope which

00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:13,300
you can hear a talk about this later on

00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:16,240
then created a project called PI game 0

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:19,329
so this is an API that sits on top of my

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,920
game for children so again it's a zero

00:11:19,329 --> 00:11:24,720
effort you should be able to write a

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:28,149
game with little or no upfront

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,649
boilerplate we have gpio zero by Ben not

00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:32,769
all from the raspberry pi foundation a

00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,990
similar sort of project for the GPIO

00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:37,930
pins on a raspberry pi we have network 0

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,779
as well which is the my friend called

00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:42,699
Tim which is based upon 0 and Q again

00:11:40,779 --> 00:11:45,279
it's a very thin wrapper on the top but

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:46,540
it's child friendly ok so we're asking

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,570
ourselves what other things could we'd 0

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,070
as well maybe you can put your thinking

00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:55,290
hats on and come up with something

00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:59,010
something else 0 that's a child friendly

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:01,449
library for kids to use and so the

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,399
summary is it's a child simple friendly

00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:05,500
simple child friendly api's on top of

00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:08,920
real modules um remember i mentioned

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,420
tooling so this is a micro flash which

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,680
is a command line tool and a module that

00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:13,480
you can use to interact with the device

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,790
it will detect where your devices and

00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,930
you can use it to flash your scripts so

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,910
you can write your script in whatever

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,220
editor you want you use it to flash your

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,510
script onto the device so you have the

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,970
freedom to choose whatever tools that

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,240
you want you just use micro flash to to

00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:30,010
do it yourself um now most of the work

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,069
on micro place them on the market it was

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:35,829
done on one single device which Damien

00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:37,779
had and the BBC gave the psf five more

00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:40,000
and we wanted to know how are we going

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,170
to engage with the community so that

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,579
they produce resources that are inspired

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,130
two children that will get people

00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:48,920
interested in this and so we did a world

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:51,350
tour and the microbe it went all over

00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,029
the place at the South Pole it got sent

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,519
with the British Antarctic Survey down

00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:59,240
to the South Pole to Australia to us all

00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,120
around Europe and we got rather a lot of

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,630
really cool projects out of it now a

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,459
radomir from poland created a robot

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:09,800
which i was going to show you a video

00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:13,089
off but this morning actually radomir

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,709
turned up and he said he's seen this and

00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:17,839
this is his little micro bit robot but

00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:19,699
he's he's improved and I'm going to put

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,470
it on the table here and I'm going to

00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:24,279
flick a switch at the back and we'll

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,279
just have to see what happens

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:44,320
ah ok so well done radomir wherever he

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:46,240
is the important thing is that it's the

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,160
micro bit that's controlling this it's

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,570
controlling the motors here the GPIO

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,270
pins here if you look very carefully

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:54,310
there are bolts here that are making the

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:58,930
connections with the with with the

00:13:54,310 --> 00:14:01,350
motors um and with the help and support

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,940
of the python software foundation we

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,850
create we are in the process of creating

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:09,010
a Python in educational website this is

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,050
the initial design for the homepage and

00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:13,510
I hope that some of you consider helping

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,160
out with it because we want to put all

00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:17,290
the resources that we create for not

00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,360
just the micro bit but for raspberry pi

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,500
and all the other amazing Python in

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,570
education things that are happening

00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,940
around the world in a single place so

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:31,170
people can can be inspired and reuse

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,170
these resources so this is demo time

00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:45,040
you don't know how nervous I feel man so

00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:46,450
the problem of having a microbe it is

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,950
that I can't really hold it up and

00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:50,440
you're going yep we can see it at the

00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:53,050
back so I'm going to hold it up like

00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,960
this and give you a quick tour of the

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:59,020
hardware so on the front are five by

00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,390
five LED matrix of these flash you can

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,240
have zero to nine and brightness a

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:06,640
couple of buttons for input across the

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,290
bottom our gpio pins some of which are

00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:11,440
big enough that you can attach crocodile

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,360
clips on the back you can see that this

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,550
is where a battery goes that's a reset

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:21,550
button micro USB port hear is radio so

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,740
you can communicate wirelessly with with

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:25,900
devices if you're reading carefully

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,690
you'll see that the processor is here

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,550
and there's a compass and accelerometer

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:32,380
here as well so it knows what way it's

00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,010
facing and which way north is as well

00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:43,270
okay so that's the overview for hardware

00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:44,620
um this is mu sorry that is me and I'm

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:48,460
going to have to code over my shoulder

00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:52,270
so here's one I prepared earlier this is

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:57,730
the simplest possible script hello world

00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:59,890
and i flash the device and at the back

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:03,570
you can see have gotten LED flashing to

00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,570
say okay that's communication happening

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:12,510
hello well hey it works just fancy that

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,520
okay but we can't we don't have to just

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:26,089
scroll text we can do animation as well

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,220
so displayed show we've got some

00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:32,000
built-in images all clocks isn't our

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:36,350
it's a list of all the kind of ranges of

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,390
a clock hand and it's going to be 100

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,250
milliseconds between each frame of the

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,350
animation and I wanted to just keep

00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:45,260
looping you can see this is very very

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,610
simple code that we hope kids I'm going

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,610
to understand intuitively

00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:59,180
a little radar there we've got going

00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:03,020
okay so it's going to just keep doing

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,240
that until I tell it to stop um a bit

00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:06,650
more advanced example some more of the

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,350
built-in images we've got going on here

00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:12,620
but in not very many lines of Python I'm

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:15,290
choosing X&Y on the LED matrix I'm

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:17,810
setting a random brightness I'm going to

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,250
set that pixel if button a was pressed

00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,199
this is starting to sound like pseudo

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,390
code we've taken a lot of effort to make

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,860
sure that the API that the kids use to

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,350
interact with the microbe it is very

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,690
very simple just show a random image

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,180
from this list here and if button be was

00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:34,850
pressed oh hello world accelerometer was

00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:38,260
gesture shake okay show an angry face

00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,260
let's see what happens when I do

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:55,770
so here's the sparkles and if i press

00:17:50,910 --> 00:18:00,330
button hey are we get smiley face face

00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:05,130
with this time out a rabbit Oh a pacman

00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:07,380
ghosts so on and so on skull and if I

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:08,490
could be we got our hello world program

00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,660
so you can see there's a bit of

00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:17,550
continuity in the code that we've

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:18,780
developed here okay flashing shake it do

00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:21,500
it again you want to see an angry Mike a

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,500
bit just shake it

00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:39,970
okay but wait there's more you're quite

00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:46,420
right so this is the repple this is

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:50,470
Python running on the micro bit so it's

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:53,500

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:10,330
