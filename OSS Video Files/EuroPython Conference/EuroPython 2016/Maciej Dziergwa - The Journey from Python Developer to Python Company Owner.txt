Ten years ago I became a big Python fan, but at the time there were no
jobs for Python developers in Poland. So, I decided to start my own
Python company. Today, ten years later, this company employs more than
100 Python Developers in four cities.

There are a lot of Python enthusiasts in the world, many of them more
skilled than I was at that time, but clearly not anyone can become a
„Python Business Developer”. In this talk I would like to indicate
main keys to success, factors and features that help a developer to
find himself on an independent career path.

My goal is to answear these questions:

How to create employee-friendly work environment for Python developers?

Which business model gives a chance to attract and keep more than 100
Python enthusiast?

I will also gladly share some lessons learned while working with
dozens of clients, dozens of Python frameworks, and lots, lots of
great developers.
