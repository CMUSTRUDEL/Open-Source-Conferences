Python is a great language. Easy to learn, friendly to use, widely used.

It is not, however, renowned for being fast.  In a lot of situations
that does not matter.  Sometimes it really does. This talk will
introduce you to some tools and techniques for making sure your Python
code becomes fast enough – without turning into a maintenance
nightmare. Warning: may contain small bits of other languages.

Python is a great language. Easy to learn, friendly to use, widely used.

It is not, however, renowned for being fast.  In a lot of situations
that does not matter.  Sometimes it really does.  This talk will
introduce you to some tools and techniques for making sure your Python
code becomes fast enough – without turning into a maintenance
nightmare.  Fast code does not have to be unreadable - and when you're
writing Python, it really pays of to think "pythonically".

That does mean using the included batteries, and utilising the
ecosystem of tools around the language, too.
