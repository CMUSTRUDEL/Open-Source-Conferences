As developers we all love well-documented, well-tested packages. If we
do the same for our code it is easier for others to re-use our hard
work, and maybe even contribute. We will take a quick look on how to
do this using popular tools and only a small investment of time. With
Github and some simple tools, setting up a well-groomed package
doesn't have to be difficult.

-----

Every Python open-source developer wants their software to be used. As
developers, we trust software that is tested and well-documented.

In this talk we'll go through 5 steps for how to do this for your own packages.

We will take a quick look on how to do this using popular tools and
small investment of time:

- Write a setup.py script for a pure Python package
- Set up py.test, tox and coverage to test our package with multiple
versions of Python
- Configure Github to use Travis CI & coveralls.io to automatically
test our package every time we commit
- Register and publish our package to PyPI
- Setup our documentation on ReadTheDocs
