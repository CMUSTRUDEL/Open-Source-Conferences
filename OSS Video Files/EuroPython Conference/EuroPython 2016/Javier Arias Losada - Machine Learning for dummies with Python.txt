Machine Learning is the next big thing. If you are a dummy in terms of
Machine Learning, but want to get started with it... there are
options.

Still, thanks to the Web, Python and OpenSource libraries, we can
overcome this situation and do some interesting stuff with Machine
Learning.

overcome this situation and do some interesting stuff with Machine
Learning.
