In this talk discusses some joyful exercises in simulation. I'll
demonstrate it's usefulness but moreover I'll discuss the sheer joy.
I'll discuss how to generate song lyrics, I'll discuss how to get
better at casino games, how to avoid math, how to play monopoly or
even how to invest in lego minifigures. No maths required; just a
random number generator.

In this talk discusses some joyful exercises in simulation. I'll
demonstrate it's usefulness but moreover I'll discuss the sheer joy
you can experience.

I'll go over the following points (the short list):

- I'll show how you can avoid math by simulating; I'll calculate the
probability that two people in the live room have the same birthday.
- I'll show how simulation can help you get better at many games. I'll
start with simple card games and with the game of roulette. Most
prominently I'll discuss how to determine the value of buying an asset
in the game of monopoly (See blogpost: http://koaning.io/monopoly-
simulations.html).
- I'll demonstrate how you can simulate Red Hot Chilli Pepper lyrics.
Or any other band. Or legalese.
- I'll demonstrate the results of a scraping exercise which helped me
to determine the value of investing in Lego Minifigures (See blogpost:
http://koaning.io/lego-minifigs-stochastics-profit.html).

Depending on the level of the audience I might also discuss how biased
simulation can help you solve optimisation problems or even introduce
bayesian statistics via sampling. I'll gladly leave this decision to
the EuroPython committee.
