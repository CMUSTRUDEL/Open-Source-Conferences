Programming is one of the most important 21st-century skills and tons
of different online and offline resources can help you to master it.

On the other hand, playing games is really effective way for us to
learn and it's also the most fun.

But is it possible to learn real programming language like Python by
playing a game?

In this talk I'll show you some projects that allow you to achieve
that. I also want to inspire you to help such projects and to suggest
ideas how to do that.

-----

Programming is one of the most important 21st-century skills. It
doesn't only provide promising career opportunities but teaches how to
reason logically, systematically and creatively.

Code readability, rich standard library, straightforward syntax and
other features make Python a great language for teaching beginners how
to program. Python community is very supportive and friendly to
newcomers and does awesome work to make Python available to everyone.
Tons of different online and offline resources can help you to master
Python programming. Problem solving is the classical way of learning
how to code. But it can be boring for some people, especially for
kids.

On the other hand, playing games is really effective way for us to
learn and it's also the most fun. You can find different games
designed to teach basics of programming, but most of them use special
visual environments and don't teach real text based languages.

But is it possible to learn programming language like Python by playing a game?

In this talk I'll show you a few projects for different age and levels
that allow you to achieve that. I'll pay attention on methods that are
used to teach programming.

I also want to inspire you to help such projects and to suggest ideas
how to do that.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,660
ok let's continue I'm pleased to

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,599
introduce the engineer Liana but glad

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:18,930
see who talks about learning python the

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:21,390
phone away hello everyone thank you all

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,850
for coming to my talk this evening today

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:26,310
I'm going to talk about one interesting

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,400
type of tools that can be used in

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,130
education and i guess some of you

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,940
definitely came here today to find out

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:37,980
how to learn python the fun way ok let

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,070
me get started then first of all a

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,730
little bit about myself my name is Liana

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,739
baccata I am a software developer from a

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:50,520
beautiful russian city code st.

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,980
Petersburg I work for JetBrains and as

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,640
part of my work I am involved in

00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:59,570
development of Pi charm adu which is

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,280
educational edition of my charm ID

00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:07,380
specially designed for Python learners

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:10,080
and educators because of my work in pi

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,049
charum adu project I am in constant

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,270
search for interesting tools and ideas

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,210
for learning and teaching programming

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,330
languages and I'd like to say that

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,170
Python community does awesome job trying

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:26,700
to make bitin available for anyone and

00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:29,270
providing resources for those who want

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,360
to learn it please raise your hands

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:37,320
those who somehow involved in Python in

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,250
education so that's you who do this

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,250
awesome job

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,570
but no offense but going through these

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,180
resources could be a rather boring

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:56,800
process for some people especially for

00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:58,810
kids but what if we could forget that we

00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,140
actually trying to learn something do

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:05,470
something you and just have fun instead

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:10,000
what if we could continue improving our

00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:13,900
skills while doing something fun and we

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,209
could do this playing games has been

00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,780
proven to be one of the most effective

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:23,680
ways for us to learn first of all it

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,440
decreases the fear of failure I am sure

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,750
that all of you have met people who

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,959
thought that they were too stupid for

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:35,410
programming but I have never actually

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,140
met anyone who thought that would they

00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:42,459
were too stupid for condo strike or

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:46,120
Pokemon go and also if you fail a test

00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:49,780
it might have serious consequences and

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,510
it might be rather disappointing but if

00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:55,000
you fail a level in a game there is

00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:59,799
nothing scary about it you can just

00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,830
start again in the games we often get an

00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:05,860
instant reward once you have completed a

00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,989
level you get an achievement and it's

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,850
nice to have a lot of achievement isn't

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:17,500
it when we play a game we usually try to

00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:21,370
win and competition is the moving force

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:25,150
of progress and at last games often

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:27,580
provide good visualization which makes

00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,000
it easier for us to master hard concepts

00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:33,850
at this point lane games seems to be

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,070
very good way for us to learn something

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:38,940
new and of course I'm not the first

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:42,220
person who had an idea to apply to

00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:44,709
programming and today I'm going to show

00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,560
you three projects that are my personal

00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:51,190
favorites just to give you an idea of

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:53,650
how it works and I'm also going to tell

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,680
you how you can help these projects

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,750
other than donate

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,560
the first project is called code combat

00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:06,190
in this game you help a hero to achieve

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,190
some goals on each level it is insanely

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:15,250
cool for children and people with no

00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:18,340
little programming experience they say

00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:21,100
on their website that if you want to

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:23,260
learn programming you need to write a

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,520
lot of code and that's definitely true

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:29,470
but their job is to make sure that you

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,440
are doing this with a smile on your face

00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:35,470
I like this words but let's take a look

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:39,010
how they do that so this is one of the

00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:42,340
levels in code combat our our hero is

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:45,160
stuck in a room with fireballs and we

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,420
need to survive how can we accomplish it

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,540
well we have some equipment it provides

00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:55,570
comments that our hero can do for

00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,390
example simple boots allow us to move to

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,910
different directions and later in the

00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:04,240
game we will get get some sort of

00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:07,690
advanced boot that will allow us to move

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,140
to the specific coordinates we also have

00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:13,060
a salt but that's not very good salt

00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,200
actually because you need to hit an

00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,900
enemy twice to kill it when you first

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,870
see some level they already provide you

00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:26,110
with a code sample and your job is to

00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:28,720
modify it sometimes you need to add some

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,540
lines and sometimes you need to modify

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:37,540
conditions or something else you can

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:41,410
also run it and see what goes wrong let

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:44,980
me show how it works at first with on it

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:47,950
first we see that our hero dies because

00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:52,000
he moves only to the right then we fix

00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:55,960
our code and run it again this time

00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,130
everything is okay and yay we get some

00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:03,910
XP and gems that can be spent to buy

00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:07,120
better equipment I also like that they

00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:08,289
can in some way analyze your code for

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,080
example in this

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:15,069
case i misspelled the name of one of my

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:17,830
enemies and they told me that I made a

00:06:15,069 --> 00:06:20,949
typo so as I don't get frustrated

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,789
because i can't find such a stupid

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:27,759
mistake in my code if you are interested

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:30,189
in this project you're very like because

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,699
there are plenty of ways for you to help

00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:36,999
it this is by far the best contribution

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:41,080
guide I've ever seen it's a screenshot

00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:43,930
from code combat github weekend and they

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:47,680
represent their contributors as game

00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:51,999
characters for example they call coders

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,939
are mages the project is one hundred

00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:57,879
percent open source but it's written in

00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:59,979
CoffeeScript so it's not that easy for

00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,949
Python developers to contribute with

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,379
code but you can actually complete all

00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,990
the levels with coffee script tool so

00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:11,559
you can learn coffeescript with the code

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:14,800
combats help and then way back to it by

00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:18,279
contributing your code but you can also

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,309
help in other ways first of all you can

00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:23,740
help with translation code combat has

00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:26,409
translation too many languages and this

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,719
fact is pretty impressive because we

00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:32,080
don't have so many programming games

00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:39,939
that are translated into languages other

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:42,309
than English this fact okay so there is

00:07:39,939 --> 00:07:45,779
still a lot of work for for you to do a

00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:49,059
lot of levels hasn't been translated yet

00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:52,149
but the best part is that you can

00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:55,869
actually create new levels yourself it's

00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:58,659
not as easy as I'd like it to be they

00:07:55,869 --> 00:08:03,189
still have special editor for creating

00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:05,800
levels and you have you can express your

00:08:03,189 --> 00:08:09,729
creativity and add some bonuses to your

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:13,719
karma the next project is called codon

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:17,110
game and it is known for contests that

00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:20,050
they organized in this contest you can

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,030
compete with other developers in some

00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:25,570
sort of turn-based game

00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:28,720
where you need to write a successful

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:31,930
strategy if you manage to do this the

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,020
chance is high that you will get a good

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:39,160
price or even will be invited to a job

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:41,890
interview if anybody is interested the

00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,890
next contest will be held in September

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:48,850
so you have enough time to prepare and

00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:52,290
sign up but let's now take a look into

00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:56,520
their onboarding puzzle that explains to

00:08:52,290 --> 00:09:00,760
new players how the whole project works

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:03,670
each puzzle has a goal sometimes they

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,270
also give you nice synopsis with

00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:10,480
spaceships or something like that and we

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:14,350
also can see what our code actually does

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,930
in this visualization window the editor

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,970
is previewed with the code that

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:22,390
retrieves all the needed information

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,760
from the standard input so you can

00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:27,520
concentrate on the code that really

00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,850
matters once you've done with the code

00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,790
you can run provided test cases and see

00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:37,210
if your code works good or not for this

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:41,050
test cases they show you all the input

00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:43,630
and they expected I'll output and you

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:47,980
can also see what exactly goes on on

00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:51,730
visualization I'd like now to show you

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,530
how it works but at first I want to

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,520
explain what you need to do in this

00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:59,890
puzzle you need to retrieve coordinates

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,730
of your enemies from the standard input

00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:05,920
and on each turn you decide what enemy

00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:07,900
you are going to shoot but they actually

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:13,600
already tell you that you need to select

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:16,840
the closest enemy to survive okay I've

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,570
already wrote the correct solution and

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,570
let's run the provided test case

00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:29,640
yeah it looks like we survived let's now

00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:34,970
spoil our code and let's select the

00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:38,100
farthest enemy instead run it again and

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:42,990
we are dead because the very first

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:45,540
spaceship got to us and we died this

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,330
project wouldn't be so cool if there

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,640
were no community around it it's really

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:53,430
nice that you can view other people

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,330
solutions and learn from that from them

00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:59,190
but they also have so called community

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,340
puzzles that you can find in the

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:05,490
community puzzles category and you can

00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:08,250
write your own puzzles maybe you can

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:11,520
come up with the idea how to introduce

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,770
the algorithm for finding their array

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,790
maximum for people with some interesting

00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:20,310
story ok the last project is called

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:23,220
check I oh it doesn't have that

00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:26,820
impressive visualization but it still

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:29,910
has the huge content base and the

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:34,220
friendly community the tasks here are

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:37,140
divided into islands and each task

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:40,950
actually is called a mission each

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:43,230
mission has three different states once

00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:45,600
you've done with solution you can

00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,780
publish your code and see what other

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,030
people think about it and maybe you will

00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:54,420
be even like enough to get your code

00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:58,200
reviewed let's now dive into the mission

00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:01,980
called medium your job here is to write

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:05,790
a function called check yo that returns

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:08,460
the median of a list of numbers once we

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:12,030
realized what we need to do we can try

00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,250
to solve this task why not and again we

00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:17,250
see yet another version of text editor

00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:20,850
this time the editor is rather limited

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,710
it has no code completion and instant

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:26,280
error highlighting which would be

00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:29,580
helpful they also have little does

00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:33,120
description to window but they can

00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:35,370
provide you nice Hills chekea provides

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,279
hints in the form of an

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,800
short conversation between two people

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,770
where you asked questions and more

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,190
experienced developer answers you in

00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:50,190
some that tasks they also have nice

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:53,400
visualization feature for you to test

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:56,040
your code on the actual data for example

00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:59,040
in this case you can change the data

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,800
directly on this picture and they will

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,880
show you with the orange line what

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:09,120
median is and you can see if your code

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,970
works let's now see how this

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,830
visualization works at first we will try

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:17,310
to check the solution that always

00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:19,589
returns the first element of a list then

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:24,589
we magically type the correct solution

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:24,589
and try it on different input data

00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:38,300
okay let's change the data yes it seems

00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:41,210
like it works as I've already said

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,600
chiquillos text editor is rather limited

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:47,240
but the good news is that there is a

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:50,540
plugin for pycharm that allows you to

00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,360
complete checking emissions in addition

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,930
to the ability to write solutions in Pai

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,780
Chan and post them directly to check I

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,540
yo without copy pasting it back to the

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:05,300
browser you can view other people

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:09,260
solutions directly in by child change

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:12,170
them and play with them at first all the

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:15,200
missions available at check I all were

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,930
created by the team but now anyone can

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,300
create their own missions in order to do

00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,390
that you need to clone a github

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:26,810
repository write your mission there and

00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,240
suggested back to the check IOT after

00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:32,390
review your mission might become

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:35,330
accepted and might become available for

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:37,550
anyone there is also initiative to

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:41,750
translate check I owed two languages

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:45,290
other than English you can also propose

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:50,120
your solution your translation in form

00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:52,850
of who requests in conclusion I'd like

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,400
to say that even though there are a lot

00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,190
of great resources for learning python

00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:01,160
there is one interesting direction in

00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:05,380
educational tools that can actually

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:08,570
change the way we learn you've just seen

00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:12,560
three great projects that attempt to do

00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:16,820
that and I encourage you to try them and

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,210
maybe to contribute to them but I also

00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:23,600
want to know that it has been plenty of

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:26,210
time since I proposed this talk and no

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,180
great games have gained my attentions in

00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:32,300
them it means that there is a lot of

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:34,970
space for creativity and for you to

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,430
invent something cool in this area for

00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:40,760
example I definitely would enjoy playing

00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:42,449
a game that teaches me jungle of flask

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,629
or nampa

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:50,160
that's all thank you again for coming

00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:52,730
and don't hesitate to find me at by

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,730
Charles

00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:08,189
okay so wats of Hazzard questions

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,300
questions

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:17,510
No

00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,510
Oh

00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:40,160
hello can you talk a bit more about

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,779
Python as you ID because I was not

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,650
worried about it and I don't know

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:48,500
exactly what it does I think you better

00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:52,779
come to me at by charm booth and I can

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,779
make a demo for you okay great

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,840
lust

00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:17,310
thank you very much that's very

00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:19,740
interesting canals and where you're

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:22,530
going next with this anything we haven't

00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,550
told us about that you've got in your

00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:29,990
plans for the future you mean according

00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:32,690
to buy char- and gamification or just

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,760
anything that's in line with your aims

00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:40,400
that you talked about without making

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:44,400
this more fun and more accessible I

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:48,300
think that I should do what I can do and

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:54,510
I should implement these ideas in top I

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:56,390
charm I do and I intend to do that okay

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,550
thank you are for children hazards and

00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:02,510
for your interest conference thank you

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,510
