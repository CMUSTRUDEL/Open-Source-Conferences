You will see several different walking robots controlled with Python
in different ways, and learn how they were built and programmed.

-----

Making a robot walk is not easy, especially when all it has for brains
is a small microcontroller which you have to program in C. During this
talk you will see different ways in which such a robot can be
controlled in Python, either by using remote control, with the Python
program running on a stationary computer, by putting a small computer,
such as a Raspberry Pi on it, or by programming it with Micropython, a
version of the Python language designed for microcontrollers. I will
also explain the basic problems with walking robots and how Python can
be used to overcome them. Finally, I will show some of the robots I
have built.
