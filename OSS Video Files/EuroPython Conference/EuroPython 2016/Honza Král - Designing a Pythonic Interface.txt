When designing an abstraction for a complex system (an ORM-like
library in our case) you face a lot of design decisions and
challenges. This talk details how we chose to tackle those when
designing elasticsearch-dsl.

-----

The json query language for elasticsearch, as well as its other APIs,
can be very daunting to new users and can be a bit cumbersome when
working with python. That is why we created elasticsearch-dsl - a sort
of ORM for elasticsearch.

We will go through the design philosophy and obstacles found during
the development - trying to make a more pythonic interface for
elasticsearch while maintaining access to all of the features of the
underlying query language.

The focus of the talk is more on the library and interface design than
on elasticsearch and its query language itself, that is used only to
demonstrate the principles.
