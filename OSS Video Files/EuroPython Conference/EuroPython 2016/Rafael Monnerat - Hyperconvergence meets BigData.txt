This presentation show how to deploy  **[Wendelin][1]**, the free
software platform for Big Data & Machine Learning, using
**[SlapOS][2]** , the free software hyperconverged Operating System
(hOS).  Written in 100% in Python,  SlapOS and Wendelin, can create a
complete Big Data Infraestruture with out-of-core capabilities ready
to use and operate in just few hours.

-----

This presentation aims to demonstrate how to use [SlapOS][1]
(Hyperconverged OS) to deploy an entire Big Data Infrastrucure and
show how "data life cycle" can be managed with [Wendelin][2] -
covering ingestion, analysis, visualization and weaving it into an
application.

We'll show how Wendelin and SlapOS could handle acquisition, analysis
and exploitation of data, making it a potential solution for IOT
scenarios where data is available and needs some logic applied before
being presented as web application, possibly on a commercial basis.

The agenda of the presentation includes an introduction on SlapOS, as
a tool used to deploy a wide range of different services and an
introduction of Wendelin, as a tool in order to make out-of-core
python applications.

After a short introduction, we progress to show the steps to deploy
SlapOS infrastructure and later to deploy Wendelin on the just
deployed SlapOS, including an use case which shows SlapOS deploying a
fluentd instance to ingest data to the Wendelin Database.

To conclude, we make a live demo with an Jupiter using out-of-core
python to handle wav files stored on Wendelin, and a second short demo
on handle computer resources consumption data.
