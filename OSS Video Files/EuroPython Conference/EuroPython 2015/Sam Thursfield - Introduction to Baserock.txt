The Baserock project is about creating system images from source code
in a clean, reproducible way. All of the tooling is written in Python.

In this talk I'll explain a bit about the core idea of Baserock:
declarative system definitions (expressed in YAML) that can be built
and deployed in various ways.

Then I'll go into more detail about the tools available, and some of
the cool things that they can do: distributed building, atomic system
updates, creating custom container images, and more.
