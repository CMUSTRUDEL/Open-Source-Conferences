	James Robinson - Raspberry Pi Weather Station
[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]

The Raspberry Pi weather station project introduces young people to
using python programming to  solve real and technical problems. The
weather station consists of a range of sensors including:
Anemometer
Rain gauge
Wind Vane
Temperature Probe
Barometer
Air Quality Sensor
Hygrometer

1000 kits are being given away to schools to take part in the project
by following our schemes of work which will involve.
Programming basic interrupt based sensors
Advanced Sensors using ADC chips
Create a pygame based UI
Logging data to MySQL and Oracle Apex
Presenting data to a web app
Deploying the weather station
Integrating Apex database

We would love feedback on the project from Python Developers and
support in updating some libraries from python 2 to 3.

picture image and so just very very

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,870
quickly because I've got half an hour

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,360
and we're gonna try possibly and do the

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:12,210
risky live demo at the end we shall see

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,009
so I'm James I'm an ex teacher I gave a

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,010
talk earlier on about my experiences

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,080
with PyCon and I'm going to talk about

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,369
the rest weather station I've now left

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,279
teaching and I work for the Raspberry Pi

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:24,960
foundation which is the charity side of

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,990
the organization which carry I mentioned

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,820
in her keynote this morning so um before

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:30,929
I get on to the weather station and one

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,489
of the things that we're really

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,680
passionate about and I'm passionate

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,300
about particularly the when we're

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,250
working with students that projects they

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,840
work with should have purpose and we I

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,600
talked about this this morning in my

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,730
talk purpose is really important if the

00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,850
examples that we work that we give kids

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,059
to work with are trite and engineered

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,710
then they don't see the purpose the

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,600
value in them okay so products with

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,980
purpose are really important here are

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,600
three projects that we've got going on

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,010
I've not mentioned Astro Pi here

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,699
although it loosely connect it with the

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,070
space thing requires an event with

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,600
that's going on in later in the year

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,850
we're sending some multipliers to space

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,439
kids are coding

00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,390
Python code to work on those raspberry

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,850
PI's so we could have code being run in

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,460
space from UK kids the reason that pitch

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,979
is there though is this picture the

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,570
Raspberry Pi team took last week with a

00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:26,100
Raspberry Pi on a helium balloon at I

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,720
know much of what altitude this was

00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,990
there it reached an altitude of about 30

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,880
to 32 kilometers this picture is

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,100
actually off one of my favorite ones and

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,100
it's actually picture three one four

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,869
which is quite apt so we're doing this

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,850
with some kids as well and teachers and

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:43,950
showing kids how we can use programming

00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:46,170
science engineering technology to do

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,670
cool stuff this middle of picture this

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,590
is the weather station kit which and we

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,240
were talking about in a second and over

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,579
here the reason the pitchers got cropped

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,439
you can just about see it here we've got

00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,299
a little greenhouse next to a plant been

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,119
who did a talk earlier on spoke briefly

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,070
about this this is a greenhouse project

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,350
that allows kids to write code to

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,030
monitor their power plants and flash

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,550
little LEDs to the health kind of

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,590
reflects the health of the plant so

00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,570
projects with purpose really important

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:15,370
and

00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:17,950
when I was just leaving teaching I was

00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,900
given one of the prototype boards which

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,030
looked quite different to this it was a

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,460
lot bigger and it's been re-engineered

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:27,190
slightly and we boys were given to

00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,690
schools we coded them we got them set up

00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,940
with the kids we talked about how

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,220
weather data is collected and we

00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,870
installed one in our schools so the very

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,340
last day one of the last things I did

00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,710
was I'll get in the caretaker drilling

00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,180
holes in the wall feeding cables out so

00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,400
I could leave this weather station in

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,020
place so let's just have a quick look

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,810
around the hardware through we've got

00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:49,960
here so this is what we'd call a

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,520
Raspberry Pi hat it sits on top of the

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,920
Raspberry Pi it connects with the

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,570
mounting holes and it connects where

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,580
we've got the GPIO header that sits on

00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,750
top of the pins I've got one in the case

00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,200
if and almost to have a closer look

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,930
later on and then those two parts snap

00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,000
off and form two separate parts of the

00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,830
weather station you've got the main

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,350
board which I've got holding here in

00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,720
this case and this is gonna be in a

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,430
watertight case and then you've also got

00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,980
the smaller case which contains an air

00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,630
quality sensor so on this one you remove

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,090
all the rubber bones that one's open to

00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,470
the air so that the air can circulate

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,850
and you separate those two out and they

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:29,080
communicate over I squared C so they're

00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:30,880
the main parts of the weather station

00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,870
but we connect up to the weather station

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:36,310
with a series of sensors so we've got

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,170
and this is all just standard kit you

00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,820
know we just store in the UK called

00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,890
Merkel in this is what weren't really

00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,590
the same kind of kit they stock in there

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,840
so we've got a simple rain gauge which

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,490
operates with a little C saw that little

00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,990
seesaw triggers it or tiny little

00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:52,450
digital switch so it just counts the

00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:54,430
number of tips okay so we've got the

00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:59,080
rain gauge so we can detect amount of

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,690
rainfall we've got these two sensors so

00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,700
this one is an anemometer so we can

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:05,560
measure wind speed and this one is a

00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,220
weather vane so we can measure wind

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,070
direction

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,340
okay and these just connect via a very

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,660
simple cable

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,090
thank you okay

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,680
and so you got all these different

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,239
sensors we've also got on the air

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,479
quality sensor we've got a ground

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,530
temperature probe that we can bury in

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,830
the ground so we can measure the

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:29,110
temperature of the soil

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,830
and we've got whole other centers we've

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:33,819
got there so we've also got to because

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:36,520
part of this is it's gonna be doing data

00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:37,949
logging so we've also got a backup

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,120
battery on there for the real-time clock

00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,729
so this board sits on the Raspberry Pi

00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:45,250
and you deploy it somewhere and it sits

00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:48,099
there and it does data logging okay now

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:50,259
you can when you get when these are out

00:04:48,099 --> 00:04:52,180
there and available you can just follow

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,639
a guide set it up deploy it and have it

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,930
just logging data and that's that's a

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,669
great big tip you know you've got a

00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,919
lovely weather station set up kids can

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:01,860
interrogate data but what's even better

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,229
is if you can show the kids how it works

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:07,990
so I'll come back to the project let's

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:09,759
talk about resources so what we're doing

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:12,189
is we're building up a selection of

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,409
resources which are going to show kids

00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:17,020
how to go through building their own

00:05:14,409 --> 00:05:19,840
weather station from scratch and to the

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,729
first one reading digital sensors that's

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,360
fairly straightforward if you've got a

00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:28,990
rain gauge and that's tipping you can

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,240
detect the number of pulses that that

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,099
sends down that wire ok the simple tick

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,659
if you know how much water is in each

00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,159
bucket that causes it to tip you can

00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:38,259
then work out how much water has flown

00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:40,719
through that so the simple bit of maths

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:43,060
in there to work that out the anemometer

00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:45,339
is similar inside the anemometer there's

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:47,800
a little magnet and as the anemometer

00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:49,900
spins around that magnet creates a

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:52,330
little tick okay and then you have to do

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,490
some maths so we're adding some math

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,719
since those and schemes of work where

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,029
the students have to work out the

00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:00,610
circumference prescribed by the

00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:02,050
anemometer they can use that to work out

00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,370
the distance traveled in a certain

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,560
amount of times they can work out the

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,240
wind speed they even because the guy

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,219
that sort of has written some other

00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,419
stuff this is very thorough you even I

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:12,490
think adjust for what's called

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:17,889
anemometer factor the energy lost by the

00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:19,089
wind pushing the and we've got a series

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:20,710
of other schemes of work that we're

00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:22,960
serving the point line as well so the

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:24,370
analog data bit is a bit harder but

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,469
we're hoping to get kids actually

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,930
reading some of the analog sensors as

00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,580
well presenting live data and if the

00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,529
live demo works later on we've got a

00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,199
really simple PI game GUI that we just

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:36,550
knocked up for a demonstration but

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,320
actually so that you could see what

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:41,380
those sensors are reading right

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,910
now and then talking about how to do

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,340
data logging okay so now we've got our

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,270
sensors collecting all this information

00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,100
how we're going to log for now we're

00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,540
going to use text files well there's

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:53,350
lots of inherent issues with that are we

00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,280
gonna use you know and ultimately we'll

00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,650
get run to the idea that we use a

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,870
database we'll show them how to do that

00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:01,020
we'll show them how to build a web sort

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:05,080
of interface so you can see graphing of

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,000
this data and then the big data icon

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,220
will jump around a little bit on this

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,480
and the big data bit is that we're going

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,370
to be collecting data from all around

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,950
the globe and local data is going to be

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,210
available to schools so not only can

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,740
they access the data from their local

00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,480
weather station but they can access the

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:21,370
data from weather stations all around

00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,710
the globe collected by school children

00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:26,410
like them bringing them into a truly

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:29,500
global project so how we're going to do

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,460
this so the project is is bigger than

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,580
the hardware it's bigger than the

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,690
resources it's a huge project so we're

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,000
going to produce a thousand of these

00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,800
kits and already they're like we're

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,270
totally oversubscribed you know loads of

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,010
schools have signed up but they're gonna

00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,870
be going to schools the first thousand

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:45,550
and they're going globally and that's

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:47,530
partly with Oracle and in Oracle are

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,180
involved in other aspects later on as

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,340
well so we're going to produce these

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,590
resources which we're going to share

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:56,650
with people with schools so that you can

00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,480
use them and the local school is going

00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:59,980
to log their data in my sequel database

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,990
which is learning to be periodically

00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,130
uploaded to a central Oracle database

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:05,380
which is going to be able to be

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,510
accessible to all the schools

00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,650
participating and I think possibly

00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,970
beyond so I've been involved my my role

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,620
in this apart from delivering it in

00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,140
school my role has been mainly on the

00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:20,560
resources so to give you a little flavor

00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,540
of the resources so this is if you've

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,690
not been to raspberry pie this is our

00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,510
what our resources are look like this is

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,700
not yet on the public site but will be

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:32,860
shortly so we've got a little overview

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,890
here of the resource it tells you what

00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:38,560
you will need now very quickly if we

00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,669
intimate connections gone great and so

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,020
I'll just talk about them so that's data

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,479
service to format I very quickly

00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:46,270
realized bringing this into school that

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,090
I had one weather station and a class of

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,680
twenty kids and getting them all to

00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,700
engage with this one weather station was

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,640
gonna be difficult

00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,470
so there's some problems there now the

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,260
first thing you can really easily do for

00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,730
the first scheme of work in here if my

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,030
interconnection was to come back

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,890
I'd better go into the what you need and

00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:07,390
you can simulate an anemometer you don't

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,770
need no you don't even need all the

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,000
fancy board the fancy board there's lots

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,520
of other cool stuff later on and you

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,030
will need those bits but see my

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,370
anemometer all that is I think spinning

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,320
around is a switch so you could use a

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,290
pair of wires just two wires and just

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,750
tap them together or a button hooked up

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,280
to the PI and the kids can then wear a

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,780
competition to see how fast they could

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,210
stimulate wind which is quite an odd

00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:32,680
sight is mashing buttons trying to I get

00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:35,770
the fastest wind speed who can make it

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,420
rain faster yeah and then and then we

00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,950
like once their code was working they

00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,750
could come up and bring their PI hook it

00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:42,970
up to the weather station test it and

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:44,800
then we had water on the teacher's desk

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,300
and that was that was dangerous but we

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,610
know we tested it we do some calibration

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,160
so there's loads of cool math and

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:55,960
science and programming involved in this

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,130
and so that's sort of all what we wanted

00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,830
to talk about about the weather station

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:02,320
kit itself so what I think I'm going to

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,320
do now is I'm going to try and do a live

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,840
demo which could be interesting

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,490
so what we shall see so what I'm gonna

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,110
do is well maybe if it's okay

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,490
is I might at this stage whilst I'm

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,440
doing some setting up open the floor to

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,300
any questions that you might have if

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,920
that's okay and then I can be answering

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:19,240
those whilst I'm also setting up so I'm

00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,990
going to give that a go is that alright

00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,690
cool so do we have any questions at all

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,330
about the weather station always gonna

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,130
be setting up in silence all right

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:32,130
awesome thinking right

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:44,500
I guess one of the obvious questions is

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:48,790
is what is your ETA for so much of this

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:51,150
additional kit right so the thousand

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,500
boards that we're producing they are

00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,420
they are almost produced I think as far

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,620
as I'm aware so the the project

00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,330
currently I'm involved in the resource

00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,750
generation and sort of the project

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:06,130
that's my primary focus but I'm also

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:08,020
working on but I'm also working more

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,580
generally with the project and I'm aware

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,100
of the conversations now I think our aim

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,060
is to get these into schools sort of

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:17,200
early to late autumn this year

00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:20,050
but we're still waiting to have some of

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,620
these resources written and working and

00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:25,510
then beyond that I believe again this

00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:27,040
isn't sort of in concrete but I believe

00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,450
the idea is that these boards will

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,700
eventually go on sale so that other

00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,250
people can purchase them have those in

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,720
their school and just before I left the

00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,100
guy who designed the hardware we're

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,770
saying that it's had some interest from

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,460
some third parties some people there's a

00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:44,460
group called nature bytes who do like

00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:46,840
bird boxes with cameras and things and

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:49,660
what they want to do is they want to

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,420
integrate the weather station into their

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,670
product so that as well as collecting

00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:57,730
data about the wildlife they're also

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,140
collecting data about the weather and

00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:00,760
the conditions and the climate at the

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,960
same time so you've got that sort of a

00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,790
map of what's happening with the

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,440
wildlife and what's going on in a local

00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,890
environment does that answer the

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,510
question

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:12,130
in terms of timescales roughly or yeah

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:14,140
we're sort of roughly I think I think

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,000
six months would be a fair estimate at

00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,770
the moment asteroid pie which I

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,260
mentioned at the beginning which is our

00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,520
space project that's taking up a huge

00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,750
amount of our time and we've got a very

00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,580
fixed deadline which is a launch a

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,110
rocket launch which we have to kind of

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,310
fit in with you know they're not going

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:36,070
to wait for us we asked but ISA that

00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:37,240
they're not overly flexible on moving as

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,090
thoughts of their Soyuz rocket for a

00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,800
tubular two kilogram payload so and so

00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,930
yeah it's we kind of we're a small team

00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,080
so the team that we've got with us today

00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:49,620
myself Kerry and Ben

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,339
that's pretty maybe half a team yeah

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,290
that's it

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,700
and we're the ones writing the resources

00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,800
we're out doing conferences like this

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,690
we're a very small team so bear with us

00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:05,820
but I think six months would probably be

00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:10,079
a fair estimate yeah so you've got a

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,970
strop I and the weather station are you

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,510
allowed to tell us what are the magic

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,920
profits in the pipeline if we knew I

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,240
would probably I'll tell you but and

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,500
it's so there are a number of things

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,060
going on so I mentioned I'm forty tarski

00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,550
I'm very sorry I should have done maybe

00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:32,190
not done this yeah Nick's pressing me

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,390
for to give something away no and so

00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,160
things we currently doing at the moment

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,420
so the the picture the space launch

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,220
picture that I showed you earlier on the

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,410
balloon we did last week we are working

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,230
with some teachers later this month to

00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,420
get them trained up on how to launch

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:50,700
their own weather balloon launch with a

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:53,220
PI attached so that they can so that

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,529
they can take this there as we fly into

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,270
space and interrogate and capture data

00:13:55,529 --> 00:13:59,100
from up there so we had this really

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:06,240
successful launch this week I'm running

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:08,250
out of space up here sorry I'm probably

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,110
okay I think I'm just gonna try and get

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,779
this wire to reach this laptop and that

00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:17,130
I'm good and so yeah we did this launch

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,360
with in in Cambridge we had a little

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,720
test launch and then later in the month

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,079
we've got four so 24 teachers coming to

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,220
visit us there we are good Twitter

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,010
visitors and we're going to teach them

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:30,899
how to launch their own balloons and at

00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,250
the moment bit of a challenge to you and

00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:34,709
something we're going to take hopefully

00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:37,110
take to Pyke on UK this balloon launch

00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:40,290
is currently the software that runs the

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:42,360
tracker is all written in C so when I

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,680
sat down and try to get my kids to do

00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,589
some pre programming of it and

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,029
manipulate how it's working I'm not

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:49,529
going to touch that bit because that's C

00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,110
and I'm you know I can do some piping

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:53,370
but yeah yeah it's horrible so we just

00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:54,449
stuck to doing all the science and the

00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,420
math and the engineering in the

00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:59,040
prediction and what would be awesome

00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,880
from a teaching point of view is if I

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,500
could actually

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,180
the kids - the code that's working

00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,680
behind there and have some top-level

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,720
libraries that just said right here's

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,550
the basin here's the functionality these

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
parameters you can change his ways you

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,220
can manipulate it so if you're

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,540
interested in getting involved in that

00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:15,000
project I know the guy who wrote the

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,380
original software it's mainly time for

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,759
him he's learnt a bit of Python but he

00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,009
just hasn't got the time to go and

00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,329
implement that so and if you're

00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:25,050
interested see me off as an Alf and I'll

00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:27,029
try to have a chance so now we've got

00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,829
here so if we just go in and open up a

00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:30,630
little terminal window so this is just a

00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:32,750
Raspberry Pi it took a few minutes to

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:36,959
load up because it's using the B+

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:39,149
because we don't need the power of the

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,000
PI - it's just sitting there logging ok

00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:43,800
and Dave went for some who wrote this

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:51,350
when it was a really super original

00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:55,500
naming so it's just called I think Dave

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:57,180
obviously so hopefully we should what we

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,319
should get here is a lovely play game

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,690
interface and we can see the local

00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:04,800
current weather conditions now I believe

00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,389
there's a setting which I may have had

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,279
to disable but we'll give it a go so the

00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,110
idea here is we've got this I'm going on

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:13,560
I think because it's data logging in the

00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,329
background yeah I have to turn something

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,589
off give me a second

00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:21,300
so what I have to do is there's a chrome

00:16:19,589 --> 00:16:32,699
job running in the background that I

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:35,220
think I have to close that and and even

00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:38,130
if I get the live data working you know

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,420
you get your idea you know the bit I

00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,600
would struggle with we're taking this

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:44,339
into the classroom is ok that's not

00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,459
quite working at the moment I've I've

00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:50,009
never written PI game software ok or

00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,870
play game applications and Dave threw

00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,819
this together in a few hours but

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,800
approaching that with kids that would be

00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:57,269
quite a challenging thing so what you

00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,920
know I would really like from you know

00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:01,259
if anyone's interested in helping you is

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,910
a nice sort of framework GUI where

00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:04,770
you've got the basic elements and the

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,419
kids just looking manipulate properties

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,490
they haven't got to start that GUI from

00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:10,140
from scratch and perhaps of this

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,130
implemented in Play game 0 which we

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,709
heard about this morning would be

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:15,449
awesome I would just if I could show you

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:20,029
one other bit that we've got working so

00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:22,169
this has been sitting data logging and

00:17:20,029 --> 00:17:23,220
instead of creating a little database in

00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,980
the background it's been running for

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,779
about day there's not much data there

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:32,010
but what we've got on there if it's

00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:34,880
still running we've got a website that's

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,600
doing some graphing and I was recently

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,919
really interesting I was recently

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,039
looking back I've still got remote

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:48,120
access to my one bucket school and I

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:49,740
recently logged into it too I logged

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,539
into it to have a look at what it was

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,350
doing it was really interesting up until

00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:57,059
a few days ago there was about three

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,909
o'clock there was a noticeable dip in

00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,770
air quality and I've took in a while

00:17:59,909 --> 00:18:03,090
every day there's a noticeable dip apart

00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:04,559
from weekends was a notable dip around

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,840
three o'clock was a dip in air quality

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,179
and I realized that it was because it

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,700
was on the classroom wall directly next

00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,899
to the carpark and so at 3 o'clock when

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:15,480
other teachers just were like right on

00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:17,970
off got in their cars all their exhaust

00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,919
fumes just kind of like just like caught

00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:24,029
by the Airways Center and every day it

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,070
was this spike in air quality so just

00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:27,179
bear with me I think it's demo and then

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,860
if it's still really in the background

00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:31,830
we should get yep look a little

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:35,159
raspberry weather demo so I think we

00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:36,929
should have brilliant and we should have

00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:38,549
a lot of graphs there which I'm working

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,399
but the idea is it will work through

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:43,440
with kids and show them how to put graph

00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:45,360
data on there so they can they can plot

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,080
the sort of their findings from the last

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,580
few days ok it's a partially successful

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,370
demo at least it booted and showed on

00:18:50,580 --> 00:19:03,330
there yes so any any other questions

00:18:53,370 --> 00:19:07,020
because I've got I I was wondering about

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:10,549
the screen plant monitoring project I

00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:17,820
was reading a little bit about it and I

00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:20,820
think setting up to complex but the

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,670
green house looks good but I think it's

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:26,100
there's been some projects in the UK

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:28,830
testing it and then can you share any

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,780
timeframe or it's too early or with

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:36,090
which projects are they I said they the

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,980
plant monitoring it's a small scale

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:40,200
project which is happening so how many

00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,060
of those boards have we produced is it's

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,320
a small little sample for its at the

00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,200
moment though those those those

00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:50,280
greenhouses are in an exhibit so it's

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,720
part of an art so yeah so we've got

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,060
about a hundred that we've produced for

00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,450
this this art exhibit project going on

00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:00,360
and the creator of those is mainly

00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:03,210
looking at the moment at how she can

00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,420
engage adults and children together on

00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,030
the same project so and the teachers so

00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,140
the outs and children have come together

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:11,610
to the workshop they've learned how to

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,440
use they're taken at home and their work

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,140
now working together on it and then

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,440
lessons learnt from that that may some

00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,580
point down the line inform some some of

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,840
the schemes of work or that kind of

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,050
thing that's probably a bit further down

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,050
the line

00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:48,240
I think this this weather station

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:52,490
project may be a little bit complex for

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:56,460
children but what age do you think a

00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:59,760
child could be happily involved in this

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,920
kind of project okay so the so he saw

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,590
ago I had the different schemes of work

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,820
and that we're sort of proposing and the

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,470
first scheme of work that I've written

00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:12,900
I've used that with Key Stage three

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:15,930
children so in the UK that is 11 to 14

00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,700
years old okay and they've done some

00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:21,930
very basic Python I mean they're Python

00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,900
programs consist of twelve lines of

00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:26,820
Python because all they're doing is

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,190
they're importing some stuff they are

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,890
setting up some pins and they just sit

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:33,600
there and count in a loop how many how

00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,520
many events there are and then they're

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,340
just every few seconds they just present

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:41,520
what the current wind speed is so that's

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,530
certainly very accessible the the

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,030
graphical user interface side of things

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,410
I think that's probably where we're

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,230
looking at upper secondary there so

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,150
sixteen onwards but we're also we're

00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,280
we've got another idea which we've

00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,240
proposed and so there was a talk earlier

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:58,170
on we would talk about physical

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,300
computing it's in theory possible to

00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:03,600
interact with this weather station using

00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,610
other languages such as scratch so and

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,980
one idea that we've currently got is to

00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,170
develop maybe a way of displaying some

00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,360
weather data using scratch so for your

00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,950
young children they could be reading

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,060
some of that data and displaying it in a

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,410
more graphical kind of engaging way and

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,880
even we know with really young children

00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,130
they could just have you know it is

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,390
raining therefore I'm gonna have like a

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,540
rain cloud appear you know you could do

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,770
some really simple stuff but also as

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,630
well once you've got all this data

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,150
that's been collected that might be the

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:34,680
point at which the primary schools can

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:36,540
get involved because you've got this

00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:38,970
data we can start talking about what is

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:40,830
weather how do we log it what does it

00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:44,150
mean how do we predict and they can

00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,150
