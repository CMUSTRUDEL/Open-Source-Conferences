[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]

The Raspberry Pi weather station project introduces young people to
using python programming to  solve real and technical problems. The
weather station consists of a range of sensors including:
Anemometer
Rain gauge
Wind Vane
Temperature Probe
Barometer
Air Quality Sensor
Hygrometer

1000 kits are being given away to schools to take part in the project
by following our schemes of work which will involve.
Programming basic interrupt based sensors
Advanced Sensors using ADC chips
Create a pygame based UI
Logging data to MySQL and Oracle Apex
Presenting data to a web app
Deploying the weather station
Integrating Apex database

We would love feedback on the project from Python Developers and
support in updating some libraries from python 2 to 3.
