Continuous Integration is a software development practice where
members of a team integrate their work frequently, leading to multiple
integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated
process (including tests) to detect integration errors as quickly as
possible.

This talk will introduce the basic principles for building an
effective Continuous Integration system for Python-based projects. It
will present the lessons learned from building a Jenkins-based CI
system for an Open Source project with a distributed team of more than
340 core developers that ranks  among the top 2% of all open source
projects worldwide (Plone).
