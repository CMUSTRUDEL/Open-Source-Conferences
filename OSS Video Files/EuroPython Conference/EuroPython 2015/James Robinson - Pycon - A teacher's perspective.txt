Description: 
	James Robinson - Pycon - A teacher's perspective
[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]

A perspective of the impact of the PyconUK education track from the
point of view of teachers and educators.

Having attended the education track at Pycon UK 2014 as a teacher, my
talk will share both my experiences and those of other teachers
attending. The  education track bought educators and developers
together in a way that allowed the teachers to get support and advice
whilst developers   get to support teachers in developing exciting &
real applications for teaching computing.

The talk will focus on two aspects of the education track. The
workshops delivered for teachers by python developers and how this
helps build teachers confidence.  But also the breakout sessions where
educators and developers with common interests can work together to
develop something. This might be a program / library or a teaching
resource, some developers gave a hands on and bespoke training session
to a group of teachers.

If we are to get more young people programming or at least having  a
positive experience of programming then we need to minimize obstacles
to that experience. By having educators and developers working
together we can identify those obstacles and eliminate them!

James I'm an ex-teacher I now work for

00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:06,839
the raspberry pi foundation and I want

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,030
to talk to you a little bit today about

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,030
Python UK and in particular the

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,820
education track that I attended last

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,529
year just before I get started I'm just

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,720
imagining that the majority of the

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,369
audience are developers at the case or

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,320
any teachers or educators in the room

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,109
awesome so we've got some we've got some

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,289
educators awesome so I'm a little bit

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,630
about Python UK and and to do that I'm

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,059
going to just step back a little bit i

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,800
will be reemphasize in a few points that

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,040
carry on made in her keynote this

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,230
morning and but I want to just step back

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,379
to how I began as a learner so sometime

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:49,829
in the 80s and we'll keep up fake and ie

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,610
was embarking upon my early education

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,980
and and my my mum but it was very good

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,570
at supporting me with just exploring the

00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,430
world and finding out things and she'd

00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:01,980
often come home and I have a theory that

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,510
fall about how gravity worked it was

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,640
wrong should should come I'm not greet

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:09,630
her with theory but i was i was as kids

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,640
are i was keen to investigate I like

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,890
playing with things and so the things

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,580
that informed my early education with

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:19,380
things like Lego which I played with for

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:21,630
hours on end followed the manuals I

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,520
don't think i heard that set i think i

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,400
coveted that set i think i had the

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,049
smaller version and about the age of

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,610
eight I think we got our first family

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,579
computer we've got the cheaper version

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,430
of a Commodore 64 this is the Atari 65

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,920
XE technically it was a family computer

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,750
but my siblings knew that really it was

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,630
mine and I made a very abundantly clear

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:45,090
and I began after playing some games i

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,360
started i'm using basic and writing some

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,909
very simple programs and I was also

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,360
really into craft anything you know glue

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:56,009
scissors cardboard I'd make anything and

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,469
I'll come back to this idea in just a

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:00,540
second but and also progressed from

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,670
basic leg of my progress to Technic a

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,259
technique I loved and still love you

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,850
know I got I got Technic this year for

00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,399
my birthday and that was the best

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,289
present that I got it was awesome we've

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,330
recently our house has been packed up as

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,080
is we're doing an extension my lego came

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,590
out and I was a

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,350
well yeah there's my crane thing but for

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,540
me the point with Lego was I didn't just

00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,420
learn about how to connect things it

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,700
taught me about mechanical systems the

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:29,100
first kid I got had a differential gear

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,470
and this is amazing now I understand how

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,810
a car works brilliant and so I learned

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:37,280
so many things from these again that's

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:41,130
set i coveted and bought when I was 25

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,720
so Lego really informed my name is well

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,670
knitting was something that my mom

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,550
taught me quite early on i lost the

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,990
skill and have recently almost picked it

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,720
back up again i was on a recent trip and

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,060
I took some knitting with me and and I

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,860
as well as starting at with some basic

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,690
programming I I picked up some of the

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,530
Osborn books which were fantastic and I

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:03,390
specifically remember this book and

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,310
battleship style game that I built and

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,170
the point I want to make about these

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,860
education experiences these were you

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:13,260
know before school law or sort of on top

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,290
of the Stefan's doing at school is that

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,930
all of them were playful all of them I

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,489
proked in a playful manner okay and

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,290
every single one of them I could put

00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,900
down at any moment I could make

00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:27,570
something in Lego and go like that I'll

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,100
throw it away okay and this kind of

00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:30,930
comes back when we were talking my IDs

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,959
during the keynote and one of the things

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,970
that I really wanted to bring up at that

00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:37,230
point was that when you've got to use an

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,120
ID and you're going to make a project

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:41,070
you're kind of you're committing to

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,660
making a project whereas if you've got

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,120
this nice sort of boilerplate scratchpad

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,060
style area you're playing you can play

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,200
as kids do and then just chuck it away

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,580
okay the other thing about these

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,160
learning experiences was there was

00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:54,750
purpose there was something that only

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,180
wanted to get out something that meant

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:59,040
something to me it wasn't someone

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,290
telling me to do something I wanted to

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,390
build that Airport I wanted to knit

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,070
something I wanted to build the Technic

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:07,650
thing and I wanted my game to work and

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:10,010
was frustrated when it didn't and the

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,420
final thing was was it was progression

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,850
there was always somewhere for me to go

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,070
next so I started out with print hello

00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,989
world my exhausted all the examples in

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:21,630
the Atari manual that came with it but

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:23,700
then I found somewhere else to go Lego

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:25,020
there's just so many places you can take

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,820
that and there's so many crafts out

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,640
there there's always somewhere new to go

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,740
so those three things playfulness

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,570
progression and purpose something I

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,660
think is really important in educational

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,340
experiences and and there's a middle

00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,440
section to my life where I went to

00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,940
university did computer science lots of

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,490
interesting anecdotes involving me

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,610
mainly losing stuff that doesn't happen

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:48,900
anymore I'm a reformed here and then

00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,910
this wisdom this was me as an educator

00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:54,360
so I've moved on from being alone and in

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:56,270
2004 I started a career in teaching so i

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,040
started my time as a math teacher and

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,810
ask someone who could use a computer and

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,020
there's an outgoing head of ICT picked

00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,720
up this roll and and really enjoyed

00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,030
doing it it was a great experience but I

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,860
did get quite quickly frustrated with

00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,060
ICT and this again echo some other

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,630
points that carrie Ann was making

00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:18,360
earlier a lot of ICT was being driven by

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,600
office app based programming was limited

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,550
to excel macros and formula and a lot of

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,130
the engaging and difficult also what I

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,840
would decide to describe as engaging and

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,480
what a lot of teachers might consider

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,490
difficult concepts or activities were

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,020
left to the end of the year a lot of

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,460
primary school teachers that I was sort

00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,770
of talking to around the time was oh

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:40,380
yeah would you lego robotics and we

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,780
program them in like the summer term

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,370
sometimes we don't get the full six

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,320
weeks we a lot of sometimes we do a week

00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,120
because it was those things they'd leave

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,980
to the end as the fun activity to end

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,930
the year and then at the end of the year

00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:54,360
I fell off the end of the year never

00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,890
mind we'll do it next year and those

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,660
kind of experiences were always being

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:02,430
left to the end so as I started I I was

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,780
sort of kind of really trying to change

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,400
the way that I was doing things in

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,230
school I'm an experienced the school to

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,080
buy some Lego robotics we started a lego

00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:11,850
club we entered the first lego league

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,430
games factory as I will never used games

00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:16,470
factory it doesn't really exist anymore

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,360
but that's where I started and iram

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,890
banging out in a shop in my local town

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,110
called micro future where they had this

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,940
system called click and play and it was

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,500
a drag-and-drop game's engine you put a

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,420
spriting you press the button and it

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,400
pinged around and bounced off walls and

00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,590
that was your starting point and they

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,420
they developed into an intern education

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,330
product and I use that in school it was

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,220
really good and scratch again lots of

00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:40,110
scratched of simulating games those kind

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,450
of things and we also

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,770
some HTML there wasn't HTML before sorry

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:47,630
I keep turning and the microphone keeps

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,800
accusing me on a visitor and so HTML was

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,930
was something that the school had

00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,390
previously done through like front page

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,430
or dreamweaver or something like that I

00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,620
think you start using those big heavy

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,600
ideas and you start losing the basics of

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,520
how that works it's not how I learn HTML

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,860
I learned hateful with a notepad in one

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,930
window eyebrows in another window stave

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,890
refresh save refresh that you've refresh

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,840
so we did some basic HTML stuff and then

00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,030
I moved on I went to a secondary school

00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,980
but I began collaborating and this is

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,900
the point where I think things changed a

00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,080
lot for me because those frustrations

00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:25,220
that I had in school being the only

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,200
teacher who kind of in my mind got it

00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:30,060
was really difficult so starting to

00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,130
connect with other teachers was really

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,140
important i joined cans which is a group

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,300
in the UK called computing of schools i

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:38,040
started working with local primaries

00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:43,170
helping them deliver robotics in their

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:44,880
schools and then all of a sudden um it

00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:46,920
was it was a few years ago and it was

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,350
possible to teach the GCSE in computer

00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,120
science so there's a pilot phase and

00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,070
there was a phase where teachers could

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,360
pick it up and I was super excited by

00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,800
this because this is finally you know

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,870
all these things either by all about

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,000
we're going to happen I like to pick

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,770
this up and I was really excited and

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,170
then I suddenly realized why sure how am

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:06,210
I going to deliver this what what's my

00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,250
route to deliver this with kids and the

00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:09,600
first question was what language and

00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,430
that sort of again like we mentioned

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,800
earlier on in the keynote this took me

00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,990
back to my my childhood experiences

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,930
using basic and Python was really the

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,120
clear choice for me and others hold so

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,850
how I teach this how do I go about

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,460
sharing this with kids and I know how to

00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,530
write a loop or lighter function or do

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,900
this and that but to me it seems

00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,570
self-evident how do I break that down

00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,310
and take my understanding and put it get

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:39,810
it across to the case and how do I

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:42,240
challenged kids I had a kid in my first

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,900
GCSE class who've been programming since

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,190
the age of five and had never stopped

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,900
unlike me but when when I was a kid we

00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,970
didn't have the internet we were very

00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:52,830
late getting the internet eventually I

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,470
convinced my dad to buy a three month

00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,140
trial

00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,210
this internet thing we got on there and

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,250
suddenly you know my horizons were

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,340
expanded but he'd been learning python

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:05,950
for years and see in Java and he was at

00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,660
that time he came to my classroom he was

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:10,030
a far better programmer that I think I

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:11,440
will ever be so how do I challenged kids

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:13,960
like that that have this experience

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,680
because there is unlike traditional

00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:19,960
subjects there is this this difference

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,280
of experience some kids would have been

00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,020
doing this for years and years and years

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,480
and have a wealth of experience it will

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,130
just click and other kids might be aware

00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,710
of it what I've been put off by it in

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,870
the past so where is another subject you

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,240
might have a fairly level playing field

00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:39,670
you've got a whole different range of

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:41,170
experiences so and the collaboration

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,820
with other teachers was imperative was

00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,610
really important and it was around that

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,790
time that i gave a talk at a raspberry

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:51,820
jam I met carry on shortly afterwards

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,760
went to pry academy joined Twitter went

00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,930
to Morehouse conferences and things and

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,770
that was the point at which i gotta i

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,150
would became aware of pike on UK and

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,470
richard my application hurriedly because

00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,440
there was a deadline and if you quit the

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,450
quick you'll get a free place and

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,250
they'll fund your cover costs so great

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:13,180
yeah I'll do that and so that's how I

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:15,130
got to hike on UK so parkland UK was a

00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:18,670
fantastic experience for me it was the

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,260
last September and particularly the

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,810
education track which is where I spent

00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,760
my day unfortunately I had just moved

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,050
house and so I had a wall to go knock

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:29,020
down or something at home so I could

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:30,820
only stay for the Friday but there was a

00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,680
two-day Trek the first day the teachers

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,110
day was was brilliant and i'll talk more

00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,490
about how these worked in a moment the

00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,470
second day was a kid's day and

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,090
developers were welcome to come to both

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,830
of those two days and courage to come to

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:43,420
both of those two days it's act as a

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,740
picture somewhere of Nick in a minute I

00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,350
think if the first picture I've gotten

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:51,160
here yeah saying go to the education

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,140
track you should be there and so it was

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,990
fantastic it was filled with workshops

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:59,530
demos training discussions quadcopters

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,870
towards the end of the day and cake with

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,640
you know which is going to get anyone

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,540
there really and I out the cakes here

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,850
they don't wet your appetite nothing

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:12,139
amazing and we were joined by members of

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:13,759
the Occupy team so dave is in the bottom

00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:15,529
right hand corner he's not with us today

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,360
he's the guy that Ben was previously

00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:19,130
talking about who he's doing loads of

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,750
space stuff we've got then we've got

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,449
carry on and we've got Alex he's down

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,819
here with us as well and there's the

00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:28,220
cake yeah so the cake was amazing so one

00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:30,920
of our a teacher that I hadn't met at

00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,990
this point but I was aware of from

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,800
Twitter called cat she'd been on a

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:38,269
following Pike Adam II after me and we

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,680
would have been chatting a little bit on

00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,440
Twitter and she was like I'm gonna bring

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,630
cake so she turned up with this cake it

00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,889
just vanished I think I saw it in the

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,970
begin of the day and then body like

00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,319
halfway through that I was like where's

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,839
that cake done and there was always one

00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:52,940
cake left so it was it was a fantastic

00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:55,009
day oh the the link at the bottom I've

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,990
nicked a few things from Nick tolerates

00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:59,269
excellent introduction to python UK if

00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,100
you want to have a more detailed

00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:03,310
overview of the two days you can follow

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,630
that link and that will take you there

00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,779
and we were also joined by members of

00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:09,529
the community I forgot to thank two

00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,010
people at the beginning of the

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:16,279
presentation this is alan Tamaki who is

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:17,779
always Nick provided some last-minute a

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:19,790
lot of the images that I've used in this

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,670
presentation because I had some camera

00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,139
failure issues so and yes a loads loads

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:25,880
of community people that had given up

00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:29,480
their time to come along to talk about

00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,800
education how we educate and the owners

00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,010
of the projects that we should be

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,920
focusing on so this was sort of how the

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,329
teachers day was broken down so first of

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,829
all we can see we've had a session a

00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:43,399
minecraft pie and we can see all the

00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:46,490
teachers worshiping minecraft there or

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:47,870
Martin I'm not entirely sure mmm so this

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,189
guy you can see feeling at the front

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,310
there this is Martin here's a good an

00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:54,110
excellent website stuff about code and

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,959
thats that's how I usually starts his

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:58,310
workshop with a ok please you know pay

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,839
your respect worship that kind of thing

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,089
so and he gave everyone a little

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,199
demonstration of how to use Python

00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:08,420
library to interface with Minecraft and

00:13:05,199 --> 00:13:10,189
create amazing things and if you think

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,880
back to that the first point I made

00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:15,260
about my early experiences with Lego and

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,649
minecraft is often described as digital

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,329
Lego ok this playground this this

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:21,980
where kids can play I don't see

00:13:20,329 --> 00:13:24,199
minecraft when we talk to teachers I

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,720
don't try and put Minecraft across as

00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:29,209
always a game Minecraft for me in

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,279
education is a medium it's a way of

00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,959
expressing things the idea we talked

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:36,709
about earlier on the story about all we

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:38,269
want a game where we've got you know set

00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,670
on a planet and there's aliens and you

00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,589
shoot them well with things like 2d

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,629
graphics pygame to get kids to make

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,369
something graphical I never bothered

00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:48,319
with my GCSE kids because it was just

00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:50,899
was D that it was more than a level

00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:52,910
topic anyway but for the amount of time

00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:55,100
i had to put in to get something simple

00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:56,720
graphical on the screen it just you know

00:13:55,100 --> 00:14:00,259
pi games wasn't worth playing with at

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,660
that time minecraft we can build all

00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:04,459
sorts of things with minecraft so we set

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:06,980
my kids in school the challenge we said

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,089
go away and only to build space invader

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,740
and they went to when they did that they

00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,720
built space invaders but then they turn

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,189
those into flashing space invaders gate

00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,389
space invaders that chased you spay

00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:16,459
somebody doesn't drop things on your

00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:18,290
head space invaders that chased you they

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,720
hid space invaders around the world and

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:22,160
it'll go and find them so minecraft is a

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,129
medium and this this workshop was

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,600
fantastic though loads of people it was

00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:29,089
a first experience of minecraft first

00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,660
experience of programming and they loved

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:34,939
that we then there's a session we had

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,679
all about physical computing so some of

00:14:34,939 --> 00:14:38,949
the things that ben's just been talking

00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:42,199
about in his talk there was a session

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:43,939
flashing LEDs using motors with some

00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:46,249
spinning flowers and bees is that right

00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:47,749
yeah okay I wasn't in that session there

00:14:46,249 --> 00:14:51,350
was a bit of a split at that point and

00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:54,170
but there was some physical computing we

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,629
also had a session with an introduction

00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:59,209
for secondary teachers particularly to

00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:00,889
object orientation for lots of those

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,420
teachers object orientation with

00:15:00,889 --> 00:15:06,410
something they might encounter with

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,639
libraries that they're using but wasn't

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,139
something they were overly familiar with

00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,929
it wasn't something that they had used

00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:15,079
for ever or for a long time so it's a

00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:17,569
great introduction or refresher we also

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,970
we had a team brought over simple it's

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:22,249
gone too far okay there's a robot there

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,259
it's gonna disappear and so the robot

00:15:22,249 --> 00:15:26,720
there it's got a now robot and a team

00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:29,059
brought those over they dance they sang

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,499
they did all kinds of clever things you

00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:32,030
could take them for walks and they

00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:33,560
talked about their programming interface

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:35,990
behind that and how school should be

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,450
doing more robotics and then the

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,550
afternoon session we had an unconference

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,750
style session so we started off with all

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:44,210
the teachers and developers together

00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,250
we've pitched some ideas and then we all

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,900
broke off into groups and we kind of

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,080
worked together as teachers and

00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,000
developers to either do some resource

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,800
development so I want a resource that

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,900
helps me teach this concept let's go and

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,430
make it together brilliant or perhaps

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:03,170
some coaching so there was a lady who

00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,270
wanted some help with I think she was

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,210
into web stuff and she wanted some help

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,460
with Django I thought the rings of eight

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,530
bell and so she sat down with a

00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,050
developer who helped understand how

00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:16,430
Django works and right the beginning or

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,030
the framework for a scheme of work to

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:20,990
take back with her kids and there was a

00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:22,430
people that were sort of talking about

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,090
how to make some libraries or some tools

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:28,280
so this this screen here and there's a

00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,930
thing for one of the GCSEs they have to

00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,080
do a project on a little man computer

00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,640
you guys aware of little man computer

00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,320
okay it's kind of I don't teach that

00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:39,080
spec partly cuz I don't want the c'mon

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:43,420
computer but i think it's basically it's

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:46,490
a simulator to help you teach kids

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,890
machine code type like the very low

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:50,300
level code stuff sober a basic

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,530
operations and instructions and the

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,730
complaint from one of the teachers was

00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,470
at the moment this doesn't run on the

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:55,760
Raspberry Pi and we're using them so

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:57,890
they sat down with some developers and

00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,360
they ported it to the Raspberry Pi okay

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:02,090
and that was like an afternoon's work

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,650
for a developer so this this bit the

00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,120
second part of the day was really really

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,730
valuable because it get they gather

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:11,600
teachers the chance to direct that help

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,190
the support they needed I think this

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,720
collaboration is really important so if

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,970
we think about the first group of people

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,850
that are there the teachers okay the

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:22,040
teachers they're really great delivery

00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,150
okay they've bought years of experience

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,850
of doing that they know how to take a

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,530
concept to break it down into parts to

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,440
work out how to deliver that to explain

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,030
that to get that idea across they're

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,590
also great at that sort of idea of

00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,450
progression so this is your starting

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:37,190
point we want to teach you this concept

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,370
what's the pathway that we're going to

00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,740
take to get there the greater assessing

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,880
knowing where kids are up to it kept

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,350
your sort of getting a really good

00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,230
measure of what kids

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:51,320
stand what they haven't grasped and what

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:53,090
their next steps are and also good

00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:55,970
engaging pupils you know it's their job

00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:57,620
is part of what they do but well they

00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,809
need help with and this is going back to

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,150
my experience as a classroom teacher

00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:05,179
what we often need help with is our

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:06,770
background knowledge okay I I programmed

00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,450
as a kid I did bits as I was growing up

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,549
I did a computer science degree where I

00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,190
did bits of Java but it was more systems

00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:15,830
kind of base I haven't done programming

00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:17,419
you know for a long time and so my

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:19,190
knowledge is rusty so having that

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:22,070
support and some people that don't have

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:26,630
that background at all they need more

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,860
support and they're not maybe maybe need

00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,539
some help with exploring possibilities

00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:31,640
knowing what is out there that can help

00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:33,440
them so they want to solve a particular

00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,929
problem or they wonder if or can I do

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,830
this with code you guys the developers

00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:41,419
you're the people to ask and relevance

00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,010
you know a lot of the sort of teaching

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:44,720
materials that were out there first of

00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,669
all for teaching computer science was

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,830
Raoul here we're going to do a little

00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:50,419
math game where you guess the number and

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,460
we're gonna need some selection to see

00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:55,460
if you're right or wrong or here's a

00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:57,440
teacher tool to will get a right piece

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,870
of code which if you put in score it's

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,220
going to tell you what your grade was

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,419
which students are going to care about

00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:04,760
that they're not it's not particularly

00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:06,530
relevant to them but developers you're

00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,390
out there writing software doing all

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,070
kinds of cool things on things that kids

00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,260
might be aware of whether it's robotics

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,000
or web interfaces or whatever you've got

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,640
relevant experience that you know you

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,980
can show kids cool things and also

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,539
challenging pupils that 16 year old that

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,220
I heard that was a far better program

00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,169
than I you know talking to developers

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,510
means that i can find ways of extending

00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:29,510
them pushing them forward and finding

00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:31,820
new ways to challenge them and an

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,020
enabling learners so this kind of comes

00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:34,370
down to the barriers point that we

00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,080
talked about a little bit earlier on as

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:37,820
a teacher there's lots of little

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,799
frustrations that we have either to do

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,840
with you know network administration the

00:19:39,799 --> 00:19:45,710
interface we're using the library's

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,090
those problems no it's good for us to be

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,970
able to air those somewhere and have

00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:51,860
those conversations and developers so

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:53,510
you guys are great at creating solutions

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,820
it's what you do you know here's a

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:58,759
problem create a solution to solve that

00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,469
okay you've got the really in depth

00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,119
knowledge about how the libraries work

00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:04,940
how they interconnect how we can use

00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:06,440
them you're great at writing libraries

00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:08,389
and tools that teachers can take into

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,739
their classroom and as I mentioned

00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:11,389
you've also got that relevance that

00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:13,059
experience which is current which is

00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:16,759
relevant which is sort of real-world

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:18,289
stuff but perhaps what we can help with

00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:21,079
as teachers is finding new ways to

00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:22,489
engage learners so that idea that you

00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,959
have about how we are we know it's cool

00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,369
thing that we could do you know we can

00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:28,879
maybe work out how to make that more

00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:31,069
engaging for learners and making Python

00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:34,129
more accessible and the reason i chose

00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:37,099
python either and through simplicity and

00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:39,469
accessibility I think that Python should

00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:40,940
be almost the de facto language the text

00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:43,819
based language that kids are using and

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,139
in the UK kind of is you know lots of

00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:47,539
kids and the UK lots of teachers in the

00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:50,209
UK have chosen Python based on other

00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:51,709
teachers recommendations whereas in the

00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:54,769
States we went over there recently and

00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:57,259
it's you know python is used a little

00:20:54,769 --> 00:21:00,229
bit in education but not as much as C

00:20:57,259 --> 00:21:02,269
and Java and processing and JavaScript

00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:07,039
which I find weird because they're just

00:21:02,269 --> 00:21:08,839
so syntax heavy so that's why I think

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,879
the two those two groups bring to it so

00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:12,199
the teachers we kind of help sort of

00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:12,859
sort that progression the bit i'll still

00:21:12,199 --> 00:21:14,449
come up from the learning experience

00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:16,819
earlier on the progression of how we get

00:21:14,449 --> 00:21:18,709
from A to B developers you're great at

00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:20,839
bringing the the purpose the the

00:21:18,709 --> 00:21:22,459
project's those kind of things but the

00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,649
bit was missing is the playfulness and

00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:26,599
that's where day two comes in so day two

00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:28,549
was the bit that I missed and this was

00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:30,019
that I saw pictures the next day of all

00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:31,279
the stuff that was going on and I would

00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:32,839
really wished I could have been there

00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:36,169
rather than knocking down a wall or

00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:37,789
whatever so I just I Nick some pictures

00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,469
from Nick's presentation but you just

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:42,199
kind of shows the journey that kids go

00:21:39,469 --> 00:21:44,599
through a place to his here's the kids

00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:46,129
sitting down and a computer they're

00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:47,119
doing some coding I've got no idea what

00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:48,799
it is they're doing but they're doing

00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,649
some some poison it might be minecraft

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,709
it might be cheaper whatever and you can

00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:56,779
see this look is i-80 maybe in a couple

00:21:54,709 --> 00:21:58,399
that they're a bit I'm sure there's one

00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:00,739
hand on the keyboard there's a few

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:02,299
little things we can notice there few

00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:03,619
minutes later everyone was trying to get

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:05,869
hold on keyboard the mouse they're all

00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:07,759
having a go and this comes back to the

00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:10,599
point that Kerry mentioned her keynote

00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:11,870
that kids are inherently sort of

00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,920
investigative and

00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:17,300
and want to learn okay and they probably

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,710
I mean there is a whole series that

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,420
there's like 10 photos in this series

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,860
and they go through a range of emotions

00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,510
like every human emotion you can almost

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,460
imagine you know there's despair when it

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,410
doesn't work all because of things going

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,660
on but then we get this moment at the

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:31,220
end where they've solved that problem

00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,660
they hate what they've got through all

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,010
those little barriers they've worked out

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,080
what the problem is they've solved it

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:41,510
and the look of satisfaction on their

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:43,580
face is fantastic okay and that's why we

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:45,740
should be getting together as education

00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:48,200
as educationist and developers to

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,790
support these guys okay to make sure

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,429
they're having this experience with

00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,559
coding that they very quickly they don't

00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:57,020
hit that point the first picture and

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,370
stop they're able to get to this point

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,390
where they see the value they get the

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,890
gratification from Coney no idea handing

00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,950
for time Psalms I'm probably running a

00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:09,530
bit short so I'm gonna move on going so

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,720
what's in it for four and the different

00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:13,760
groups so first of all it's fun okay

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,309
whether you're a teacher a developer or

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:21,620
a kid coming to a pipe and education

00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:23,000
event it's tremendous fun huge fun we've

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,320
got a picture up here and the first but

00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,720
you probably see it one of the teachers

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,309
that was on the course sway this is one

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,110
of her tweets shortly afterwards she

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:31,730
tweeted or I've just print something in

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:35,090
my tea in Minecraft I'm having so much

00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:37,429
fun yay okay here are some developers

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:39,710
who are helping us out on the day again

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:41,809
smiling developers having fun enjoying

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,990
themselves okay doing something playful

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:47,179
and creative and and here you put the

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,890
kick in or probably has been i'm not

00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:51,380
sure what was going on there were you

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,090
talking at that point what sure and so

00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,130
the teachers what they get is they get

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,200
coaching support confidence building and

00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,390
that's really important so many teachers

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,370
did not have the background that I had

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:02,870
playing with code a young age and having

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,970
a little bit of experience of it and

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:07,880
that confidence is really important for

00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:09,260
them they get ideas for lessons they

00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,640
collaborate with other teachers they

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,580
collaborate with you guys they can i'm

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,390
right with the kids which in fairness is

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,420
actually where some of these ideas

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:18,770
should be coming from okay because i

00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,190
don't want to teach kids who have to do

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,200
something that I want to do because

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,500
that's my passion not theirs I want them

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,720
to believe in things so I

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,310
getting together with the kids they come

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:33,840
with a good idea you like awesome let's

00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:37,320
make that happen right so we might get

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:41,220
some new tools or contacts out of that

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,710
building on network developers you get

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,600
to adopt a teacher right which which is

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,220
awesome so and I had this experience

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,690
I've sat down with some developers and

00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,140
my project wasn't particularly to do

00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:55,080
with a scheme of work or a learning

00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,450
issue it was more to do with enabling my

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,160
use of github in the classroom so I SAT

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,990
most amazing developers and I said what

00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,730
I want is I want to be able to push

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:04,800
things to get hub that it be private I

00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,810
want like a local kind of github we

00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,280
found get lab which we played around

00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,990
with a little bit and then what I want

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,420
is I want like an automatic backup

00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:14,250
mechanism from my pies so push is there

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,170
and I just got you know a repository

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:18,990
that I can comment on and collaborate

00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:20,130
with the kids for and we started making

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,950
the discussions we played around with

00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:25,440
some ideas they kind of adopted me for

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,470
the day and unfortunately shortly after

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,350
like on that kind of contact that those

00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:33,600
conversations very soon disappeared now

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:35,400
it's perfectly understandable developers

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,370
have day jobs i'm a teacher i'm back in

00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,780
the classroom so it's difficult but if

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:42,270
you are going to do this adopting a

00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,610
tshirt teacher it's really fantastic if

00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,960
you can maintain that relationship

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:47,580
because it is really beneficial to both

00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:51,480
and I'll explain why both in just a

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:53,430
second so and you get to engage teachers

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,960
and kids with the Python community which

00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,340
is a fantastic community and we need to

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,340
get the teachers and kids engage within

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,230
that you get that warm fuzzy feeling

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,930
right which is which is great but also

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,180
this point and it reinforces and I'm

00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:08,100
paraphrasing Nick Tolliver hear of it

00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:10,290
and it reinforces a deeper understanding

00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,540
of your own clarity of thought okay so

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,180
just to unpick that little bit when I

00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:19,500
was a math teacher and I said to a cage

00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:20,850
right well I don't know this is this

00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,280
mathematical concept and the kid would

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:28,740
say well why why is that the case and I

00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:29,730
got one it is it could be get it is I

00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,440
don't know how to break that I only

00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:34,560
further and that was me at the beginning

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,440
of my teaching career not being able to

00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,110
understand that some things aren't

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,610
self-evident

00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:43,240
at that point my knowledge of

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:45,720
mathematics was not deep enough that I

00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,850
could explain that concept to a child

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,559
okay so being able to explain things to

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,350
people that are not experts being able

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,200
to unpick why things are to you may be

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:59,799
self-evident actually gives you a deeper

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:02,799
understanding okay it gives you a better

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:04,929
clarity of thought and the kids will be

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,980
kids get is they get a safe place to

00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:11,470
play and learn okay there's no measuring

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,490
their progress there's no sort of

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,080
feeding back and what they're doing

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,059
apart from in a positive way all I

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,250
didn't work brilliant try this have a go

00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:20,049
okay so they're supported they're

00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,309
encouraged and so on they get to

00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:23,020
collaborate with others and that's

00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:24,480
teachers that's kids lots of kids don't

00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,650
get a chance to collaborate with adults

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,970
so that's fantastic lots of kids don't

00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,250
get a chance to collaborate with other

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,809
groups of kids so bringing them all

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,200
together on this kind of day means they

00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:36,850
get that opportunity and they get a

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,049
sense of pride and achievement I kind of

00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:39,220
photo tower last night that I couldn't

00:27:38,049 --> 00:27:41,230
put it back up here there's a picture of

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,929
nick standing at the front with a kid

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:46,150
and a robot and the kid is just beaming

00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:48,730
because he's sharing his robot robotic

00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:50,650
creation with an audience so they get

00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:52,179
nice sense of I have achieved something

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:53,890
I have done something I am part of

00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,080
something and that's again really

00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,929
powerful the kids and did I mention the

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,970
cake because that was great okay so and

00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:03,280
they just I'm going to just take a brief

00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:08,169
pause this is another perspective this

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:10,299
was a teacher that i'd i'd met on

00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:12,580
twitter i met for the first time at

00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:15,309
PyCon sat down quarter chatted with her

00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,390
and she sent me this because it was her

00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:17,770
point of view so i'm going to shut up

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:20,940
for a second just give you a chance to

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:20,940
read what happens

00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,789
I think there's a couple of points in

00:28:44,019 --> 00:28:48,429
there and sorry for still really on

00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:50,980
parmer just move a little bit couple of

00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:52,179
points in here she regards herself as a

00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:56,350
relatively knowledgeable computing

00:28:52,179 --> 00:29:00,090
teacher but really needs that support or

00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:02,619
values that support from developers and

00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,580
what her kids knee is something exciting

00:29:02,619 --> 00:29:09,309
which we inspire them and teachers don't

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,950
have a huge amount of time ok we you

00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:15,340
know the the working week is very long

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,080
and so anything that developers can do

00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:18,639
or other people within the community to

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,649
say he's this really cool thing by the

00:29:18,639 --> 00:29:22,330
way well not like a conference and I was

00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:24,749
shown here's a library that you can use

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:28,690
which if you just run a command it will

00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:31,480
was it would access the tube times right

00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:34,149
which is super exciting but it's way

00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,950
more exciting than like just crunching a

00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:38,950
few numbers arbitrarily and in a very

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:40,989
trite example so this is really really

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:43,379
powerful and there's a link there flavor

00:29:40,989 --> 00:29:46,659
whole blog post all about the

00:29:43,379 --> 00:29:49,739
experiences of PyCon i recommend that if

00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:52,840
you're interested you you check that out

00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:55,090
ok and how can you help and again I will

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,639
be reiterating a few points from

00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,289
carry-ons talked earlier on so firstly

00:29:57,639 --> 00:30:00,519
the adopter teacher right and that

00:29:59,289 --> 00:30:01,629
doesn't have to be through app icon

00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,690
event or any kind of physical

00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:06,220
face-to-face meet up in your local area

00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,080
wherever you are find out what your

00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,359
teachers are doing in terms of computing

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,429
programming that kind of side of the

00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:14,470
curriculum find out if you can support

00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:16,090
them will can you go in and I'd know who

00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:18,309
my next point is talk about computing in

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:19,720
your local school go and talk about the

00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:21,730
fun bits about you know your day job

00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,230
right go and explain the cool things

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,700
that you do with code and how it

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,970
empowers you and what you know what you

00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,289
love about it and help develop tools and

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,409
libraries that support learners and

00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:34,179
again we've got you've got you've google

00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:38,249
the homework that carry on set and say

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:40,960
we should all be working on that ok and

00:30:38,249 --> 00:30:42,820
run a workshop or a talk for educated

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,980
and again that could be at an event like

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:47,080
pycon it could be at a local networking

00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:49,389
meeting it could be that you if you run

00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,249
like a local place an interest group

00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,659
type thing you know fight some teachers

00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,119
get them to come along and find out what

00:30:52,659 --> 00:30:55,589
pythons all about have they got

00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:58,949
questions about point on how to use it

00:30:55,589 --> 00:31:01,499
in the classroom um code club I don't

00:30:58,949 --> 00:31:03,569
know if how many people are aware of co

00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:07,229
club or or how you access them code club

00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:09,869
is a great resource it enables kind of a

00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:11,789
partnering scheme for getting experts to

00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:14,399
go into schools work with kids run sort

00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:16,769
of workshops and that's great because it

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,079
means that the teacher doesn't have to

00:31:16,769 --> 00:31:20,189
they can attend and support you but they

00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:22,709
don't have to be providing all the

00:31:20,189 --> 00:31:24,239
material they that you get a chance to

00:31:22,709 --> 00:31:25,469
network it gives you an end if you know

00:31:24,239 --> 00:31:28,109
sometimes it can be difficult from the

00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:29,729
outside to get in with a school going

00:31:28,109 --> 00:31:32,549
for something like Oakland might be the

00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:34,529
way to do that and you know they're

00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,599
probably a whole ton of things that we

00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:39,599
not thought of amazing things that you

00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:42,179
could do to help engage kids and

00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,339
teachers a with a Python community and

00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,899
with the language itself so if you've

00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:48,449
got any of the cool ideas come and find

00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:50,279
anyone from Raspberry Pi education team

00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:51,919
come a chat with us if you've got no

00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:54,389
idea about something you'd like to do

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,519
then we're happy to have that

00:31:54,389 --> 00:31:58,319
conversation and then I've just I've

00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,349
left some time for questions so there we

00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,349
go

00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:17,020
thanks for your shark was very

00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:20,500
interesting I was very I liked the kid

00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,470
stay thing do you know how old the kids

00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,640
were I'm gonna have to defer it was

00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:32,230
organizing what was the range of the

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:34,120
kids their neck and I think that's

00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,060
important as well that it's not limited

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,220
on age and because it means that the

00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,870
older kids can turn mental the younger

00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,570
kids and do all the younger kids can

00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,440
meant all the other kids and lots of

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,630
great opportunities for those

00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,190
deliberation nicked on you sorry I got

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,190
my hand up I feel like I'm a child at it

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:53,710
from risk so those photos of the

00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:56,400
children that we saw programming in the

00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:59,950
series of the longer series of photos

00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:04,210
actually the kid in the middle at the

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:06,550
the last one he came along and mentored

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,080
the other two so they had a problem he

00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,090
came along there's a picture of him

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,560
pointing at the screen and something

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:13,960
goes wrong and then altogether thing

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,980
they put it right so the important thing

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,900
about this site is that there are no

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,600
adults involved in this learning as well

00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,910
this is the autonomous you know kids

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,710
picking up for themselves I think that's

00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:27,220
an important point as well as as as a

00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:29,020
Dalton knowing when to step in so in a

00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,490
classroom I would often encourage the

00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:32,590
kids to sort of you know make their

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,960
first few steps by themself and only

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,400
company horsemeat help when they when

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,410
they you know have hit three or four

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:44,230
problems because otherwise they feel

00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:47,790
they have to defer to that Idol all

00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:47,790
