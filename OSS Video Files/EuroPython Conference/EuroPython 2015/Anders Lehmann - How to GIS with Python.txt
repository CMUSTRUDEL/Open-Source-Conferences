	Anders Lehmann - How to GIS with Python
[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

In this talk I will present some tools for working with Geographic
Information Systems in Python.

Geographic information Systems are widely used for managing geographic
(map) data. As an example I will present how to use Open Street Map
data (http://openstreetmap.org/), in routing, traffic planning and
estimation of pollution emission.

For the purpose of the project EcoSense (http://ecosense.au.dk), GPS
data from users smartphones are mapped to OSM roads. The map matching
algorithm is written in Python and uses data from the database
PostgreSQL, with the PostGIS extension.

One of the goals of the EcoSense project is to devise methods to
improve the estimation of air quality in urban environments.
