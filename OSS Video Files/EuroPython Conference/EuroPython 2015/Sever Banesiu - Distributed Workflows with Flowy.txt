[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

This presentation introduces Flowy, a library for building and running
distributed, asynchronous workflows built on top of different backends
(such as Amazonâ€™s SWF). Flowy deals away with the spaghetti code that
often crops up from orchestrating complex workflows. It is ideal for
applications that do multi-phased batch processing, media encoding,
long-running tasks, and/or background processing.

We'll start by discussing Flowy's unique execution model and see how
different execution topologies can be implemented on top of it. During
the talk we'll run and visualize workflows using a local backend.
We'll then take a look at what it takes to scale beyond a single
machine by using an external service like SWF.
