We need help with organizing and running EuroPython 2016.

In this session, we will explain how the EuroPython workgroup model works
and where you could help.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,509
and let's beauties together so hello

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,620
there hello everyone I'd like to welcome

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,179
you to the europass in 2016 session and

00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,009
we're going to do the talk together i'm

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,870
going to do with the first few slides

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,369
and then later on this have you is going

00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:19,470
to join in and of course if you have

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:22,830
questions just feel feel feel free to

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,119
ask during the presentation we don't

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,349
want to put everything at the end

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,240
because then we used to lose the context

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:36,469
first of all a question how many of you

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:41,610
know what the eps is how many don't know

00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:44,129
ok so the eps was founded in 2004 when

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:48,750
we found that organizing europe as

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,550
neuropathic started in 2002 and by 2004

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,489
we wanted to have an organization that

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,559
basically holds the IP rights of the of

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,660
the conference and make sure that it's a

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:01,350
continuous process that the selection

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:05,640
process works for each new location that

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:09,689
the the transfer of knowledge works from

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,840
one location to the next and the

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,979
european society was supposed to back up

00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:19,619
the local organizers at the time so the

00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,020
way that worked was that the european

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,240
society had the the trademarks the logo

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,360
and the it was supposed to have the

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,869
social accounts of for the for the

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,329
conference the eps used to select just

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,299
select the the conference location it

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,070
did not actually run the conference

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,170
itself that was being done by local

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:44,070
organizers but every now and then we

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,009
when we switched we had a CFP process to

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,780
then determine the new location and then

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:54,750
work with the local organizers to

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:57,570
actually make it happen in 2015 we

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,909
thought that or we realize that the old

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,110
model of doing this with no longer work

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,290
out because we had serious problems

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:08,880
finding you local organizers doing the

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:11,220
conference because it had grown this big

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,080
I mean this this year for example we

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,150
have eleven hundred attendees last year

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,790
we had twelve hundred attendees so

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:20,430
that's a size where you cannot easily

00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,410
just do the the conference organization

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,290
like that on the side yeah it's actually

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,050
a full-time job for for quite a few

00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,330
organizers and so we thought that we use

00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:33,150
a work group model to make it possible

00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:36,150
to scale this up in a better way and the

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,880
work groups are meant to allow work to

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,230
be done remotely so there are lots of

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,670
things that you can do remotely for

00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,100
example you can manage the website

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,870
remotely you can do with communications

00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:48,810
remotely you can do marketing and these

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,320
things remotely and this is what we

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:56,670
started this year for the first time and

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,790
it has not yet really worked out all the

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,340
way but I think we were doing fine in

00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,050
developing this kind of model and we're

00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,300
definitely going to continue using it

00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,400
one of the most important things there

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,680
is that we wanted to reduce the loss of

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,110
institutional knowledge from location to

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,140
location because we always had in the

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,210
past we always had an issue having the

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,920
the knowledge that was gained at one

00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,050
location being transferred to the next

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,230
location usually what happened is that

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:27,810
we get a complete new website software

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,760
set up so your python has I think about

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:34,500
six or seven different website systems

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,450
right by now the only little details

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,130
that you you find when organizing a

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,620
conference those teachers were usually

00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:42,209
not transferred to the next year so the

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,720
same mistakes happened over and over

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,820
again and of course there's a financial

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,360
risk associated with this and we wanted

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,370
to reduce that risk and and have the EPS

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,530
sign contracts instead of having a local

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,720
organizer sign the contracts now this

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,350
year we tried that it didn't work out

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,980
because we couldn't manage the vit taxes

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:06,959
with the EPS the try to get a vit ID for

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,630
this but it the Swedish government

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,410
wouldn't give us one so we have a deal

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:15,510
with that next year so the lock under

00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:19,020
the new structure the local team is

00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:21,180
meant to just do the on-site work and we

00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:24,360
try to do most of the other

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:26,880
remotely now in practice this for this

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,639
year it hasn't really worked out that

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,169
well so what happens that even though we

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,150
we had the work groups most of the

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,490
active members in those work groups were

00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:38,930
actually members from the on-site team

00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,500
plus a few members from the EPS board

00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:49,020
but we just started this year so we have

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:51,449
good hopes for for the next year's right

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,400
so just a few dates maybe to show you

00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,199
how the whole thing developed in July

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,910
last year we had the election of the new

00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:04,050
board then in October we did the CFP for

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:06,870
your pattern rather late by December we

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:11,970
announce the winner the AC pi SS is

00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:14,340
Python San Sebastian user group and in

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,650
January mid-january actually we started

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,470
to work with the AC pious as to to run

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,630
the conference so regardless conference

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:23,310
itself the whole conference was was set

00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,510
up in a very very short time as you can

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:29,370
see in January 2015 we also because we

00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:32,130
started with the workers we set up all

00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,960
the infrastructure for the workgroups so

00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,699
we're using mating list for that we're

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,889
using lumio for voting we're using

00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,560
Trello for a few work groups to to

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:43,380
manage the various tasks we set up a

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,539
pre-launch website too because people

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:48,120
were starting to ask when where the

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,250
website was and we set up this primo

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,740
pre-launch website because it took a bit

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,460
longer to lecture on actually launched

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,009
the the final version of the website

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:03,479
then in March we managed to get the

00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:05,849
final website running the website was

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,960
using the code base that was used in

00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:11,280
Florence because that was very complete

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,419
conference software and as you can see

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,080
this year again there are lots of lots

00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,430
of cool features in that software and we

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,500
once we managed to get it working it

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,810
really worked very nicely and so we

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,110
didn't have to do anything much to to

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,760
make it work like what you see now so

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,550
then in March we also launched ticket

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,569
sales and then we ran the cultural

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,639
proposals again rather late

00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:39,550
in April we had this podcast issue with

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,389
which was did actually the first bigger

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:46,080
EOC issue that we had in May we had the

00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:49,449
fin aid program set up and announced and

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,979
the talk boarding was started talk

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,300
wording was not done last year it was

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,209
done in Florence and it was also

00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:57,550
invented in Florence it was a very good

00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:00,580
kind of it turned out to be a very good

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,759
way to to figure out which talks talk

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:07,779
proposals to accept it works kind of

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,939
like crowdsourcing effort so basically

00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,159
all the people that have bought tickets

00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:14,830
can then go to the website and vote on

00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:16,779
the different taco puzzles and then the

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,669
program work group would then take those

00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:22,990
results and based on those results would

00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,300
then go ahead and and actually do the

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,909
selection so the the selection was

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:32,289
mainly done on the based on the results

00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:35,979
from the top-loading but the program

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:37,689
work group of course also took care to

00:07:35,979 --> 00:07:40,689
for example increase the diversity of

00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:45,719
the number of the of the speakers of the

00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:50,110
number of talks that we're done by women

00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:53,949
it also took care that each speaker only

00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,229
well we try to have each speaker only do

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,269
one taught so that you can get we can

00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,309
get more and more speakers instead of

00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:05,889
having one speaker do five talks and the

00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:07,689
other just maybe one so i think i'm one

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,669
of the notable notable exceptions here

00:08:07,689 --> 00:08:11,559
because i did edit one talk for for

00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,959
europe and in the python context and i'm

00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:16,509
now together with fabio doing to other

00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:17,829
talks just the EPS stuff but this is

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:22,839
more on the side of the conference

00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:26,680
that's not really the normal case right

00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:29,939
and then in in June we had the schedule

00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,139
online took a bit to get that set up

00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,419
again because we had a few issues with

00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:37,300
the website but we finally figure out

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,610
how to actually publish the website the

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,169
schedule on the website and then in in

00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,860
July we followed up with the guy put

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,670
application and now we have Europe

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,279
and today we have the General Assembly

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,620
so overall it took just six months

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,500
organized this conference which I find

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,300
really impressing and it's a and we

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,579
really have to thank the local team a

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,620
lot for this because without them this

00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:14,700
wouldn't have happened so I think we

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:19,680
should give them a good applause so

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,760
thank you for that right and just to

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,910
give you an impression of how the

00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,190
development was with Europe Python we'd

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,010
started very small and with 240 people

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,890
in shadow Ryan Belgium and then every

00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,019
year did include the the attendee size

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,990
increased a bit when we went to Vilnius

00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,420
in Lithuania it went down again a bit

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,820
because it's a bit far away for many

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,180
people but it was still very interesting

00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:48,240
in Vilnius then in Birmingham it picked

00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:52,230
up again and last year we had was 500 we

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,380
have had the peak so far in the bow it

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:57,779
it decreased by about a hundred which is

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,730
not really much and given that Berlin is

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:03,690
right at the center of everything and

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:06,149
he's very easy to get there and they are

00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:09,060
very very good train connections and

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:13,470
everything so it's not surprising that

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:17,160
Bilbao has decreased a bit we hope to

00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:19,949
increase that again a bit by maybe a few

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,750
hundred next year we have to see how

00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:23,810
that happens I think that when when

00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,670
people go home again and they know how

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,480
well organized this conference was and

00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:32,930
how beautiful the location is and

00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,089
beautiful Bilbao is I think God will

00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:38,699
definitely come back and get us more

00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:41,519
attendees next year which is good

00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:43,380
because I mean more attendees of course

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,050
also means more work but it also means

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,810
more sponsors and and sponsorship is

00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:51,420
very important for for the EPS because

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,420
in the long run what we would like to be

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,490
as something like a European kind of

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,819
version of Python software foundation so

00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,910
that

00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,739
we we try to use the conference to make

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,100
money and then to redistribute that

00:11:01,739 --> 00:11:07,499
money to the European Python community

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,929
so what we ideally in longer would like

00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:12,119
to have is a Grants program where you

00:11:09,929 --> 00:11:14,069
can go to the EPS and ask for grants for

00:11:12,119 --> 00:11:17,609
running smaller conferences or running

00:11:14,069 --> 00:11:20,069
projects in Python and so we this is all

00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:23,039
long-term goal for this and for that we

00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:24,569
need to increase the sponsorship from

00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,489
what we currently have at the moment

00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:31,429
where did this conference for example

00:11:26,489 --> 00:11:35,009
the sponsorship revenue is about 175 180

00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:37,319
thousand euros which is really not much

00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:39,479
I mean if you look at pike on us back on

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:42,779
us has way over a million dollars in

00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:46,949
sponsorship money every year so there's

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:49,519
a quite a big they have about well

00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:56,879
between 2000 3000 I think it's about

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:58,679
2500 at the moment so I mean compared to

00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,470
European your patent has about a

00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,139
thousand but I mean the it's just quite

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:07,019
double the size and but the sponsorship

00:12:04,139 --> 00:12:08,579
money there's what I mean in DSS much

00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,529
easier to get sponsors because they're

00:12:08,579 --> 00:12:12,839
very open to sponsor me things and in

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,879
Europe it's not that easy so we have to

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,100
try to talk to all the big sponsors at

00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:19,470
that you have it back on us for example

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,350
whether they would like to do the same

00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:24,119
kind of thing in in Europe you can see

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,019
that with with Google for example it has

00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:31,189
worked out great thanks to Fabio's good

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:34,829
connections to to the Google sponsorship

00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:37,289
contact they really invested a lot of

00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:39,299
money this year we are trying to do the

00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:42,419
same with Intel we're trying to do the

00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:44,909
same with Microsoft and with Facebook so

00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:46,409
we need to get better connections to

00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:48,419
them better build better relationships

00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:51,499
with them and then make everything

00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:53,789
bigger so now I'm going to pass over to

00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:55,999
Fabio he's going to talk about the work

00:12:53,789 --> 00:12:55,999
groups

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:29,040
we have a slide and yeah maybe it's not

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:33,420
in this one let's see one thing a couple

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,699
of things I wanted to mention as sorry i

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,259
ah I know bilbeis in the center of the

00:13:35,699 --> 00:13:47,880
world but the lane is more connected

00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:52,009
that was a statement and add the other

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:59,389
thing was I wanted to mention is that I

00:13:52,009 --> 00:14:03,810
had many people asking about how around

00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:07,050
regarding the website and how they did

00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:11,190
that it was hired to help and how we

00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:13,980
chose how come we chose the Italian

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:18,600
version instead of the last year version

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:22,110
and the background is that we contacted

00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,569
both the main developers of Italian and

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,459
the German versions and based on the

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:33,720
support because we didn't have much

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:36,480
resources both were very they said to be

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,290
very honored for for the request but the

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,459
italian team turned out to be ready to

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:46,769
do more more more work so it's both most

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:53,490
of its to say that both saw for software

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:59,060
board great software as well one so the

00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:03,990
work groups that the work groups concept

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:08,519
we had in mind is that we had one group

00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:11,699
work group chair person or two in

00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,850
depending on the work group size working

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:17,189
members that would focus on specific

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,149
topics and specific things of the

00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:23,189
conference that could you work remotely

00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:26,329
and we could organize those work groups

00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:28,100
with voting members and

00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:37,699
few other working no voting voting

00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:41,059
members the teams were sorry were built

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:44,029
looking to set to tackle a conference

00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:47,600
administration so having to run contract

00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:50,689
with the venue tickets support one

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:57,350
finance group to control our budget do

00:15:50,689 --> 00:16:00,230
accounting feelings check out connect

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:04,519
with other work groups that needed

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,290
something from the budget sponsors so

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:11,449
for instance sponsors and finance work

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:13,699
very connected work groups Oh sponsors

00:16:11,449 --> 00:16:17,949
of course was were in charge to contact

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:21,459
new sponsors handle sponsors logistics

00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:24,249
explore sponsors needs and everything

00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:28,579
communications do presley release

00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:31,790
community relations work on the

00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:37,759
diversity not reach called code of

00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:46,129
conduct follow-up with mailing lists the

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:50,749
support help desk contact attendees help

00:16:46,129 --> 00:16:54,309
with visas financial aid handle the

00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:57,220
grant selection set up Prince eight

00:16:54,309 --> 00:17:01,489
organized aid put up information

00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:06,579
marketing the do their jobs the program

00:17:01,489 --> 00:17:06,579
that mark marc-andre already told about

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:16,189
which is repeated the webwork rope to

00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:19,069
end up basically the website and

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:23,029
everything related the media team to the

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:28,220
video recording and translations and of

00:17:23,029 --> 00:17:30,980
course the most important team and the

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:34,210
on-site team to handle as a two track as

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,429
a glue for those those work groups and

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:38,160
work locally on all the providers the

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:40,310
venue

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:48,290
all the needed regarding catering

00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:50,970
printing logistics and everything we

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,420
thought since the beginning this was

00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:57,000
quite important to have guidelines to

00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:59,010
get communications right avoid putting

00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,250
people in a place where they couldn't

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:06,750
actually understand where they could

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:08,940
help the guidelines are necessary

00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:12,420
weren't necessary for those groups also

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:15,690
because toot welcome new people and and

00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:19,470
that dress how they could help to keep

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:22,170
the knowledge and hopefully act as a

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:27,330
code code base to improve and then

00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:30,840
nearly the new additions the purpose is

00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:33,000
that the guidelines evolved pretty much

00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,970
in line with the conference's additions

00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,550
so every year we learn something new

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:41,220
every year we have new members new ideas

00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:44,790
and we really think that those

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,580
guidelines should should just be written

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:50,400
by the volunteers and the people doing

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,050
the conference and hopefully from the

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,940
feedback from the people enjoying the

00:18:52,050 --> 00:19:02,850
conference as well we did a lot of we

00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:05,640
had a lot of content to wiki and I knew

00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:10,290
a kid with the content we set up a few

00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:12,180
procedures and documents to handle on

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:17,010
the communicator they're gonna end up in

00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:20,250
the conference workflows and needs so at

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:24,740
the end of the day this year was was

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:29,550
pretty much a dense ear and hard here

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:35,160
but an overall I think this year was

00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:37,830
really a big step forward on building

00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,470
something that can stand for for the

00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:46,380
future editions we reviewed a lot of

00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:49,800
things many things may not be great on

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,850
the workflow side of things but we

00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,390
really I think this is

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:59,110
real proof that we can can he'll know

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:01,179
this if we could especially the team

00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:04,390
from bball could organize a conference

00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:10,510
like this in six months with a lot of

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:15,179
tension al a small time and and many

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:20,289
unplanned surprises like for instance

00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:22,600
starting with a number of volunteers and

00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:27,850
ending up with fraction of that number

00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:31,630
pretty soon that proves that we really

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:34,900
can do incredible stuff if we have time

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:43,179
we can do even better so I guess that's

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:46,120
that those are your Python society

00:20:43,179 --> 00:20:50,380
contacts or information you can check

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:53,470
out the website we have a blog in every

00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,780
request there are many channels you can

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,400
contact the do your Python society even

00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,220
through the board or the mailing lists

00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:03,640
or other channels so I invite everyone

00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:09,130
that wants to help to step ahead help

00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:14,820
propose ideas and keep keep helping us

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:14,820
doing what we do that's that's all thank

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:36,020
okay so anybody got questions no so

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,320
thank you very much for organizing it

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:42,260
it's amazing conference I have just just

00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:45,290
two things like I wanted to raise leg so

00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:47,840
talk voting so it was really amazing

00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:50,050
compared to some centralized Commission

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,270
which was picking up like few years ago

00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:55,250
the only thing is like I think that

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,930
everyone should have like an limited

00:21:55,250 --> 00:22:02,930
amount of votes that you can give

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:05,630
because otherwise you have a how to say

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:07,940
that lots of talks that had very catchy

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,280
titles I were not fulfilling the promise

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,370
and I think that a catchy title itself

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,020
because of the freedom of you know

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,510
voting for as many talks as you want I

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:21,880
think that it biased those sketchy

00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:24,440
titles doors actually being selected see

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,990
perhaps Alex wants to say something

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,380
about that because he was he is one of

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:32,090
the well one of the two Alex with anyway

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:33,380
it just my only thing is like whenever

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,440
you are going with the model of

00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,330
crowdfunding or crowd voting it's like

00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,640
you always seem to introduce the concept

00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:42,590
of some kind of currency right otherwise

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,530
if it's unlimited then you introduce

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:47,750
lots of biases and it comes from the

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,700
fact that because everyone has a limited

00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:52,580
time here so basically I make sense that

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:55,010
everyone can vote as to as many talks as

00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,930
you can attend basically a 20 or

00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:58,790
something and that's it so basically I

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,620
can I can answer that directly from the

00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:03,740
bolted prog rock group thanks for the

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,410
import basically have some similar

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:07,990
results because but on top walking we

00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:10,750
spend a lot of time on the air

00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:13,870
rhythm comparing and it was not just

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,990
like number of votes it was one more

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,700
complicated thing it isn't also

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,980
algorithm it's more like preferences so

00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,410
it does didn't really matter if you

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:27,070
voted for many talks because we didn't

00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:29,080
not not only sum up the points would you

00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:31,179
do it comparison averages and said and

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,780
what we made finally used the algorithm

00:23:31,179 --> 00:23:36,910
with also Italian brought to us we

00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:40,990
mangled change it a bit so there was no

00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:42,730
possibility of downloading ah but there

00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:45,000
are some things I think we can improve

00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:48,070
on the voting process ah because it's

00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,290
for me but limited only to people having

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,600
a ticket I'm want to suggest that we

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:54,970
include people probably having attended

00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,309
one euro Python because basically we

00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:59,140
want to build a great conference for

00:23:57,309 --> 00:24:02,230
attendees and but we don't want spamming

00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:06,220
with people making multiple accounts so

00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:07,720
basically yeah what what was good last

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,640
year is that there was like some kind of

00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,740
feedback you to give you can include

00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:23,860
that question to to the people creating

00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:26,050
the talk so there was so my only like

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,000
issue here is like it's actually amazing

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:30,730
that that you decided to go this path

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,650
rather than actually making the whole

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:37,210
voting closed but I'm saying like if we

00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:40,420
really want to achieve the transparency

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:44,730
of the selection you know either we go

00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:47,050
with the crowd voting and then like like

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:50,320
crowd voting that is fully transparent

00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,700
or like some hybrid system where you say

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,460
like you can vote would actually don't

00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,140
vote because after that would be some

00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:59,200
algorithm with whatever you did actually

00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:02,050
vote for it it's I mean it's all

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,120
available on the website and it it just

00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:07,960
nothing really hidden the way that

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,090
worked was that we basically use the

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,370
system looked at all the voting results

00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:15,490
and then the voting results were then

00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:17,309
used by the program work group to then

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,230
make the actual selection

00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:23,809
so what for example the program group

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:26,730
did was instead of having 10 talks about

00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:29,460
maybe I don't know I think I oh yeah

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,289
which is very popular this year they

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,350
just selected a few of those and then

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,570
instead gave the preference to two other

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,490
subjects which were a bit under

00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,649
represented in the talk voting results

00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:42,720
so the the voting results will use as

00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:45,299
basis for the selection but i think it's

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,919
already a large step forward because we

00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:51,809
don't have this kind of committee

00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:55,019
decision process for the for the for the

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:57,600
talks we sometimes get biases from from

00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:02,460
those committees into the talks election

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:05,249
so that happens sometimes really well

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,470
but if everyone is voting and it's a

00:26:05,249 --> 00:26:10,529
like a decision of everyone to have

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:12,960
certain kind of talks and i think that's

00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:17,490
a community decision like the community

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:20,879
decided i want to have ten i sink just

00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:25,889
wanted to make one comment that takes

00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:29,269
account i mean also like why the dead

00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:35,690
talk holding was introducing 2011 and

00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:40,919
there was a progression on one side

00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:47,039
imagine handling what 3 3 100 talks that

00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:50,610
you need to review look at it and it

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,830
turns out that public voting if you see

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:56,789
the people voting I don't think anyone

00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:59,580
about all of the talks I can't remember

00:26:56,789 --> 00:27:02,330
anyone that actually voted every talk

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:06,299
it's you need to spend the whole day

00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:09,779
clicking I took a very difficult thing

00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:12,029
and it's a very interesting topic we

00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:14,460
picked what seemed to be

00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:16,799
compromise that's a actually that there

00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,679
are many theories about how we should do

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:25,219
this is very interesting this discussion

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:29,669
so other the source is of is open source

00:27:25,219 --> 00:27:31,889
we could try and maybe put some link

00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:37,590
regarding that the algorithms we have

00:27:31,889 --> 00:27:40,679
used if you care about that and you want

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:43,830
to improve it I would really like invite

00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,669
you to make suggestions or try and prove

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:49,830
that we are all open to throw alexia oh

00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:51,509
yeah definitely uncomfortable saying yes

00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,159
from the perspective of person that is

00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:56,210
willing to contribute to them oh sure

00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,700
sure sure it's not like really really

00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:01,619
completely clean discussion is it's

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:06,659
really because it's a hard thing to do

00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:10,049
and the thing that we chose to not do

00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:15,919
everything bolted is because to avoid

00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:19,519
some sort of bugs in attendees

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,229
preferences like we care a lot about

00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,950
diversity we care a lot about giving the

00:28:22,229 --> 00:28:27,779
opportunity to everyone to talk so

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,339
people are biased by their friends by

00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,009
advised by people that they already

00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:35,909
known so it would be hard for someone

00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:37,999
like young I don't have enough

00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:41,700
experience that I have enough visibility

00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:44,879
to get into talking just because someone

00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:47,159
that is really known have 10 dogs you

00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:50,129
know so it's hard hard thing to balance

00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,559
it's really hard and just close this

00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:55,960
year that the program work group was

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:58,120
fairly limited like

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,540
you can you can understand by people

00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:03,700
nothing ok so the program work group is

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:10,390
really light more or less in the front

00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:13,060
row so no no they're more network it's

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:16,180
just to say that we had a lot of yes yes

00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:19,480
sorry i don't know but i can count on

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:22,180
two hands and we made a lot of requests

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:23,860
for people to contribute so really if

00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:28,540
you care or other people care about

00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:30,160
doing this beer I just wanted to add one

00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,010
thing because we have to switch to the

00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:34,570
General Assembly now if you want to sign

00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:36,130
up for one of these work groups and you

00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:38,320
interested in helping out and improving

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:41,740
Europe eyes on how its organized and

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,680
then please submit an application

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,200
request for that you go to our website

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,850
where's my mouse there it is you go to

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,610
the website you go to Europe eyes and

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:57,360
workgroups and this lists all the work

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:57,360
groups again and at the very bottom you

00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:04,540
where is it there you go at the very

00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,130
bottom you see this the mailing address

00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,540
here that with the board meeting address

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,940
and then you just send an email there

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:12,330
say ok I would like to work in this and

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:16,680
that and that work group and then

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:16,680
basically we set you up for it

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,159
no no you don't have to re-sign up and

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,779
honor the Idaho plea the idea behind the

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:30,789
work loops us that they persist from

00:30:28,779 --> 00:30:32,830
year to year and and you can stay as

00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,590
long as you want to if you don't want to

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:37,629
be on the work anymore you can just tell

00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,549
us and then we just remove your phone

00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:41,440
the work group again so it's a very kind

00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:44,200
of open process we're not making any

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,149
bigger restrictions there the only thing

00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,090
that we sometimes do is we asked the

00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:51,999
chairs of those work groups whether they

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,590
need more help in specific area because

00:30:51,999 --> 00:30:56,559
sometimes people sign up for multiple

00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:58,269
work groups and then we sign them up for

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,990
those work groups that need more help

00:30:58,269 --> 00:31:03,549
rather than work groups that are very

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:06,190
popular for example the program work

00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:09,129
group was very popular so we had lots of

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,320
nuts members in it unfortunately not all

00:31:09,129 --> 00:31:12,879
these members were really active in the

00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,419
end even though we had lots of members

00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:19,119
in the work group the actual work was

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:20,710
only done by very few people and we've

00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,659
seen similar things in other work groups

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:27,759
but for the program work group well it

00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:29,440
was it was really an exception so we're

00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,330
trying to change that and if you have

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,919
suggestions on how to change that that

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,369
would be very welcome because we don't

00:31:32,919 --> 00:31:39,730
really know how to address this but once

00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:44,100
it's a suggestion that was made with for

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:47,409
example to to assign tasks to people and

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:49,450
do that specifically so tell someone to

00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:51,369
do a certain task and come back maybe in

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,980
two weeks and with that finished asked

00:31:51,369 --> 00:31:56,799
to do it that way so that people feel

00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,240
addressed and don't just see something

00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,950
happening on the mailing list and then

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,139
thinking that well someone's going to do

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:07,360
it anyway so I don't have to look into

00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:09,369
this that may be one way to to try to

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,499
improve this we'd have to experiment

00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:14,259
with that a bit if you have other

00:32:11,499 --> 00:32:16,450
suggestions yeah please please tell us

00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:19,379
because I mean this is we're all

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,789
volunteers were all working together and

00:32:19,379 --> 00:32:23,619
we don't want to put too much pressure

00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:26,259
on people but on the other hand we also

00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:29,340
don't want to have a few people burn out

00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:32,159
because they have to do too much work

00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,100
there was one question back there yeah

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,350
over here yeah watch me I wanted to

00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:43,269
first of all all of you have to know

00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:47,200
that the I was involved in the program

00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:50,649
and programming work group I saw people

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:54,220
corresponding in email at two or three

00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:59,379
in the morning right they work very very

00:32:54,220 --> 00:33:02,649
hard okay all of us I made a very little

00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:06,460
contribution but all all of you was

00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:10,480
something huge the work that you did

00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:15,970
here for my point about the devoting

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:20,549
that we were talking now I an amazing

00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:25,990
other people wearing some kind of

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:31,990
deadlock situation I wanted to come here

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:35,820
I submitted a proposal when it was the

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:41,350
submission of proposals and my my

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:45,730
university finance my my my arrival here

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:51,100
in condition that my proposal where will

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:55,809
be accepted but but I could not I could

00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:58,509
not vote if I in not pay the ticket but

00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:00,850
if I don't have the budget I cannot play

00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:04,299
the ticket but I don't have divided

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:08,049
because my proposal was not a was not

00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:11,619
accepted then rasa a dead log in the

00:34:08,049 --> 00:34:14,889
last day i paid from my pocket for the

00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:17,440
ticket and then voted and my proposal

00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:21,040
was accepted as a poster and then i

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:25,659
received the financial aid of of the

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:30,250
university then we have to to find some

00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:33,069
way that people that presented a

00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:38,470
submitted a proposal but did not pay the

00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:42,500
ticket will be able to vote for for all

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:45,290
all the proposals right and they

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:49,419
when they have the money they will be

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:52,250
able to to pay for the ticket this is a

00:34:49,419 --> 00:34:55,669
complicated situation I know it's not

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:59,480
something so so simple but we have to

00:34:55,669 --> 00:35:03,170
think what is the best solution for this

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:06,970
deadlock situation will have to

00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:09,620
experiment without a bit we actually we

00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:12,500
simply took the the code that was there

00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:16,930
and just switched it on and basically

00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:20,150
let the web code take care of this and

00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,470
I'm not really sure I did one experiment

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,480
and i found that you don't actually have

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,610
to buy a ticket to do the talk folding

00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,230
but maybe that was just because my user

00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:30,020
account is switched on as a staff

00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:31,640
account I don't know could be so we

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,860
definitely have to look into that for

00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,380
the future yeah I actually didn't want

00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,690
to refer to that but I'll quickly add to

00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,660
that that other people who ask for

00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,450
financial aid and don't know for a while

00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,070
if they get it and can come here would

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,930
be cool for them to also be able to vote

00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:50,120
um but I would actually wanted to say

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:52,070
about the work groups because I just had

00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,620
a look and the program worker was indeed

00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:57,350
huge online wouldn't it make sense to

00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:00,050
maybe kick people out again that do not

00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:03,050
contribute because otherwise the groups

00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,870
will increase in numbers it's a number

00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:08,030
of members and and it doesn't make sense

00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:10,610
to have like a huge list of people to

00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,770
refer to that don't do the work and it's

00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:15,050
just a no a handful of people who

00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:17,540
actually do the work soon yeah that's a

00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,610
very good suggestion I think we should

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,610
probably have some kind of policy for

00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:26,150
this maybe if a member is not active for

00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,010
a few months then we married just then

00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,720
remove that number from them from the

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,750
workbook because otherwise it wouldn't

00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,390
make sense like you say yeah yeah is it

00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:37,250
good just that last question because it

00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:40,580
has to start with Lee a less comment

00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:43,490
about as we have our having about a lot

00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:47,000
of ideas new things were actually

00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:50,180
another thing that we would like to is

00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,299
to be more trying to be more open

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:57,209
transparent during the process to also

00:36:54,299 --> 00:37:00,630
let people know more about how much we

00:36:57,209 --> 00:37:03,119
are spending or on financial aid how

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:05,400
much should we spend because financial

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,069
aid is a very difficult topic because

00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,509
it's hard to say how much will be able

00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:15,900
to to spend many many times we did

00:37:12,509 --> 00:37:18,509
financial aid and helped with a red

00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,569
budget situation you know risking a lot

00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:24,229
of things just because no no no no I

00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:28,380
don't know I I wanted to try this

00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:30,599
discussion saying that as much as the

00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:35,819
community understand the difficulties of

00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:39,119
of doing this and the more maybe people

00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:43,279
can make suggestions or ideas about how

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:48,829
we can tackle this promise that's that i

00:37:43,279 --> 00:37:52,319
would like to look a little beyond 2016

00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:55,529
I think it's really really important for

00:37:52,319 --> 00:38:01,920
your Python to have a vision about where

00:37:55,529 --> 00:38:07,079
we want to go I'm actually somewhat

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:10,859
involved in how your Python got to where

00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:14,819
it is today because I was the founder of

00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:19,160
the European society and I influenced

00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:24,329
the decision to go to San to Vilnius to

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:28,949
Britain and to Italy and we had an idea

00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:31,349
of why we were doing this each time we

00:38:28,949 --> 00:38:35,729
went to Vilnius because we want to

00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:39,689
spread Python in his Europe we need a

00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:43,079
vision in what we do it and it's not

00:38:39,689 --> 00:38:46,199
enough just to think about what are we

00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:51,109
going to do next year we have to think

00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:53,640
about what direction do we want to take

00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:57,390
something I see as a problem right now

00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:03,229
is that I find many of the talks rather

00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:06,280
boring there are no really new

00:39:03,229 --> 00:39:08,590
inspirational talks at your Python this

00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:16,690
here and I think that's something we

00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:25,450
need to address yeah I agree I mean we

00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:28,300
need to do this as well but yes sorry no

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:33,870
no I it's an opinion it i fully agree

00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:38,890
fully agree and but I I also think that

00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:46,150
this vision should be shared with more

00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:49,480
people this year was a tanky here and I

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:54,700
think that we need to build something

00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:58,990
that is more than a group of people in

00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:02,110
is a more engaged community that drives

00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:06,250
those decisions drive those visions it's

00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:09,610
it's it's a hard problem it's easy to

00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:13,840
just take for granted that it's going to

00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:16,950
be in New Year vital next year and it

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:21,250
would like that it would be like not

00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:25,870
obvious but this vision is much more

00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:28,720
open and we have a lot of people vibrant

00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:31,210
people from Eastern Europe and that

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,730
means that we would like to have more

00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:35,440
teams proposing from Eastern Europe we

00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,750
would like to have more work group

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,600
members for from that part that region

00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:43,060
of Europe so that's part of the plea the

00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:45,700
plan that we are trying to bring and I

00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:48,330
think we are run ok let's start with a

00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,330
