Ever feel like your open source project could be better tested? Lack
of tests holding you back from contributors but you don’t know where
to start? You’re not alone.

[“Adopt pytest month”][1] was held in April 2015. [Pytest][2] volunteers were paired with open source software projects, to find a path to better testing with pytest. Projects varied from  libraries/command line utilities, to a browser, to a complex Django app. In some cases converting existing tests was necessary, in others writing the first tests in existence for non-trivial amounts of code. Two projects were open sourced specifically to take part in “adopt pytest month”. What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer’s perspective to veteran contributors.

This talk will discuss what worked well with “adopt pytest month”,
what didn’t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away
for your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or
an improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and
pytest will be useful.
