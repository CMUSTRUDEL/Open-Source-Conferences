	Brianna Laugher - The realities of open source testing: lessons learned from “Adopt pytest month”

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Ever feel like your open source project could be better tested? Lack
of tests holding you back from contributors but you don’t know where
to start? You’re not alone.

[“Adopt pytest month”][1] was held in April 2015. [Pytest][2] volunteers were paired with open source software projects, to find a path to better testing with pytest. Projects varied from  libraries/command line utilities, to a browser, to a complex Django app. In some cases converting existing tests was necessary, in others writing the first tests in existence for non-trivial amounts of code. Two projects were open sourced specifically to take part in “adopt pytest month”. What began as an experiment in increasing software audience proved to be an interesting exercise in strengthening community and most valuable of all, provided a newcomer’s perspective to veteran contributors.

This talk will discuss what worked well with “adopt pytest month”,
what didn’t, what we learned about pytest and what you could take away
for your open source project, be it an improved testing environment or
an improved contributor community. A basic knowledge of testing and
pytest will be useful.

hi everyone welcome thank you for coming

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:12,780
and now before I get started who here

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,300
was actually involved with adopt by test

00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:20,270
month all right so most of my little

00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:23,670
adult parties mouth cruise over here and

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,269
who here is a contributor to an open

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:32,809
source project one or more all right so

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:35,250
nearly everyone great so it probably

00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:38,160
won't surprise you to know that I love

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,440
pie test I've been a pie test user for a

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,160
few years I've contributed a few patches

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,969
and I generally find it a total joy to

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,039
use and it was folded founded by holger

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:54,629
crackle who gave this morning's keynote

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:57,420
has been around since 2009 it's a very

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:01,829
mature stable project full of features

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:07,380
and has around 170 plugins to match all

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:09,840
kinds of frameworks and so in January at

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,780
the FA's dem conference in Brussels we

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,259
had a little pie test meet up and it was

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,020
lots of fun we got to talk about all

00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:22,439
kinds of things we were excited about

00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,229
doing or fixing in pie tests and I

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:29,159
thought to myself why doesn't everyone

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:32,490
use PI tests like there's some libraries

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,950
for example requests everywhere everyone

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,770
uses requests and everyone says just use

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,650
requests but that's not really the case

00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,649
with pie test it has many many fans and

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,509
many people strongly recommend it but

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,570
it's not really in the situation that

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,079
people say just use PI tests end of

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:56,880
story I mean we even heard even Guido

00:01:52,079 --> 00:02:00,000
you know sticks with the unit test so

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,829
why doesn't everyone use PI chest well

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,729
there's a few reasons that I can think

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:08,580
of and some of them are out of our

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,540
control we will never be able to satisfy

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,130
them but there are some that the PI test

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,750
commune

00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,940
the party's contributors could do

00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:22,040
something about to encourage more people

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:25,040
to use by chest so at fuzzed am I had

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,580
this idea that we could pair up

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,870
open-source maintainer 'he's who were

00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,480
interested in getting started with

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,660
lightest we've experienced high test

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,630
users or developers and they could work

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,390
together for a limited period so there's

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:43,700
not too much of a commitment to help

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:46,190
them really get started and get off on

00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,890
the right foot with pie test and that

00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:50,540
would help overcome knowing where to

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:53,240
start knowing if you're doing it right

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,630
and really taking advantage of all the

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,430
the best features of pie test and with

00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,460
any luck at the end of a month we'd have

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:06,620
a host of new pie test users which would

00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:09,830
be great I decided to organize it for

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:12,200
April and so I wrote up a page on the

00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:15,230
pie test website describing what we were

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,160
planning and I made some surveys to sign

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:22,790
up the pie test helpers and also the

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,920
open-source maintainer and first I tried

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:27,260
to sign up the tightest helpers because

00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,140
I saw it too well if we are inundated

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,760
with open source projects we want to

00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,820
make sure that we have helpers for

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,340
everybody and so I asked the tightest

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,050
helpers what was their experience they

00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,760
didn't have to be a pie test developer

00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,220
so they did not have to have contributed

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,090
code to playtest but they had to feel

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:49,100
that they were experienced a new you

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,260
know most of the most important features

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:53,450
of lightest and I asked them about their

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:56,240
experience with other areas of Python

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,400
programming like frameworks like Django

00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,560
or pyramid or scientific programming so

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:04,870
that I could try to pair people with

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:09,230
appropriate interests and experience and

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:11,330
we had 26 tightest helpers sign up which

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,300
was a lot more than I was actually

00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:17,120
expecting you saw at the pie test been

00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:20,630
up there was six of us in at positive

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,300
and so I was really surprised we had 26

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:26,330
people volunteered to help other people

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,900
learn pie test and only nine of those

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:28,970
people

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,630
were people who had actually contributed

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:36,620
to contributed code to possess before so

00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:42,680
I'd found 15 new people who were keen to

00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:44,780
advocate for pi test and then next I

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,990
tried to sign up the open source

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:49,520
projects I wanted to reach open source

00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,889
projects that were fairly well

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
established and so initially we had a

00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:57,139
requirement that they should have more

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,240
than one core contributor and after a

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:02,270
couple of weeks we do not have many sign

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,250
ups and we thought okay maybe we can

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:09,139
relax this requirement and so projects

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,620
was just one contributor that's fine as

00:05:09,139 --> 00:05:14,570
well and the main way that projects

00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,910
actually found out about a job by test

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,870
months and took part in it is by being

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,449
approached by PI test users so we asked

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,580
the playtest community to look at other

00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,060
projects that they were part of or aware

00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,949
of and maybe ask them on their github

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,539
issues or on their mailing list if they

00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:36,349
would be interested in taking part in

00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:38,599
adopt pi chest much and that was by far

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:43,970
the most effective way to find people

00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:46,370
who were interested to take part and in

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,169
the end we had eight projects that kind

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,419
of officially took part in adopter

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:53,180
parties month and there was another for

00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:55,880
that kind of informally took part in

00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,010
that they said yeah sure if you send me

00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,930
a pull request I'll accept it but they

00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,360
were not really committed to kind of

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:06,860
working closely with the podcast helper

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:09,229
and so the projects we had were by

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,590
 which is a library which has

00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:14,750
provides a bidirectional dictionary

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:17,270
guess it is a command-line utility to

00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:20,780
extract information from media file

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,389
names calathea is a source code

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:26,440
management system similar to get lab

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:29,300
which supports both git and mercurial

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,199
cute browser is a keyboard driven

00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:37,070
browser based on pi qt5 that you can

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,129
control in a similar way to rim Trump is

00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,139
a framework built on pandas

00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:44,679
that aims to centralize the management

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,779
of data feeds Kestra is an extension to

00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:50,080
django that provides semantic web

00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:51,759
publishing and is used by a bunch of

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,409
organizations including the recent

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,449
django con in the UK Nefertari is a REST

00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:02,589
API framework sitting on top of pyramid

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:04,839
and elasticsearch and Coursera DL is a

00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:08,830
command-line utility for downloading

00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:11,349
coursera.org videos and Trump and

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:13,809
Nefertari were both open sourced by

00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:16,119
different companies specifically in

00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:18,300
order to take advantage of adopt by test

00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:20,559
month so there are companies that were

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,529
thinking about open sourcing their

00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:26,080
project or planning to eventually do

00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,939
that but adopt fighters month was really

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,199
the the trigger for them to actually do

00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:34,809
it and informally we had Jason Pickel

00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,259
cookie-cutter django ginger 2 and

00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:42,849
pelican and the last three actually

00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:46,629
accepted pull requests before April even

00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:49,869
began so they kind of as well as said it

00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:53,529
informally took part they did benefit

00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:55,300
and pie test did benefit from contacting

00:07:53,529 --> 00:08:00,459
them but they did not really work

00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:02,589
through the month and so given that

00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:04,659
every project would be in a different

00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:07,029
place with regards to their testing I

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,999
left it up to the pie chest helper and

00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:11,649
the maintainer themselves to decide what

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,240
activities would be appropriate what

00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:15,249
would they how much would they try to

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,569
get done during the month but I just

00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:21,429
suggested to work in incremental steps

00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:23,319
that built on each other rather than

00:08:21,429 --> 00:08:26,679
trying to change everything in one big

00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:29,079
bang and to do lots and lots of code

00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:32,349
reviews like very intensive code reviews

00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:36,069
and to spend a lot of time just talking

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,750
about the the PI test features and kind

00:08:36,069 --> 00:08:40,810
of wondering out loud is this possible

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,269
can you do this and having an

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:46,990
opportunity to to learn through

00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:49,959
discussion and so after the month was

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,010
over i sent a survey up to all the

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:58,220
participants to ask them what

00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:01,200
did and how did it go so the protest

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,500
helpers did things of course like

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,090
updating tests changing unit tests 30

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,300
cool statements to plain assert

00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:13,380
statements and changing the layout of

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,850
code and tests and Doc's too well I'm

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,730
not sure if that was for practice or

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,620
just kind of incidental clean up

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,020
removing boilerplate code that they

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,490
didn't need any more fixing minor bugs

00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,150
that they actually discovered through

00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:30,540
this process converting tests tests to

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:33,300
use parameterize making custom fixtures

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:40,130
make custom markers and introducing the

00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:42,300
use of various pi test plugins and so

00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,690
self-reported I asked them how much time

00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,480
did you spend on adopt plate s month

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:51,000
initially I advised maybe two to four

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,100
hours a week was the time commitment not

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,520
really knowing if it was a lot of time

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,560
or not very much time and really varied

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,160
I'm not really sure how accurate these

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,720
numbers are because estimating you know

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,810
remembering back how much time you spent

00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:11,430
can be quite difficult but five of the

00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,740
pie testers said they would definitely

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,660
take part in it again five said they

00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:18,330
might take part and one person said they

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,340
probably would not and I asked them how

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:24,060
do you feel about the part s community

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:26,100
now after the month and five said they

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,470
were more positive and keen to be

00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,970
involved in the community and five said

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,920
they'll have a similar level of

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:35,730
commitment which might already be quite

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,560
high in fairness and they also reported

00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,120
learning about different features of Pi

00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:42,810
tests that they hadn't been exposed to

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,710
before from various plugins to how to

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:48,510
run doc tests how to support pie tests

00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:51,840
in various continuous continuous

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:54,420
integration servers and more about pie

00:10:51,840 --> 00:11:00,360
tests support for unit tests and nose

00:10:54,420 --> 00:11:02,450
test Suites and then I asked the

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,240
maintenance to tell me what they did and

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:08,309
of course they

00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:13,800
reported discussing the plans over email

00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:15,680
or chat one project used a gator chat

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,720
room which is built on top of github

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,220
others used email or just the issue

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,519
required issue tracker in github itself

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:29,069
they wrote new tests and put pull

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:32,999
requests for the pie test helpers to

00:11:29,069 --> 00:11:35,399
give them feedback and the one

00:11:32,999 --> 00:11:40,040
enterprising maintainer actually updated

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:43,350
a part as plug-in to work with qt5 and

00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,869
one project Coursera dl made a pie pie

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,550
release for the first time so it's a

00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:51,540
very Coursera deal is actually a very

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:53,819
popular project but the the number of

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:57,230
users is not proportional to the number

00:11:53,819 --> 00:12:02,069
of contributors which is not uncommon

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:03,749
and the maintain is in one case 80 hours

00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:08,819
I thought it's really going above and

00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:11,790
beyond and that time varied a lot so

00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:15,360
five maintained is responded others did

00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,399
not respond to my survey and four of

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,230
them said they were definitely or they

00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:21,300
would recommend taking part in adopt pie

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,540
test month to other open source projects

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:26,999
one said maybe and they reported that

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,370
how they felt about pie test now that

00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:30,959
they had a good grasp of the basics but

00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,559
they were also aware that there was

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:38,670
really a lot more that they could learn

00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:41,879
and they they felt very positive about

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:43,829
pie test actually and they all indicated

00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:46,589
that they're going to keep using pi test

00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,689
in their project and two of them told me

00:12:46,589 --> 00:12:50,339
that they have actually introduced pi

00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:52,799
test in other projects that they

00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:55,920
contribute to which i think is really

00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:58,259
cool so even though we directly only

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,689
worked with eight projects because many

00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:02,819
open-source contributors work in

00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:08,970
multiple projects we have a multiplier

00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:11,069
effect and in general the people who

00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,350
responded to me told me that they really

00:13:11,069 --> 00:13:17,549
enjoyed it and they were really grateful

00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:18,100
for the opportunity and so maybe some

00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:20,009
who didn't

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,240
player didn't have such a good time

00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:28,480
which is not a surprise that they didn't

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:30,370
fill out the survey and but just based

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,750
on my observations of looking at the

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:36,220
activity in the various projects of

00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:39,490
course they were not all run away

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:40,870
successes so this is my observations

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,740
about some of the areas where people

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:46,389
struggled and they're not really

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,850
surprising they're the kind of problems

00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:51,339
that we face in open source in general

00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,720
all the time so you get excited about

00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:55,180
something you think you're going to

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,880
devote a lot of time to it but real life

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:04,930
intervenes and you end up not being able

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:08,350
to do anything so some pie test helpers

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:09,699
didn't really show up and I mean I knew

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:13,240
nothing about them except they have

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:14,740
completed a survey for me and some of

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,870
them showed up but we're not really able

00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,790
to make much progress in their project

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,410
and some of the maintainer 'he's were

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:27,000
extremely busy and we're not really able

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:30,189
to work with their helpers either so i

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,779
wanted to think about what are some

00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:34,660
things that we've learned from this that

00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:36,310
if we do it again we could take into

00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,399
account to try to have a better

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:43,300
experience for everyone because even

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:46,589
though i told everyone you know it's all

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,850
volunteers and we hope that it works out

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,110
people were very understanding but at

00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,939
the same time it's kind of disappointing

00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,800
if you think you're going to work with

00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:55,959
somebody but then they don't actually

00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,089
show up or you don't get done what you

00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,310
wanted to get done so how can we have

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:05,500
realistic expectations about what we're

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:07,360
doing so the first thing I learned is

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:11,199
that you don't really know how many

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:13,750
people are lurking in your community so

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,819
for those of us who are experienced in

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,370
open source we kind of know that the way

00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:21,310
to get into it is to just march right in

00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:24,699
sit right down start working on

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:26,980
something submit a pull request and

00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:29,410
that's fine that's actually the way it

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,750
works but when you are outside the

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,580
circle it's not very clear how do you

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:37,440
how do you get in how do you start and

00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:40,570
it's kind of intimidating so giving a

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,890
foothold to people to say this is the

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,530
thing that you could do and this is like

00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:48,280
a very clear expectation about how you

00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:51,190
take part in this activity was a really

00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,490
helpful thing to do and one of the

00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:56,140
parties helpers said this they said that

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,420
it was the first time they contributed

00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:01,870
code to someone else's open source

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,270
project so i think that's super cool we

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:07,930
were able to bring someone inside the

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:10,240
circle and to me this was a really

00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,180
important revelation of doing adopt pi

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,580
test month that there's a lot of value

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,550
in making a space for users to be

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,920
advocates of your software so by

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:22,930
advocates I mean people who are excited

00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,750
about bringing other people on board to

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:29,050
your project they don't have to be

00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:32,460
contributing code in companies they

00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:34,870
often have positions called evangelists

00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,000
developer evangelists they'll come and

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,470
you know give talks that conferences and

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,820
tell you how great this library is that

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:44,410
you should totally use and in open

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:47,740
source projects that are not corporate

00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,830
fact or company backed that's usually

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,250
left to the developers but there's real

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:56,400
value in recognizing the work of

00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:59,530
advocates in our open source projects

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,890
it's not only good for the community but

00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:06,939
it's good for the users of your software

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:09,400
and so the third thing is that code

00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:13,120
review is maybe not just important but

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,310
actually amazing so I called my talk the

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,310
realities of open-source testing and

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:21,520
this is actually what I'm talking about

00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:23,860
because the majority of open-source

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,650
projects probably the median number of

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,630
contributors is one so there's a real

00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,250
long tailed distribution of open-source

00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:32,200
projects and at the head we've got

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,850
really popular projects like python

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:42,580
django even pi test is fairly far up the

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:44,890
the head of the graph but there's just

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,870
this long tail of

00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:49,480
the projects that have one contributor

00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:53,500
and even a popular project like Coursera

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:59,020
dl I mentioned only has one person who's

00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:01,330
really developing code so for them is

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:03,400
incredibly valuable to have someone

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,430
reading their code engaging with it and

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:08,410
able to give them specialized advice

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:11,020
about the way they're using a particular

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,550
library and the testing library is

00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,310
something that you really rely heavily

00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,830
on your test code might be forty percent

00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,180
of your whole code base so you really

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:22,470
want to make sure that you're getting

00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:25,390
the most out of it i mean the the

00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:29,320
parameterize marker in my test is a good

00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,720
example of that you can easily write

00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,660
very repetitive tests without realizing

00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:37,530
that it even exists but if someone tells

00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:42,040
you hey is this exists you can condense

00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:48,040
500 lines into 50 lines that will just

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:50,290
blow your way and so the last thing is

00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,840
that something I really underestimated

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,330
is that this kind of project I was

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,400
thinking a lot about how we are teaching

00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,430
or mentoring the open-source maintainer

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,400
about PI test but it was really also a

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:05,050
case that for each helper they were they

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,520
would need to be mentored or on border

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:11,170
on to their specific partner project and

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,890
I didn't really emphasize this to the

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,810
project maintain errs of course in

00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,610
hindsight I can say of course it makes

00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:21,010
sense that you need to understand the

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:23,680
domain of this piece of software the

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,990
concepts and the functionality most of

00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,960
all before you can effectively test it

00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:32,050
and you need to have the documentation

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,350
in place to support all that and which

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:38,950
is more than just having docstrings so

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:43,360
this is something that I would be aware

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:45,340
of if I was to do this again and so my

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,190
question to to the open-source

00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:50,860
maintainer Xin the room is can you make

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,020
a space for advocates in your project or

00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,720
do you recognize the work that advocates

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,930
are doing in your project and could you

00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,450
offer a kind of

00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:03,620
targeted code review program to two

00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:05,480
users of your library and if you were

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:09,680
interested in doing something like that

00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,360
this is a few suggestions and something

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,080
important is that you don't necessarily

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,940
need to do this with new users as we did

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,550
with adopt pi test month it would

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,820
actually work probably even better with

00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:27,680
existing users just helping them really

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:29,600
make the most of using the library and i

00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,850
put here you encourage people to say

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,270
sorry i haven't done that yet or i'm not

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:38,210
sure where to start and i think it's

00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:41,330
very common that when we are blocked and

00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:43,070
or if we procrastinate and we don't

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:45,980
finish something that we told someone we

00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:47,570
would do and they write an email and

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,030
they're like hey has that thing coming

00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,100
along it's kind of it's very hard to

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,080
reply and say yeah i haven't done that

00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,720
yet and it's much easier to just kind of

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,110
ignore the email and then another week

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,960
goes by and it's a real loss of time in

00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,650
a in a short period of a project like

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,810
this which only runs for one month so

00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:11,480
making it much trying to tell people

00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,130
it's really okay to say either i haven't

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,860
done that yet or i don't know where to

00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:18,770
start would help to overcome some of

00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:21,650
those communication barriers or uneven

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:24,110
contributions and i think it's really

00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:26,120
important to recognize your advocates

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,800
and try to recognize people who are

00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,700
doing work in your project that are not

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:34,550
that's not contributing code so

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:37,390
something important for me was i made

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:40,040
the point of writing linkedin

00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,880
recommendations for the advocates as a

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,130
way of acknowledging that they done

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,580
really good really valuable and really

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:51,080
important work for pi test and

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:55,240
definitely don't schedule it in the same

00:21:51,080 --> 00:22:02,270
month as pike on us which is what i did

00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:04,679
take note so to conclude it was a very

00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:07,889
interesting experiment

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,809
I think it's been really exciting to

00:22:07,889 --> 00:22:15,860
meet some of the people who took part in

00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:19,529
it here at euro python and one of our

00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:21,299
project maintain errs actually delivered

00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:25,499
the pie test training that we had on

00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:29,220
Monday so in the space of less than two

00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:31,309
months he's gone from not knowing or not

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,960
really knowing pie test at all to

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,169
delivering training on it and updating

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,059
plugins and all kinds of things so i

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:42,149
think it was really valuable and

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:44,850
interesting positive experience for pi

00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:46,499
test and i'd encourage other projects to

00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,429
think about if it is something that they

00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:52,769
could do in some way and so thank you

00:22:50,429 --> 00:22:54,419
very much to the the PI test

00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:57,659
contributors who kind of supported

00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:59,369
trying this in the first place as well

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,950
as the the helpers and the project

00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:03,480
maintain errs who had a lot of patience

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,070
as we were kind of trying this thing and

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,820
we're not really sure how it was going

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:11,940
to work and I just wanted to mention

00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:15,690
that tomorrow there are two talks from

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:17,940
the two pi test helpers and talking

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,629
about slightly related things and

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,970
there's more information including a PDF

00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:26,580
report about part test month in case you

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:31,940
want to get all the details about it at

00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,940
those addresses so thank you

00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:43,840
we have a minute or two for one or two

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,840
questions if there are any

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,390
well first of all thanks a lot I'm one

00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:02,240
of those guys who do use my test but I

00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,980
don't contribute sorry but again thanks

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,620
a lot that's just inspiring when

00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:08,000
question is how do you feel about the

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:11,450
effort that could be spent on

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,120
advertising a product especially at the

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:17,179
library through social media for example

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:19,160
if i search twitter for pi test i got

00:24:17,179 --> 00:24:22,010
twitter that org with not as many

00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:25,040
followers and so on so do you feel that

00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:27,080
is important to maintain such a channel

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,770
is Twitter Facebook and so on for

00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:34,490
developers or github is just enough

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:36,919
thanks I haven't thought about if it's

00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:39,410
important in general but I started the

00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,990
party store tour Twitter account about

00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:45,230
the time that we started thinking about

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:47,929
adopt by test month and I tried to use

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:52,179
it to advertise the concept on Twitter

00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:55,100
which worked okay but actually something

00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:58,760
really great about the Twitter account

00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:01,010
is that many people just post tweets

00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,990
saying about how much they love pie test

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:05,299
or they're like giving a talk about pie

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,429
test at their user group that we had no

00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:11,660
idea about like there's talks been given

00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:15,410
in Portuguese Japanese Thai all around

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:17,450
the world and just having a like a

00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,760
search set up for any mention of pie

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:23,540
test has revealed all these things to me

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,000
and which is really really it's so nice

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,520
to see that people love something that

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,140
you are part of and we had a meeting

00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:34,309
yesterday we're actually talking about

00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:37,970
setting up a blog to gather that kind of

00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:39,770
information as well so I don't know if I

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,580
would say it's essential but I think

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:45,620
it's a positive thing and I think having

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:49,179
a blog where we can post links to

00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:51,970
tutorials and things will also help

00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:54,679
users to see that it's there is a

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:55,820
vibrant community around pie chest and I

00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,710
think that's something that people take

00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,350
into account when they are evaluating

00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:02,150
whether to use a library or not it's

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,620
good to be able to show that you have a

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:05,180
lot of users you have people who are

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,960
keen to help you if you

00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:10,310
need help okay I'm afraid right of time

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,550
now but thank you very much Brianna

00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,550
