	Andreas Kaiser - Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: The Kotti Web Application Framework
[EuroPython 2015]

[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Kotti is a high-level, Pythonic web application framework based on
Pyramid, SQLAlchemy and Bootstrap 3.  It includes an extensible
Content Management System called the Kotti CMS.  Kotti is particularly
well suited for building custom applications with object level
security.  It comes with complete user and group management and
supports the concepts of global and local roles providing management
views for each of those.

The talk will give an overview on Kotti, its philosophy, history and
future. Target audience are people who want to learn what it is and
can be used for.  Because Kotti is just a rather small layer on top of
its foundations, the talk might also give some interesting insights on
how to build a solid (web) framework that suits your personal
preferences.
