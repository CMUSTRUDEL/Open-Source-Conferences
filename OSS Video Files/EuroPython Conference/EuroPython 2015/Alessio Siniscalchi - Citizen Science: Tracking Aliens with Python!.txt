Description: 
	Alessio Siniscalchi - Citizen Science: Tracking Aliens with Python!
[EuroPython 2015]
[21 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

The talk discusses the challenges of implementing a Citizen Science
Paradigm in a Python-centric platform, and the solutions devised for
the System for observation and monitoring of Marine Alien Species,
currently used by the italian Institute for Environmental Protection
and Research (ISPRA). "Alien" Species means species introduced into a
natural environment where they are not normally found.

Topics includes strategies for crowd-friendly forms, work-flow
definition for collected data, choice of the best technologies for its
components: app for android devices, web application for citizens and
experts, webGIS for data browsing and web services for data exporting.

thank you welcome everybody to my talk I

00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:15,680
told them the tracking audience with

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:19,350
pattern and citizen science application

00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:22,740
shortly I introduced myself and company

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,670
working i'm a lazy asinus cal king metal

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:31,380
engineer and I work in room and my

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:36,480
company is the open solutions from Rome

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:40,950
Italy and we use the mission and

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:43,440
philosophy or our company easy to use

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:49,760
open source software as much as possible

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:54,559
as for italian companies or four large

00:00:49,760 --> 00:01:02,100
industries and international institutes

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:05,369
ok one or of our main subject is

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:09,299
reentered to develop geographical data

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:16,520
such as environmental data and image

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:19,830
recognition and image plotting and so on

00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,729
ok my contact information is displayed

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,299
here and for you all at the end my talk

00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:29,640
but welker is about audience I don't

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:38,970
know if you read the abstract on my talk

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:42,659
and this is a little question for I

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:47,130
think the big question definitive

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,070
question for we all is are we alone can

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:55,229
we collect and enhancing the instruments

00:01:50,070 --> 00:02:00,540
track aliens unknown fine object and so

00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:04,920
on ok no of course not I'm join with you

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:09,720
and I we are not talking about margins

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,640
of course we are talking about a system

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,790
to

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,360
register to collect data about marine

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:22,320
alien species marine alien species that

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,590
is to say a species are not invasive the

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:29,700
non autochthonous so of course we are

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:32,670
not alone and the stakeholders of this

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,140
kind of application is not a telescope

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:42,240
operators or radio amateurs but is the

00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:46,200
scientists marine biologists and then of

00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:52,170
course citizens divers professional and

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:55,170
non-professional fishermen ok now we

00:02:52,170 --> 00:03:00,030
speak about this application the

00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:03,900
importance of to register to collect

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:08,420
data about alien that is to say

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:14,300
non-indigenous species marine species

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:17,910
why because they the presence of these

00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:20,420
invasive species is one of the major

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:24,450
cases of the decrease it a biodiversity

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:30,090
so not only the pollution of the sea we

00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:34,290
consider I underline that we don't speak

00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:41,160
strictly about fish but only jelly fish

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:45,660
crustaceans and living sea plants and so

00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:50,610
on you can see in this picture one fish

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:54,620
with three eyes and picture the near the

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:58,020
coast of Springfield the USA okay and

00:03:54,620 --> 00:04:00,290
but how the travel that you have a line

00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,740
the ballast waters of commercial ships

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:06,130
or die

00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:09,970
we have an additional intentional human

00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:14,130
introduction of this fish annotation for

00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:19,450
example from aquariums also intentional

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:22,630
introduction to balance the day update

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:28,750
of these pieces of course marine

00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:34,630
biologists do this introduction but they

00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:39,670
should be strongly monitored okay when a

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:42,340
marine species is interacted in the in a

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,330
new habitat they began to multiply their

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,850
presence increase in predation and

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:53,070
competition so consuming system

00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:56,770
resources and so change a diaper change

00:04:53,070 --> 00:05:03,130
of the habitat change the species itself

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:08,170
the DNA we know so we have this is a

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:14,130
very important question so and what this

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:21,330
kind of problem and deal with Python

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:25,290
okay this is some characteristic of this

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:29,740
this kind of problems are very typical

00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:34,030
we consider in this case geographical

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:37,720
data geo-located data and of course you

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:42,700
know that scientist the dream of each

00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:49,870
scientist and to have a wide very wide

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:55,030
area collected the recollection of of

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:59,970
that in magennis way but of course it is

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:06,960
not always possible you know that

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:10,540
resources are very scarce and also

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,950
scientists are few and they were

00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:19,030
curr is expensive I don't know here but

00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:23,470
in Italy we have a few resources few

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:27,430
refunds for researchers so a rapid

00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:31,240
usually Rapids are very few they are

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:36,010
accused the ball in the most populated

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:40,120
areas on the most interesting ones from

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:46,150
the point of view of the environmental

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:49,900
habitat and biodiversity and so this is

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:54,880
in this picture we see a case of this

00:06:49,900 --> 00:07:01,890
shell the designation of this channel is

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:09,300
around the Venice lagoon above all so so

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:14,140
the the records are very few and what

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:16,780
the solution of this kind of problem is

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:20,580
the application of the citizen science /

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:24,490
dime what is the citizen science / dime

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:28,020
SI the citizen science means public

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:35,490
participation in scientific research and

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:42,820
this is a Wikipedia definition it is one

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:45,760
century years old so and what what it

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:49,090
needs in my opinion of course to be

00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:54,150
applicable the it needs the supervision

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:59,440
of a professional scientists why because

00:07:54,150 --> 00:08:04,180
we cannot consider the the collected

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:09,930
data from non-professional user citizens

00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:14,290
are known professional scientist as good

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:19,690
so we have a first phase to validate

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:24,190
data collected then of course we have to

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:29,400
do a survey over this collected data

00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:36,280
and at the end of this survey we have

00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:40,630
the need of a person scientists that

00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:45,040
have the has the responsibility to

00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:47,490
publish the survey so import we need a

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,130
work for the definition of a work flow

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,110
of course non-professional you sure that

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:59,860
should be emotionally involved in the

00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:08,590
project and so we need to give them

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:13,000
feedback Sam and in okay some some

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:16,950
information that should be important to

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:23,410
the public participation is that a day

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:28,450
it should involve a public important

00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:31,840
issue so also users should not be

00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:37,390
scarred by long forms long subscribing

00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:42,310
procedures complicated work so they they

00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:46,870
should compile user-friendly forms we

00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:53,070
have to balance to need they need to

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:58,750
have a lot of data but poor poor

00:09:53,070 --> 00:10:01,570
information over each report with with a

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:08,050
lot of information on each record but

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:12,280
very few records and we prefer to have a

00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:16,839
lot of records but each record should

00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:22,210
have very very few information and so we

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:26,650
have we need to to have homogeneous that

00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:31,930
and a wide area of course cited cited

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:35,440
citizen science paradigm in nowadays is

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:39,580
used because

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:42,670
there is a big diffusion of media

00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:45,340
devices of course users should be akibat

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:53,740
with tools for the rapper tava of the

00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:59,380
observations so and we we can we can use

00:10:53,740 --> 00:11:07,500
this kind of paradigm and these are some

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:14,740
example of citizen science project

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:20,170
project and some success stories and not

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:22,390
only environmental projects they involve

00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:26,010
oh for example this one from the

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:30,820
National Geographic they they send you a

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:34,230
little kid to get your DNA for tracking

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:39,310
history of human migrations for example

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:43,420
okay now I speak in general now I am

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:46,630
going to speak the most specific keys of

00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:51,160
my project s ma system for tracking

00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:54,940
marine aliens the client defiant client

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:59,350
was is bruh is brad is the Italian

00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:07,830
Institute for environmental protection

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:11,070
and research and this is the main

00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:19,750
infrastructure system infrastructure a

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:25,930
we see on the left the input data input

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:30,060
data it's coming from a anonymous user

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:33,339
or authenticated user via a facebook

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:39,190
authentication facebook authentication

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:43,720
API is defined in facebook it is not

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:48,470
such complicated work of course feedback

00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:52,810
can be applicable only for facebook

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:57,980
log at the users and then it is the

00:12:52,810 --> 00:13:04,030
html5 forms to be visible line a major

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:09,770
device with a webview webview plum

00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:14,540
instance we see that we have to plan

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:20,510
instances one lone instances is designed

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:25,970
to be to be visualized by media devices

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:32,680
and the second one for desktop for

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:39,560
desktop work workplaces so we need we

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:46,490
see that this kind of project have three

00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:51,230
databases note that I have marked two

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:55,480
different colors pink for developed

00:13:51,230 --> 00:14:01,130
software and light green for only

00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:08,450
configured software that that is tarah

00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:15,220
available so what what about database so

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:21,950
DB you know is the euro are colored soup

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:25,490
database i I don't I don't want to speak

00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:30,610
about this I design a postgres with

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:37,210
postgis extensions to collect data and

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:44,960
and also a file system to collect the

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:49,540
pictures for all of the species for a

00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:54,970
local the bees of marine species and for

00:14:49,540 --> 00:15:01,059
signal ations of marine species and

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:06,039
these i split the work in

00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:14,019
two part of course pictures egg

00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:22,289
Malaysian are the biggest four sides so

00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:28,349
I need to consider a project scalable

00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:32,979
because you can't predict in advance in

00:15:28,349 --> 00:15:38,639
for citizen science application you

00:15:32,979 --> 00:15:41,469
don't you don't know in advance the the

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,549
participation the amount of the

00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:50,289
participation of citizens so with the

00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:55,389
file system storing you can add space

00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:58,149
storage space simply mounting new parts

00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:03,639
of the file system of course this

00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:09,969
project ever openlayers openlayers used

00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:17,319
the for users for in the blown instances

00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:21,609
boat but one on the left is used to mark

00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:26,399
the position of designations and second

00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:30,549
one on the right used to manage all

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:35,379
designations by bio marine experts of

00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:42,729
course and at the end we have on right

00:16:35,379 --> 00:16:48,329
the interfaces to use such data for by

00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:52,019
external services so we have an XML or

00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:58,559
CSV exporter and the Joe server

00:16:52,019 --> 00:17:05,259
instances to make data available with

00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:09,839
very famous protocols such as wfs ok

00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:13,600
this is the simply crowd friendly form

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:14,439
to make a signal ation you see the top

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,169
on the

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:22,799
Stan the bottom on the right you see

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:27,240
that it's only one page one plum page

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:30,580
one language one one layer on the map

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:35,799
it's very simple should be very simple

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:43,330
with very few information only picture

00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:49,059
and position our compulsory and so we

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:52,769
have other dotted report is the date of

00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:55,529
the observations depth and some

00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:58,139
additional notes so there is a

00:17:55,529 --> 00:18:02,860
validation a type of validation

00:17:58,139 --> 00:18:09,429
client-side and after of course there is

00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:16,029
a validation of the expert server side

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:18,070
of course we see the workflow definition

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:20,409
this is an example work for the

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:26,169
definition but it is very typical in

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:30,429
this case studies and we have to kind of

00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:34,090
experts expert level one we call the

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:38,549
level one that made the validation the

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:43,169
creation of the survey and so the

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:47,409
attribution of the right species to

00:18:43,169 --> 00:18:51,659
designations and expert a level two that

00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:58,240
have the responsibility to publish the

00:18:51,659 --> 00:19:02,649
survey anyway signal a shin reacted or

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:05,710
publish add a generates a feedback to

00:19:02,649 --> 00:19:11,500
the citizens so the citizen should be

00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:20,110
involved and should be considered and so

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:24,159
now I quickly show you some fight on ps3

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:27,279
little Python piece use the note that I

00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,179
you spied on non such an eccentric or

00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,610
strange

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:37,769
way but as a general glue to make all

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:42,129
tools working together this one is a

00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:46,720
piece of code from the database model I

00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:50,409
use SQL alchemy declarative base so this

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,289
is the class class signalization you

00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:59,590
know that this with one to one

00:19:53,289 --> 00:20:04,690
relationship with the survey useless is

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:07,649
force then we we know that latitude and

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:11,559
longitude are to float but position is

00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:17,080
easy geometry so I use a jewel alchemy

00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:20,619
two and a simple simple function to make

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:26,159
the translation of the position to be

00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:31,269
used with openlayers another piece is

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:39,039
the it may piece of code for the XML

00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:44,889
exporter it uses chameleon and we have

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:47,860
to translate a ABCD DNA template this is

00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:54,070
a template used for exchange biological

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:57,399
data so it's a I think it's enough

00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:02,470
simple but I translate a page template

00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:06,340
file I fill it with data and third is a

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:09,940
little bit interesting there is a

00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:13,929
connection with the worms worms is the

00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:18,330
word register of marine species the de

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:21,460
facto standard for the taxonomy

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:28,600
definition of marine species so all over

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:35,259
the world we know that worms offers a

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:40,550
service to query it's the base via so

00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:46,100
Apple protocol so I use a saw papai to

00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:51,650
to query this database with this with

00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:58,480
this schema I I reach the possibility to

00:21:51,650 --> 00:22:03,670
have the classification of each species

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:12,110
automatically and so the biologists

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:16,880
scientists should not insert and insert

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:25,540
the rank the filament general of the

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:30,920
species and now man now is available

00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:36,100
momently at this link and it is not

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:45,530
sponsored at the yet but should be

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:50,140
published soon I hope and okay and this

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,140
is the all thank you for listening

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,940
we have time for two questions if anyone

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,660
has a question please raise their hand

00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,660
and we'll get you the microphone

00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:26,160
hi so why did you choose blown to his

00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:31,410
plan okay yes I i choose blown before I

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:37,640
choose blown because the final client

00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:46,080
one of the reasons at the final client

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:50,640
were as is already skillful with blown

00:23:46,080 --> 00:24:02,480
also the aspray institute as a blonde

00:23:50,640 --> 00:24:10,110
side so we didn't have in this project

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:15,660
and after deployment assistance so this

00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:23,340
is the one of the best solution for for

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:26,850
them the client of course also be open

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:31,920
the company working i have a strong know

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:39,030
how about this content management system

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:42,210
so i choose that time for one more if

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:48,990
anyone has one okay thank you very much

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:53,180
alessio thank you your well we'll be

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,180
