Have you ever developed a nice, well-working python program on one
environment, only to have it blow up with exceptions and tracebacks
when you run it on a different environment? Have no fear! This talk
will show you how to write and maintain python code that is compatible
across environments that may differ by python versions and/or
operating systems.

Techniques and tips will be drawn from lessons and experiences gained
from making the AWS CLI, a python-based command line tool to manage
AWS resources, compatible across a wide range of environments. In a
case-study-like format, real-life compatibility issues encountered
while developing the AWS CLI will be presented along with how we
resolved each of them. These real-life examples will encompass, but
will not be limited to, the following topics:

• How to use functions and classes that may differ across python
versions and/or operating systems

• How to handle version-specific bugs

• How to handle strings, bytes, and Unicode across python versions

• How to handle differing locale settings

• How to handle file operations across operating systems

• How and when to vendor dependencies

• How to write tests that are compatible across python versions and
operating systems

• How to create a testing environment that monitors compatibility of
code across various environments

Ultimately, the goal of these examples is introduce to you some
effective, real-world programming practices to overcome your current
or next compatibility issue.
