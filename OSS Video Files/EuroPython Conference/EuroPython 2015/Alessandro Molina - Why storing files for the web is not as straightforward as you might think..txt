DEPOT ( http://depot.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ ) is a file storage
framework born from the experience on a project that saved a lot of
files on disk, until the day it went online and the customer system
engineering team decided to switch to Heroku, which doesn't support
storing files on disk.

The talk will cover the facets of a feature "saving files" which has
always been considered straightforward but that can become complex in
the era of cloud deployment and when infrastructure migration happens.

After exposing the major drawbacks and issues that big projects might
face on short and long terms with file storage the talk will introduce
DEPOT and how it tried to solve most of the issues while providing a
super-easy-to-use interface for developers. We will see how to use
DEPOT to provide attachments on SQLAlchemy or MongoDB and how to
handle problems like migration to a different storage backend and long
term evolution.

Like SQLAlchemy makes possible to switch your storage on the fly
without touching code, DEPOT aims at making so possible for files and
even use multiple different storages together.
