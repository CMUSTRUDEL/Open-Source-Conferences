	Stephan Erb - Release Management with Devpi
[EuroPython 2015]
[22 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Devpi is an open source PyPi-compatible package server. Its versatile
features make it the Swiss Army knife of Python package and release
management, enabling anyone to shape a custom release workflow.

In this talk, I will detail how we use our company-wide Devpi
installation in order to share a large set of packages across teams,
deploy binary packages to our application servers, and mix and mash
open source packages with our own. With Devpi being a critical part of
our release and deployment infrastructure, I will also cover our high-
availability setup and how we perform major version updates with
minimal downtime.

While this talk is not meant to be an exhaustive introduction of all
available Devpi features, it can offer insights on how Devpi can be
used at a larger scale.
