	Alessandro Amici - Solving the web most popular code shortening competition in Python.
[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

“Code shortening” is the “sport” where participants strive to achieve
the shortest possible source code that solves a programming problem by
exploiting all the tricks and quirks of the language.

The [SIZECON on SPOJ][1] is one of the oldest and most popular code
shortening problems on the web with a bizarre twist, only character
above ASCII value 32 are counted for the penalty. During the talk we
will take a journey into some frightening depths of the Python
language in order to write shorter and shorter solutions to SIZECON
until, exploiting a number of truly mind-blowing tricks, we will reach
the current record solution of 28 characters (above ASCII 32!).

I promise I’ll show you the most obfuscated, contrived and sick python
code you have ever seen and (hopefully!) will ever see. I invite
participants to give [SIZECON][1] a try and check their score against
the [Python2][2] and [Python3][3] SPOJ rankings.
