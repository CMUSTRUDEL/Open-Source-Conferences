Users and developers especially, hate waiting. Computing has adapted
and we almost never wait for the computer for more then 10 seconds.
One big exception is runnig a test suite which takes MINUTES on many
projects. That is incredibly distracting, frustrating and dragging the
whole concept of automated tests down.

I present a technique and a tool (py.test plugin called "testmon")
which automatically selects only tests affected by recent changes.
Does it sound too good to be true? Python developers rightfully have a
suspecting attitude towards any tool which tries to be too clever
about their source code. Code completion and symbol searching doesn't
need to be 100% reliable but messing with the test suite execution? I
show that we can cut test suite execution time significantly but
maintain it's reliability.
