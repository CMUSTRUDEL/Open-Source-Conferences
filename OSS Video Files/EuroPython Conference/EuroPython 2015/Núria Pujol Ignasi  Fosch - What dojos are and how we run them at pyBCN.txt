	Núria Pujol/Ignasi  Fosch - What dojos are and how we run them at pyBCN
[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Coding dojos are a very good way to share coding knowledge among
members in a community, and, at the same time, introduce people into
the language and community.
Sometimes, though, the typical approach to set coding dojos may
prevent expert coders to join the session. This is the story of the
pyBCN's dojos, so far.

sister roll a little bit of ass okay

00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,090
just to say that we are not develop that

00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:12,400
we are organizing we are organized as in

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,230
five ecn but not really Python

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,590
developers I'm instrumentation

00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:20,310
engineering physique in Spanish Research

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:28,570
Council and working in marine technology

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:30,369
but I use Python in every way I can I am

00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,940
nasty i am an interesting to engineer

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,700
working at the exit come media site

00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,630
about NGO and international development

00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:43,900
i'm more come and coming more from this

00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:46,690
system administration part of the other

00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:50,110
thing i like to write pram since i was a

00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:53,620
kid so I'm kind of a wannabe developer

00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,800
not not very good we have it worse than

00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,530
than system administrator but trying to

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,720
valentino's by the way if you ever come

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,199
to visit Barcelona or something and you

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,240
can check in by VC anthology about our

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,170
activities or meet ups or religious or

00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:18,370
whatever so if you are around you can

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:20,799
feel free to come and give a salad so

00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,990
we're gonna give a very introductory

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,960
talk and what we have in rings for the

00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:29,140
last nine months one year because we

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:31,049
started with doing some Dodgers is that

00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:37,330
anyone who knows what the cutting DOJ's

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:39,640
right now quite a few we will start with

00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:42,909
a brief story of five Barcelona Dodgers

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,920
how we started doing them how what we

00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:47,229
have been doing a little bit then we

00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,810
will give a small introduction to what

00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:52,360
are cutting the juries and what related

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,640
concepts are with it we will do a small

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,460
recap on the sessions beyond just

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,820
choosing some of them not all because it

00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:03,130
could be quite long then we will take a

00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:05,409
look back on to see what things we learn

00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:08,679
doing Dodgers about what you need to

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,010
prepare what things you need to be aware

00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,220
of and then we talking about the Dodger

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:18,550
sessions we are we are gonna have your

00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:21,670
Adira Python this year and we will is a

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:25,060
very small set of ideas to start with

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:31,950
your community actually it's a pair of

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:34,570
point what pyrazolyl adagio started with

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:38,530
actually we're not related at by fiber

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,790
through on a group before we started

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,720
with a small group of system

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:46,420
administrators people who was interested

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,960
in to learn some programming stuff and

00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:52,300
then we decided to start using Python

00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,480
because it looked like a very low

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:59,440
warrior entry level language easy to

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,720
learn and to start working with and big

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,480
problem we had is that we did very

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,260
infrequent sessions we barely did one

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,390
every two months after having these

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,800
sessions or during having sessions in

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:13,600
another conference we were connecting

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,370
with some papers and our members about

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,739
what we were doing and they were quite

00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:20,050
interesting into setting up these

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,630
sessions for the whole Python national

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,070
community so if then we started running

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:28,510
this essence monthly in a figure

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:31,590
determining the dates every three months

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,810
and having different kinds of sessions

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,420
because we feel we thought that there

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:40,989
were there were a lot of different skill

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,970
levels into the among the people that

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,720
were kind of interested in to having

00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:51,120
them so we are going to talk about what

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,120
have passed for the last nine months

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,670
well for those who doesn't now our

00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:01,300
coding disease as the Hanson session the

00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:03,040
first very important target or goal of

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,140
the sessions is to have fun with code

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,320
colleagues and people with similar

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,130
interests the second is learn from

00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,470
others because usually it comes at

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,540
someone attending that phase yeah i'm

00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,330
very new value i don't know anything or

00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:21,580
deadly use python but there are also

00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,700
other people that master some subjects

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:25,150
on python or even on just the kind of

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,150
our

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,210
we're proposing and for the people who

00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:33,490
knows more about Python or master some

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:35,860
subjects it's to share individual

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,580
individual knowledge this is we get that

00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:44,110
because we try to use several techniques

00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,570
that I'm going to explain later also we

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:50,169
use the coding dodges to practice new

00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:52,900
technical tools which we don't use to do

00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:55,509
them in our daily job for example

00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:01,870
testing or writing writing tests or

00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:04,090
doing TDD or such an then the related

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,669
concepts more important to be aware of

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:10,600
when you are attending or organizing a

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,979
dojo is others of the of here first one

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,530
is the cutter the cata is the trivial

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:17,620
exercise we are going to try we're going

00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:20,229
to state for the sessions for the

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,919
session to complete its trivial because

00:05:20,229 --> 00:05:26,139
it's usually not very difficult and it's

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,120
trivial because it doesn't matter if we

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,900
come to a solution we are not trying to

00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,479
kill cancer or to find anything big and

00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:39,849
it doesn't matter if individually or

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:42,159
within the team we form of we find a

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:44,770
solution what we are trying is to learn

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:49,110
from what others are doing within the

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:51,370
team or with other teams we are gonna we

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,130
usually we use paper ramming also

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:57,580
because this is a very good technique

00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:59,740
especially when you make you use paper

00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:04,240
ramming with TV for example it can be

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:08,169
kind of fun also we do iterative

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,840
development so we when we prepare the

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:13,479
cutter we tend to have some preparation

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,070
before in order to have the steps that

00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,510
are updated iterations we are going to

00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:21,909
have so we can guide people attending

00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,430
these situations are done within a time

00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:28,479
box the structure we use the pomodoro

00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:33,630
technique which is just having 25 to 45

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:38,270
minutes to have every iteration and and

00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:40,610
why yeah we tend to change the times and

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,790
kind of chaotic sometimes but it's

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,950
important to try to enforce these

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,930
techniques also we put a very strong

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,970
emphasis into differentiating testing

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,620
that hostility this doesn't mean that we

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,390
need to write tests for everything this

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:55,610
doesn't mean that we use tdv in all the

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,250
sessions there are some sessions where

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,650
we enforce much more TDD there are some

00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,390
sessions but we only want to see some

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,190
tests to check that everything works and

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,800
even we have some sessions that we are

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:10,340
not even looking at the test in case

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:14,300
they are also on each session after all

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,550
the built in the iterations we have well

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,890
it should be small usually it is not

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:21,260
retrospective session with all the Aten

00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,300
and so people can explain what data they

00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,520
like what they don't like what they

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:28,160
learn and what they are taking off from

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,560
the session so we can learn what we are

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,460
doing good what we are doing by the

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,380
minute to improve or what we should be

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,440
taking care of sometimes it's very

00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,680
serious sometimes it's just format the

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,210
Aiken a condition out of the room or the

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,100
kind of the quality of the projector or

00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,530
something like that but sometimes people

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,140
explains yeah this kind of problem was

00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,930
very nice but we we haven't done

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:56,000
statement before we had understatement

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,040
to check while we were calling things

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,520
like that can be helpful to improve the

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:06,950
sessions so this is his model carbon

00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,610
three of the most cool or interesting

00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:13,490
sessions we had some once at all we had

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,830
the pie test versus unit test session it

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,530
was intended to be a hands-on and pie

00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:21,050
test with comparing with a unit test

00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:24,410
nation on the same cut a very simple and

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:27,380
small one of the big problems we had

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:29,540
with pie test on vs vs Anita session it

00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,760
was that we didn't know some with ian

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:34,910
had so much knowledge of biased we just

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,740
had the very introductory knowledge so

00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:39,890
it was really hard to answer certain

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:42,440
doubts that people get we were trying to

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,920
when we did that session we were trying

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,020
to provide more something more

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,150
interesting for people with some

00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,020
experience that are not so interested in

00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,600
two

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:57,310
starting with TV but running about what

00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,650
they can get from using other tools and

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:03,950
this was one of the other problems we

00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:06,620
had there in the ceiling qm python in

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:09,350
the session which was based on a peter

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,770
hinge and worship at the python 2014

00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:16,730
last year it was quite interesting we

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:20,090
had I think 18 people attending it was

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:24,530
quite stress but it was very very nice

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:26,990
the feedback was very good so we are

00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:28,520
quite happy maybe we should have some

00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,940
more time to learn more about Syrian

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:36,410
queue before we used to be kind of the

00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:39,100
procrastinating people and and what the

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,320
feedback was really good we had a lot of

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,880
people working with engineering

00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:51,140
fantastically engineering also and so on

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:53,420
and yeah sorry then we had another

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,870
session with mocking to introduce the

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,180
search of the mock library which it's

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:03,260
not ranked read but it's very useful to

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:06,440
to find out to fake things happening

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:10,160
around a code in the architecture this

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,200
session was kind of but this because we

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,380
we hand it very prepared this was one of

00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,590
the first new kind of sessions we had we

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,890
went with a supposed cutter that we

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:23,690
invented which we haven't tried we will

00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:25,070
see later this is one of the very first

00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,660
things you need to do if you want to

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,660
arise certain decisions

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:40,230
ok and a little bit about what we have

00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:42,809
planned doing this because in decisions

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:46,439
we we also learn about people who comes

00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:49,439
on that one the first seems very

00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:51,929
elementary but you have to practice your

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:55,739
cattle before to do to their people and

00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:57,779
usually we find we try to think what

00:10:55,739 --> 00:11:00,029
what could be the different solution

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:04,109
that people we are going to find just to

00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:06,480
guide the session to be to be fun and to

00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:10,169
be fast and not to be boring but like

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,169
the people okay and you have obviously

00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:15,660
if you guy decision you have to have a

00:11:13,169 --> 00:11:18,329
specific knowledge but you don't have to

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,419
be a master you only have to have a main

00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:24,359
idea and usually people who comes to our

00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:27,899
20 Dodgers when we write usually the

00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:31,309
solution that they show I are almost

00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:34,679
better than us or have some points and

00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:39,360
we all the people in the session learn

00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:42,600
something yeah then okay if you

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,169
introduce a neoliberal probably you have

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,540
to take care to to show the basics of

00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:51,449
delivery you have to take time to all

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:55,850
the people start with an when with the

00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:58,949
same knowledge and the guy to station is

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:01,470
it's really important to have learning

00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:03,360
skills okay to learn teaching your

00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:05,489
skills and these kind of things I think

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,610
is the most important to feel that to

00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:11,879
fiddle to make feel comfortable all the

00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:17,189
people in the room yeah and then that

00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:19,019
it's useful now okay and then it's it's

00:12:17,189 --> 00:12:22,589
open to other programmers that come from

00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:25,319
other languages but we want what we try

00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:31,799
to focus on Pais ironic solutions of

00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:34,589
course ok and a little bit about the

00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,439
session we are going to do in a narrow

00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:39,869
Python can fly sensations we are going

00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:43,620
to focus to Spain a little bit baby

00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:46,120
steps until d how it works and

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,790
yeah practice by programming I don't

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,670
know if you who ever program it in pairs

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,180
but i think it's it's quite fun no just

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:58,240
to be three hours alone programming

00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,420
climbing alone okay I'm sorry and it's

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,980
just it's just a game but programming

00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:09,640
usually a pair programming the test on

00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:11,380
the other brand the program the code to

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:16,060
solve and then change the roles and

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:20,080
think it's you learn how to do the test

00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:23,170
go to program and one of the important

00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:26,440
part is yeah if you have a mac and a bit

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:29,320
see who who managed this decision which

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:31,900
editor with I'm sometimes you learn new

00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,030
things sharing with your partner even

00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:35,620
more than in the group okay and the

00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:38,320
satyr of the station is going to be a

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,790
little bit complex but ok these two

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:45,720
sessions are related to the typical

00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,330
algorithmic problems is are going to be

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,390
classical logarithmic problems ok just

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:55,120
to practice ddd okay privacy's more

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:58,830
focus and tdd in Saturday's is just

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,750
texting and in a more complex cata and

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,520
probably you are going to if you come

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,640
you are going to practice some

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,500
refactoring about the problem okay the

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:12,760
seeds are really really limited because

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:17,650
will we or sessions in Barcelona in a

00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:20,380
small group and we will we won't want to

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:24,160
be very personal in every group know

00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,980
what it's doing and we think that 20 25

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,790
people in the room mates it's how to

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:34,630
manage okay then come soon we are going

00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:36,460
to to publish in Twitter or I don't know

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,500
in the way we are going to to make

00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:45,550
another bright you are going to sing in

00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:48,400
sing it up and okay I think you are

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:53,920
going to sing it up and I want to see

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:58,720
your decisions okay a little bit about

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:02,050
and if you are interested in fighting

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,680
noises I think it's a good it's a good

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:08,260
way to spice your community I'm biasing

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,010
an organizer and science two years ago

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:15,699
about and I feel that okay you're a nice

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:18,279
meet up some conference what is a little

00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:21,430
bit call okay people come people see it

00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:26,260
here and go away I think it's with

00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:29,560
pedazos we have we have I community that

00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:33,790
you know what what is developing what

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,649
it's like a family now we will buy

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:41,589
dinners and these kind of things i think

00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:45,490
it's it's a relationship more okay it's

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:47,500
not water okay i think if you are

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:50,949
interested if you want to ask because

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,930
how to how to start the other coding

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:55,480
dojo in your community or if you want

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,920
some examples or some experience if you

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,010
want to share some experience with us

00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,459
where we are here on the week and we

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:06,339
recommend to read this this book about

00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:10,149
coding dojos handbook with my Emily

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:15,130
range and of course you can contact us

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:20,579
with using Twitter and a new person here

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,579
decide any question

00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:32,770
yeah yeah our décadas yeah do you

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:36,150
prepare it in advance or do you just go

00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:38,920
and you ask people what they want to do

00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,890
yeah we know a lot about people who

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:46,450
usually calm people repeat that's

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:49,570
important point but yeah when we asked

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,640
if people knew libraries if you want to

00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:53,710
try new liberals we we try different

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:57,310
formats yeah it depends on the people

00:16:53,710 --> 00:17:03,730
for this for the reason we we think that

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:05,920
would the FIBA that we that we get our

00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:07,780
decisions are very really really

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,330
important for us to know that it's

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:13,720
interesting or not or what to change in

00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:16,150
the next session with the cutter

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,710
preparation it also depends how much

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,660
under unique because sometimes you can

00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:22,510
have a very complex cut and then you

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:24,400
need like more than week to prepare that

00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:27,220
doesn't mean that you need to be careful

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,620
because if you prepare the category in

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:30,910
one way you can easily have a catalyst

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:34,300
longer the time you have for

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:40,470
organization but if it's simple you can

00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:40,470
even have it in easily 23 when our

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:44,430
questions

00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:52,250
I'll get loose actually how I organize

00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,900
the London pies and Cody ok we asked

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,000
actually we talked with someone with a

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,590
little a about that yes and then we

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,270
work absolutely how you what you were

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:01,430
doing because you are not doing so much

00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,190
TV right yeah I think we're doing quite

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,530
differently actually oh how does use

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:10,310
work you have only three percent to the

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:13,580
front and everyone is looking Oh legends

00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:15,590
around re yeah under format is that some

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,960
two peoples is working on the rest argue

00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:20,450
no we have been thinking about trying

00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,400
out different kinds of sessions for the

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,990
Dodgers this is one of the ones we have

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,230
in considered that we never did one of

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:30,170
those okay what we need is to start with

00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,960
pairing people then commenting the kata

00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:34,730
explaining what the details that we have

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,160
you can have or what complexion things

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,810
and then with people working in pairs

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,880
that working with that if they got a

00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:43,190
simple enough to run just one in one

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,830
iteration then we try to enforce people

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,750
to switch the team so they can share

00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:49,700
with more people in the same session if

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,900
they got these more complex then we just

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:56,660
stand with that and go on with unusually

00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,430
van wish well we we aim the people to

00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,080
share the coat and explain the control

00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:09,620
oh ok now many iterations are you doing

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:11,810
roughly like me for this like she said

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,210
before there's always must wrestle

00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:17,150
someone attending that masters much more

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:20,090
than you so yeah we had for example one

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,860
guy with one katha the guys has solved

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,100
the first iteration the second iteration

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,770
on the 30 days using the first one so we

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:30,410
went yeah you can't write to have this

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:34,160
time you you always have to think more

00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:36,560
motor stuffed more thunder and the time

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,650
you you have because of the people who

00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:43,730
is coming yeah not two people we try to

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:46,070
enjoy other people and we also started

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:49,140
doing something this by the end of the

00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:53,310
year it was we are we provide a session

00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:57,060
the three months every quarter so we use

00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:58,650
we use we need we do a very simple kappa

00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:01,110
in the first month in the second month

00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:05,130
videos with a more complex cutter with

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:11,420
less DVD or less test focused and then

00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:11,420
we have a third session we say thank you

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,540
can ask more questions so with the last

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,060
one okay how many of you are coming

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:23,340
every day j and where it's been

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,880
depending also on the log of festivities

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,690
and so on especially the bars affordable

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:33,000
marty is having a much we choose the

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,980
weights in advance yeah its really three

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,890
months out of bands on sometimes we

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:42,750
don't know but we used to be like time

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:45,660
50 people okay and do you provide pn

00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:48,750
pizza or something this well we had some

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,270
kind of things yeah cookies yeah we

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,010
sometimes like pizza it's kind of things

00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:59,910
that yeah but we're playing to talk with

00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:03,650
some and we staying for forreston we

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:07,320
sprang for the cookies and appears and
