Description: 
	Ben Nuttall - Physical computing with Python and Raspberry Pi
[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]

With the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to do physical computing directly
from Python code - rather than usual embedded hardware engineering in
C or Assembler.

In this talk I'll show examples of physical computing projects that
use Python on Raspberry Pi and demonstrate the sort of code  used in
such projects.

Physical computing with Python is very popular in education - as it's
so engaging, and more interesting than printing to the screen.

This will be an informative session with learning possibilities to
give those new to physical computing a change to get started.

morning everyone welcome great to be

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,150
back at you're a Python it's my talk

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,860
physical computing with Python and the

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,320
Raspberry Pi my name is Ben Nestle I'm

00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,090
from the Raspberry Pi foundation we're

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,070
gonna be we've got a series of talks

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,050
today so we just had carry-ons brilliant

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,039
keynote and we've got a few talks lined

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,400
up in this track related to education

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,480
and it's the education summit this

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,340
expands to this weekend as well we've

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,680
got some sprints and education stuff

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:38,129
trying to crack on with keriann's list

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,200
that she's given us all to do so a bit

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:41,640
behind me to start i'm education

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,670
developer advocate at the Raspberry Pi

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,250
foundation a new software and projects

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:50,370
kind of develop stuff in internally and

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,809
do some I write learning resources that

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,300
go on our website the free and Creative

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,579
Commons learning platform we have there

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,410
we want teacher training courses there's

00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,489
something called Pike Adam II and I do a

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,460
lot of outreach go to a lot of

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:06,090
conferences and and stuff we're based in

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,210
Cambridge in the UK ah that's me on

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,400
Twitter BAM underscore not all and if

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,119
you were at Europe I thurnpike on UK

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,170
piss pike on island or euro side pie

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,119
last year you may have seen me speak so

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,729
just a quick update so since since I was

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,380
here last year and the news this really

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,030
relates to hardware we've we've now got

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,729
a Raspberry Pi to second-generation

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,450
Raspberry Pi it's now a 900 megahertz

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,950
quad core on v7 with a gig of ram it's

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,810
backwards compatible and exactly the

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,390
same shape and size as the previous

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,869
model the B+ we kept it at the same

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:49,740
price which is $35 and reduced the old

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:51,750
ones down to 25 and the A+ is 20 so we

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,149
are an educational charity as carry-ons

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,130
just been talking about it's not

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,110
something that kind of came afterwards

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,000
and kind of bolted on to a computer

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,060
company or a hardware company it the

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,670
idea was originally to help education

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,879
that's why we wanted to create something

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:11,489
to empower young people and give them a

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,260
possibility to learn programming skills

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,540
and learn about computing

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,360
from an early age in a kind of sandbox

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,590
environment they've been on general sale

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,480
since 2012 and they've been made

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,129
available worldwide to everybody who

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,879
wants one for the same price we're not

00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,079
limiting in this - to just children or

00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,909
just the developing world

00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:35,010
it's the same price for everyone because

00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:36,930
that's really really helpful to have

00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,010
that cold community around the raspberry

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,599
pie I'll give some examples we write

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,120
free learning resources for makers and

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,180
educators and as I say we have this pie

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,650
Academy our teacher training CPD course

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,760
professional development course that

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,190
currently in the UK

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,859
we've run a few around the UK and we're

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,900
taking it to the USA next year and we'd

00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:02,430
like to see more things like that around

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,510
the world so a couple of stories to

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,170
start they're kind of about our

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,190
community and about our origins and how

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,920
how things have developed over the last

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,159
three years been crossed in is a guy in

00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,840
the UK who brews beer and he wanted to

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,790
use the Raspberry Pi to control the beer

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,989
brewing process and kind of monitor it

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,040
from his phone and have a web app

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,639
running in that kind of thing

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:27,239
chose the Raspberry Pi and chose Python

00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,680
to write it in so he started to develop

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,510
a platform which allowed him to

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,519
communicate over the GPIO pins I'll

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,349
explain more about those in the next few

00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:39,780
slides and that project became you know

00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,280
it kind of output a library that it

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,169
became a general-purpose library for

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,530
that's how you talk to the GPIO pins

00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:51,269
from Python another example Dave Jones

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,699
also in the UK his wife's a

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,639
paleontologist and she wanted to use a

00:03:53,699 --> 00:03:59,370
microscope to do some fossil photography

00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:01,079
and that kind of thing and he he's the

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,549
the problem with was that the

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,190
university's microscope was a real

00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:06,900
pallava to use and it sort of sort

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:08,459
stored it to an external drive somewhere

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,199
else on the network that you had to then

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,229
get permission to access and it was a

00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:15,479
real real pain so he created he said

00:04:13,229 --> 00:04:17,010
just stick a PI camera on the top and

00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,329
then you'll get the the picture straight

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,570
out and be able to use them so he built

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,659
a little wet up web app that allowed her

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,360
to kind of monitor and deal with all the

00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:29,379
pictures that came out of it and

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:32,389
- again this became the general-purpose

00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:35,479
pie-pie camera library and it's an it's

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:36,800
a fantastic resource for people to

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,030
anyone who wants to use the camera for

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,680
anything and he's been working on it

00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,879
ever since in fact I told him recently

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,490
because I kind of talked about this at

00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:45,949
all of my talks and I said oh by the way

00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,060
I I always use you as an example of when

00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,669
I'm talking about community at the

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,610
conference's about how you you created

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,439
the the web app for for your wife and

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,849
and you said oh did I is that why I

00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:57,849
started oh I ought to finish that

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:04,849
so raspbian this is our Linux

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,539
distribution that we use as a foundation

00:05:04,849 --> 00:05:10,969
issued Debian based distribution

00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:13,159
currently based on Debian wheezy that

00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:15,069
Jessie is now kind of stable so where

00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:18,289
we're going to be moving to that shortly

00:05:15,069 --> 00:05:20,180
the image that we provide supports PI 2

00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:25,639
and PI 1 even though they're different

00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:28,610
architectures on 6 & 7 but we we make

00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:32,240
sure that we still support our old users

00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,759
on the old platform we we pre install

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,860
certain software on on that image so you

00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,639
get the Python interpreter you get Idol

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,379
unfortunately and a bunch of other stuff

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,089
there's Ruby on their sonic PI Java

00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,349
Mathematica and stuff like that we kind

00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:50,120
of put in the image and create it so

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:53,050
that you can use it out of the box we

00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,310
have other things as well that community

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:56,800
contributed so the GPIO library and the

00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:59,659
plant camera library for instance are

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,879
for example examples of what's already

00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,529
installed and once we move onto to

00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:07,310
Jessie it will be a lot easier for us to

00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,900
ship with pip pre-installed there's

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,750
there's alternative distribution is

00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:13,789
available so Ubuntu now we're on arm v7

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:17,210
also works but and there are other ones

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:18,349
like Arch Linux but we support raspy and

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,719
ourselves and maintain that ourselves

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:22,490
and all our educational or for

00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:24,319
educational and general general purpose

00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,800
use we recommend raspbian you can get

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,930
that from Raspberry Pi org so the GPIO

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,740
pins so this this Bank along the top

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,360
there we refer to as the GPIO bank now

00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,370
strictly speaking that all not all

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,800
general-purpose so they called GPIO

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,740
general purpose input output strictly

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,180
speaking than oil

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,280
on purpose so you can see this little

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,110
this is a little excess reasonably made

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,539
our communities full of cool stuff like

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,080
this that people create and put on sale

00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,580
and there's whole businesses around this

00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,990
but this this is a little pin diagram

00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,270
that you just stick up over the top of

00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,310
the pins there to tell you which which

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:01,770
pin is which so you can see here there's

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,530
some three volt pins and survived five

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,330
volt pins some ground pins and then

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,870
these ones are GP and they have numbers

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:12,690
so the GP 19 is general purpose pin 19

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,720
and those ones you can you can control

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,360
you can have inputs or outputs listening

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,580
for inputs or sending outputs you can

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:24,569
wire things up to those two to do

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,370
physical computing analog so there's no

00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:29,210
native analog pins on on there they're

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:32,490
all digital pins so ones and zeros and

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,590
but there are options if you want to use

00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,770
analog inputs with with Raspberry Pi so

00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:41,370
you can use an ADC to convert analog

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,490
into digital and there's various arduino

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:46,289
compatible add-on boards available and

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:48,599
there's also pi serial the the python

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,810
module for talking to reading audrina

00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:55,530
pins over USB so let's have a look at

00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:57,270
the the r Pi GPIO library so this is

00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:00,539
including raspbian and the

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:03,060
implementation is in c features are

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:04,919
you've got you configure pins so you

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,050
give a pin number and you say you define

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,000
that pin to be an input or an output and

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,940
then you can change them in your script

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,159
you can read the inputs so you can say

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,469
is this is this bond high although you

00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:19,080
can just get the value of it and you can

00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:21,080
send output so you you can say turn this

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,490
pin on if it's if it's an output pin

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,199
there's also a feature called weight for

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,300
edge so an edge is when something

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,750
changes from from high to low or low to

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,000
high and you can you can have some

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,860
script that sort of pauses and waits for

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,240
something to change like wait for the

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,640
button to be pressed and then continue

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,969
and there's event detection with

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,159
callbacks so you can run a function on

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,450
the event of something happening like a

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,790
sensor going off or a button being

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,110
pressed so what kind of this is kind of

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:53,010
fundamental so everything you might need

00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,180
in such a program so just a quick

00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,680
example we've got

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,190
some stuff on a breadboard here we have

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,230
a circuit connecting putting three volts

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,960
through an LED and through a resistor to

00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,850
limit the current then we have it going

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,520
back to ground so that just completes a

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,020
circuit it's kind of there's lots a

00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,640
little bits of basic electronics that

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,990
kind of help you with these sorts of

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,410
projects I don't know an awful lot about

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:19,950
this but just just enough to get by this

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,260
is just a complete circuit with an LED

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,640
in it and putting three volts through

00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:25,529
there that gets a limit current listed

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,750
limited through the resistor just means

00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:29,220
that this is always on so this I can't I

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,080
can't change this in my program

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:32,940
it's just connected to always be on

00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,899
because it's sending three volts through

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,870
if I move that from the 3 V 3 pin to

00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:43,589
GPIO 2 then I can write a program which

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,930
turns pin 2 on and turns to pin 2 off so

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:48,149
this is what the code would look like so

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,720
we import the chip IO library we set the

00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:53,399
mode because annoyingly there are two

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,480
numbering systems for the pins because

00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:01,020
you know one isn't enough so we set the

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,459
mode to BCAM which is the the actual

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,320
numbers that they are according to the

00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:08,900
chip so that GP 2 GP 3 GP 4 so we set

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,010
the mode tell it which mode we're using

00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,870
we're gonna I'm using a variable here

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,029
just just to say where which pin I'm

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:19,440
using which which pin represents the LED

00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:21,380
I set up that pin as an output and then

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,560
here's just a little bit that just goes

00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:27,450
turn it on sleep turn it off sleep in a

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,670
loop so that's just flashing the LED on

00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,520
and off this is really empowering for

00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:34,920
especially for young people offer offer

00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,870
anyone instead of just having something

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,690
saying print hello world or frying range

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,920
10 print I this is something flashing

00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:45,990
something in the real world something

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:49,230
physical this is another example a

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:52,860
simple circuit where we've got a button

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:55,050
going from GPIO 17 through to ground so

00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,540
just complete a circuit there we can

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,250
listen on pin 17 and wait for that

00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,459
button press so this is what the code

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:04,050
would look like in this case I'm

00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,450
actually using the PI camera library so

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,400
that the button is going to trigger the

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,500
camera to take a picture

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:15,330
so this is just the setup so we have our

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:21,750
set mode button is pin 17 setup pin 17

00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:23,490
as an input and this is the pull this is

00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,920
a that's wrong actually that should be

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:28,260
there should be pull up or down so sorry

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,000
this is so we set it up we tell it which

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,720
pin what it's going to be and then here

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,440
should be GPIO pull pull up or pull down

00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,700
and this is a this is an electronics bet

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,550
though I'm actually electronics which

00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,860
determines whether a floating value like

00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,160
a digital input is you kind of send it

00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,260
to high or low and then you wait for it

00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,060
to fall if you've if you've pulled it up

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,920
that means it's been pressed and if you

00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:58,830
if you pull it down you wait for it to

00:11:52,920 --> 00:12:00,450
rise this is a mistake so here we and

00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:02,430
then the following on so that's our set

00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,350
up and following on we have with with

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,020
with the camera so with an instance of a

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:08,850
camera PI camera object we start the

00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,850
preview which means you see what the

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:14,490
camera sees in real time then we have a

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,810
loop which just says wait for that

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,700
button to be pressed wait for that to

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:20,940
fall so I should I would have pulled it

00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,770
up on the previous previous slide and

00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,660
then it just sits and waits for that

00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:27,000
button to be pressed on 17 remember this

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,279
is 17 wait for that button to be pressed

00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,720
and then continue so it would go on to

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:35,940
this line and capture a frame then it is

00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,060
right round incrementing the frame

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,160
number which would go into this bit here

00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:42,150
and then this is pointless because it's

00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,190
a while true but you could have

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,170
something to catch that 2 to exit like a

00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:49,980
second button or just a keyboard

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:52,709
interrupt another example here we've got

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,900
this is for a GPIO music box so instead

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,080
of wiring up just one button we were up

00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,950
to so we have two buttons we've got one

00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,470
going to GPIO to one going to GPIO three

00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:09,510
then I create an ADD use Advent detect

00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:13,290
on that button looking for a falling

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:15,450
edge because I've pulled it up the

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:18,480
callback is the function I've defined as

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,910
play and the bounce time which means how

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,900
long it takes how long it takes before

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,990
it lets

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,360
the event come in a thousand

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,910
milliseconds so one second so I would

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,210
have a function here that called play

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:35,040
which I define is my callback and then

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:37,860
all I'm doing here is saying when when

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,020
this this is when this is called and it

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,240
passes in the pin number that actually

00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,030
triggered the event into the function I

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,450
look up which which pin in here and I

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:50,790
get this is a PI game sound object and

00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,390
then I can just go sound up play so I

00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,250
know which pin was pressed two or three

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,470
according to which one that's why you do

00:13:56,250 --> 00:14:02,220
this on I would do this on both both

00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,710
buttons then look up which sound to play

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,680
and play it really simple

00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:09,630
straightforward example of using events

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,100
for multiple button presses and doing

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:15,180
different things according to different

00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,920
inputs there's something great for for

00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,380
these types of projects which are really

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,240
kind of small and simple but really

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,870
really empowering and really can be

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,480
really interesting and engaging they're

00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:28,710
called the cam jam kit they're just just

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,150
a collection of little bits really

00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,310
useful bits for lots of these types of

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,110
projects there's this is kit one which

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:37,530
has a breadboard some buttons lights and

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:40,890
resistors or wires and this is kit two

00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:43,020
which is has a load of sensors so it's

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,420
got a passive infrared sensor so you can

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,000
use that as a motion detector it's got

00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,750
some LEDs a buzzer and some other bits

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,450
in the breadboard

00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:53,400
these are really cheap so these these

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:55,050
cost five pounds and this one cost five

00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,290
pounds this one costs seven pounds it's

00:14:55,050 --> 00:15:00,810
a really kind of pocket money

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,130
electronics and they come with a bunch

00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,490
of resources that you can follow along

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:06,990
and these are just put together by one

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,480
of these raspberry jam the community

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,620
events in partnership with one of the

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,150
Raspberry Pi community resellers and

00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,250
accessory sellers they just got together

00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,830
and made this really cheap and try to

00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:23,120
try to put it out there for more people

00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,120
to get involved in this sort of thing

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:34,150
once the once the Raspberry Pi came out

00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,070
there was a lot of a lot of add on

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,540
boards and accessories have been brought

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,000
out this is one of the first ones one of

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:42,370
the early ones by a guy called Gert he's

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,510
actually one of the chip architects at

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:44,529
the company that made the chip that we

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,050
use he's very knowledgeable about

00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:49,589
Raspberry Pi and here's him teaching me

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,110
to solder while I'm wearing an elf hat

00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:54,580
he made this board called the Gert board

00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:55,990
which is you know he's an engineer and

00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,910
he thinks this is this is exactly what

00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,279
people need this is an amazing board

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,480
that gives you loads more potential to

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,020
get out of your Raspberry Pi I've got

00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,070
all these all this stuff on it and you

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,420
know technically he was right though

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:09,370
it's a really cool board and it can

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,640
potentially do all these things but he

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:15,100
didn't provide any software for it and

00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,870
he probably just put you know here's a C

00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,080
program which you know you can use for

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,990
for this for this mini project and and

00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,080
another barrier to this was that

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,760
initially it came pre-installed it so

00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,230
you would buy a kit like that and you

00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,240
have to solve the Rope all about entire

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,339
board and then there was no software and

00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,650
no examples really to use it so a lot of

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:36,880
people kind of get turned off by that

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:39,760
sort of thing because they they want to

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,410
get they want to get going so I'm can I

00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,550
try go progressively through kind of

00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:47,950
good examples so this one is a young

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,610
young lad actually he was about 17 when

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,890
he when he created this called Ryan

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,450
includes a little add-on board there

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,060
just as one thing really well it's just

00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,100
a little motor motor controller board so

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,980
you can drive motors seen use it in

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:05,140
robotics he didn't provide any software

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,730
for this but he know nobody spokes now

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,620
everybody shows you how you can use the

00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,810
two piyo library to drive the pins

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,300
forward so you can as long as you know

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,839
which pin is which so which pin it's

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,089
connected to he will just say pin 17 is

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,929
you know the left motor forward or pin

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,220
18 is the right motor back then you've

00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,720
got enough to go with and you just write

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,800
a little bit of code similar to the

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,510
examples I showed you earlier just

00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,980
turning pins off for a certain amount of

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:31,690
time and it will drive forward they'll

00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,580
spin around or whatever it is that

00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,130
you've asked it to do it so it's kind of

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,480
cool and a nice nice learning like nice

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:41,710
not too steep learning curve

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,340
this is another example which is kind of

00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:51,309
further along the spectrum it's a little

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:53,950
add-on board that has three LEDs call it

00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:56,139
like traffic lights it has a button and

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,639
a buzzer and a bunch of extra inputs on

00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:00,009
the front as well they provide a

00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:03,100
software library for this so import

00:18:00,009 --> 00:18:05,590
paella you've got a full abstract of

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,899
abstraction away from which GPIO pins

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:10,389
things are connected to you just refer

00:18:07,899 --> 00:18:13,509
to them by that the the light and the

00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:16,210
color so you just you just run this

00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,499
function PI Brella dot light green dot

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:23,139
on the green light comes on

00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:25,330
instead of GPIO GPIO output 17 true you

00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:26,799
have turned the green light on there's a

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,220
really nice abstraction especially for

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:32,499
young children to get involved even even

00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,519
less of a steep learning curve there's

00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:35,649
plenty you can do with this as well

00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,629
they've they've even got event detection

00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:40,929
so you can create a function that that

00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:42,159
flashes it so turn it on for one second

00:18:40,929 --> 00:18:44,159
so this is this is actually all the

00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,239
lights because I didn't specify a color

00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,070
sleep for one second then turn them off

00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:50,649
and then I can say when the button is

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:52,720
pressed run that function so when I

00:18:50,649 --> 00:18:54,940
press the button flash the lights all

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:59,799
the lights on for one second and there's

00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:02,409
loads of places you can take this this

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,210
is an add-on board called energy knee

00:19:02,409 --> 00:19:06,220
it's a company that makes remote control

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,539
switches so you can buy a remote you can

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,279
turn off the Christmas lights from

00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:11,409
Christmas tree lights from without

00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,999
having to get right behind it they then

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:15,639
they made an Raspberry Pi out on board

00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:18,039
so this just sits on top and they

00:19:15,639 --> 00:19:20,379
provided you a massive file with about

00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:24,999
50 lines of Python saying this is how

00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:26,379
you turn switches on and off we we had a

00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:29,289
young girl with us on work experience

00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:30,639
she was about 15 we said can you take a

00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:33,279
look at this code kind of tidy it up

00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:35,169
work out the logic and kind of and then

00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,799
put it into into a function that you can

00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:39,340
turn them on and turn them off because

00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,929
fifteen-year-old girls are better at

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:46,389
programming than the people who make

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:48,879
this thing and then I packaged it and

00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:51,849
took all the credit and put it on on pip

00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:52,190
so you import energy nee switch on and

00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:54,950
switch

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:57,700
you can pass in the number of if you've

00:19:54,950 --> 00:20:02,150
got a bank of 4 1 2 3 4 you can turn on

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:06,350
the the sockets arbitrarily with with

00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,760
numbers I also made a little web app to

00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,200
it show that you can you can do this

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,300
sort of thing this is just a little

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,900
basic flight flask app which is on the

00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:17,030
on the documentation that you just press

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:18,920
that on your phone to turn them on and

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,680
turn them off that was running on a

00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,970
local netbook work but if you configured

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,590
your Rooter correctly you could do that

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,610
over the internet and there's plenty of

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:32,090
services to help you do that as well so

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:33,980
a bit over a year ago we we moved from

00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:36,530
the original as we PI this one the

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,420
original montrezl we PI model B to the B

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:41,630
plus so this was still Raspberry Pi 1

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:44,420
but it was a plus version and we

00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,400
extended the the pins from a 26 pin to

00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,140
40 pin so you get a lot more to play

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:52,550
with so the the examples I've shown you

00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:54,530
so far of hardware were would would sit

00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:56,900
on the 26 pin Bank and they still work

00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:01,210
because the first 26 pins are exactly

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:04,910
the same but we also defined a

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,380
specification for add-on boards people

00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,930
don't have to follow this they can still

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,090
make 26 pin ones they can still make 40

00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,730
pin ones in a different not following

00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:15,290
the rules but we we call these hats so

00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,030
it's hardware attached on top so a

00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:20,530
Raspberry Pi hats are the name of the

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:23,360
official specification for add-on boards

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:25,010
it has features such as you can you can

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,020
use ribbon cables like this if you if

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:29,450
you cut it out and if you put it in

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,480
exactly the right dimensions it will fit

00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:35,180
nicely on top of a B+ or an A+ or a

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,830
Raspberry Pi 2 and you can use mounting

00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,720
holes because we've got use the mounting

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:44,930
holes with with screws to just hold it

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:47,450
in place one of the projects we worked

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,860
on last year was using looking at

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,950
sous-vide cooking which is where you get

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,530
a vacuum packed food such as such as

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,320
steak like this and you cook it in water

00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,300
at a very precise temperature so we

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,590
decided to design some hardware to do

00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,110
this we just approached typing first

00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:04,980
with with bread boards and stuff and

00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:08,340
then we had somebody create

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:10,020
- an actual hat for this so if it's a

00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,350
hat for cooking it's called the chef's

00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:17,250
hat so it's like this we use the energy

00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:18,540
nee the room to remotely control the the

00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:20,520
coat it's kind of done really and that

00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:22,370
we're just using a temperature sensor in

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,500
the water and if it's if it's too high

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,210
we if it's the temperatures too honey we

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,460
turn it on at too low we turn it on

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,020
otherwise we turn it off notice there's

00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,559
a little idea that I'm working on it's a

00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:36,600
work in progress we have another board

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,850
called these are just some kind of

00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:41,040
internal projects that that we we've

00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:44,040
been working on there's one called the

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:48,900
dots board which is uses conductive

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:50,280
paint and there's a load of little holes

00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,750
on on this board little dots on this

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:54,150
board that you use the paint with a

00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,419
paintbrush to to draw a pattern from to

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:58,980
connect the dots we tried this out at a

00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:01,919
couple of events we went to make affair

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,770
and South by Southwest and got really

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,120
young children engaged in in doing

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:09,210
something more interesting than than

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,650
just typing on screen so they they they

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:12,630
sit there for five minutes five or ten

00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,700
minutes just drawing out that plane

00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,320
really really intricately and then they

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,830
take it over to the Raspberry Pi

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,470
stick it on top and then they run a

00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,530
Python program that draws a plane in the

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,610
colors that they chose along the top

00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:30,059
which is kind of really really novel

00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:32,070
idea and this is this is the some of

00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:34,710
this part of the software I mean it all

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:37,950
we do here is so we have a pin is that

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:41,549
is active function so we just check

00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:47,100
whether given the list of pins we know

00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:48,840
to be the the aeroplane pins then we

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:51,600
just count how many of them are active

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:53,340
and not so just just by putting paint

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,230
over and connects the outside of the dot

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:57,809
to the inside which shorts at the ground

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,000
which you can detect in software and

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:01,410
then we just have you know how many of

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,299
them are connected and if enough of them

00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:07,710
are connected we show the plane it was a

00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:10,140
little PI game PI game app another one

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,790
the the plant pot greenhouse so this is

00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,929
a beautiful looking board designed by

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:17,490
Rachel Raines from a Raspberry Pi

00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:18,100
foundation and it's so this bit you've

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,720
kind of

00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,910
all of these bits out so this bit sits

00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,020
on top of the pie that's kind of hat

00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:27,880
like and then you have a wire running to

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,730
the censor board which is this stick

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:34,390
here that you stick that in soil it's

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,160
got a soil moisture sensor a light

00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,419
sensor and temperature and humidity and

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,260
you just use it to monitor the

00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:43,900
conditions of the plant the weave you

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:46,059
put inside a little acrylic kind of

00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,730
greenhouse thing so the pie is inside

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:50,530
there and then it LEDs on top of the

00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:52,659
board glow according to the whatever you

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,950
programmed it to to do according to the

00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:57,970
weather it needs watering or something

00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:59,890
like that this is one made by an amazing

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:02,440
American company called Adafruit the

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,350
capacitive touch hat so you stick this

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,539
on top of the pie and you wire up

00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:10,299
crocodile clips to each of the pins to

00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:12,159
each of the holes on there and then you

00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,080
can this bill I can make you make you

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,799
where you can build a piano with fruit

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,200
or something like that

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,320
you wire up that up to anything and then

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,309
in Python just read which ones have been

00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:24,780
which ones have been pressed and then

00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:24,780
have different actions according to that

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,929
there's a bunch of really cool hats made

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,760
by the community and made by these

00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,470
companies that have accessories pi

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,720
Maroney is a brilliant example they were

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,669
one half of the team that built the pi

00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,490
briella that i mentioned earlier this is

00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:44,409
the unicorn hat so it's a nice 8x8

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,980
neopixel grid that you can program

00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:49,480
really simply the skywriter which is you

00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:51,750
can hover your hand over it and it will

00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,250
you can assign different events to

00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,840
gestures or how close you are and things

00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,669
like that

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:02,409
the propeller hats which is a little

00:25:57,669 --> 00:26:05,200
prototyping board and the Explorer hat

00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:06,580
which is has got a lot of capacitive

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,730
touch things all along the side and

00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:11,590
sublights here and you can control

00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,600
motors from these extra pins you have

00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,000
here really easily and this whole thing

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,409
is really helpful to put out there

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,350
because it means a teacher can pick that

00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:23,890
up and really simply put together a

00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:26,770
simple robot or or or anything they use

00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,090
motors or capacitive touch and the great

00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,740
thing about Pi Maroney is that they

00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:31,570
provide the software libraries in Python

00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,910
and all the reason in Python

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:36,880
three unfortunately we we always nag

00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:38,890
them about this but but it's great that

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,270
we can we can have this sort of thing

00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:45,280
readily available we have something

00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,440
another internal project where we've

00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,820
made this weather station so it's a

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,380
board that sits on the PI that has some

00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:54,490
stuff going off to some other sensors

00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,880
we've made we've produced this in-house

00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,320
and having having it manufactured and

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,900
we're sending a thousand of them to

00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,000
schools around the world to collect

00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,130
weather data and feed into a big

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,930
database and that's gonna be really

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,160
called James Robinson my colleague is

00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:13,270
gonna be giving a talk about that and

00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:15,760
later on today so this was again this

00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:17,380
was prototypes on a breadboard and just

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,120
components and looking at different

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,520
sensors and then some software running

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,580
that just reads the sensors logs it uses

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,370
a database that kind of thing we have a

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,740
this is kind of our headline project of

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:32,050
the year Astro PI if you haven't heard

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,370
of it is that we're sending two

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,710
raspberry PI's to the international

00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:37,630
space station at the end of this year

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:40,000
British Easter astronaut tim peake

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:41,170
is going to be going up in December and

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,660
he's taking these two raspberry PI's

00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:45,580
with him he's going to be doing some

00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:48,190
educational outreach as part of his six

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,810
months in space so there's there's some

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:53,590
kind of a general education stuff

00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:55,600
they're sending some rocket seeds into

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,730
space and then and bringing the back and

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,010
then giving distributing them to schools

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:02,350
too for them to experiment with with the

00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,060
growing the seas to see if to compare

00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,210
its but seeds that have been in space

00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,340
with with with regular seats that

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,560
haven't been in space to see if there's

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,060
any difference in their growth and for

00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,310
them to think start thinking about space

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,610
more and another another program is this

00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:21,310
Ashley applied competition which is

00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:25,270
we've built this sensor board which sits

00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:27,580
a hat that goes on the pie and there's a

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:31,300
competition for kids to write code for

00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:33,460
the sensor board that they will pick the

00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,560
winners and run that code in space so

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,480
primary school and secondary school kids

00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,610
in the UK have had have had a chance

00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,270
this year to have their code run in

00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:45,549
space the Astro Pi boys we call it the

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:48,909
sense hat this is what it looks like

00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:51,850
got a little 8x8 grid that you can

00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:53,169
that's an RGB LED matrix it's got a

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,139
bunch of sensors so you can get the

00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,820
temperature humidity pressure

00:28:55,139 --> 00:28:59,799
accelerometer gyroscope magnetometer and

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:02,259
it also has a mini joystick for input

00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,470
we've been through a lot of testing of

00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:08,139
getting this Hardware suited them

00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:09,429
suitably acceptable for space for flight

00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:12,399
in space and it's gone through all sorts

00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:13,840
of vibration testing and all sorts of

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,080
things to make sure that it's it's safe

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,149
to be in orbit it's going to be mounted

00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,570
on the wall in one of the the modules on

00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:24,369
on the the ISS and it's gonna be there

00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:26,200
after Tim Peake comes back so we're

00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:29,169
hoping to do more things with them once

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,549
they're up there this hardware is gonna

00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:32,289
be really handy for a lot of people as

00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:33,519
well not just for the competition so

00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:35,619
this should be going on sale within the

00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,159
next couple of months we're really handy

00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:41,590
for a lot of projects so just to finish

00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:43,389
off we've again to remind you that we've

00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,100
got this education summit so there's

00:29:43,389 --> 00:29:49,359
have a look at the rest of the talks and

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:51,009
on this track for the rest of the day so

00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,269
my colleagues and I and and some and

00:29:51,009 --> 00:29:53,139
some of the other people from the

00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:55,389
community gonna be talking about

00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:57,309
Education Raspberry Pi and and and all

00:29:55,389 --> 00:30:00,009
sorts of other things and also at the

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,330
weekend we have some sprints so if

00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:02,980
anyone wants to come and hack with us on

00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,600
on different educational projects and

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,889
hopefully we'll have some teachers there

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,359
and see what they have to say as well so

00:30:08,889 --> 00:30:12,899
thanks very much and I will I'm closed

00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,899
for questions

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:23,840
so do we have any questions

00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:37,850
I've been thanks it was a really good

00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:39,710
talk so I'm quite obsessed with space

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:40,730
just as much as I am about programming

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:42,500
could you tell us a little bit more

00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:44,660
about the tests you had to actually put

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:47,390
the hat through in order to be able to

00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,559
take it up into orbit yeah so I don't

00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,000
know an awful lot about this cuz I

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,700
wasn't I wasn't part of the testing team

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,640
but I kind of hear a lot from it but

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,230
we've got a developer called Dave who's

00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,000
who's been doing all these tests and

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,890
he's really really keen telling us all

00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,630
about it so for the actual launch so for

00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,820
it to the rocket the shuttle to go up

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,230
they have to it vibrates a lot so they

00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,350
have to make sure that it doesn't break

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,929
and break apart during the joining the

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:17,120
launch we have to make sure that there's

00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:18,410
no kind of radioactive materials coming

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,059
out or anything anything kind of bad

00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:23,030
leaking out into into the air that could

00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:25,070
be harmful to the astronauts they have

00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,720
to kind of Chateau on with a hammer or

00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:28,820
something and see kind of what bits come

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,490
off and what what could be harmful you

00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:33,490
know and test it again after that and

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,169
also things like heat that it doesn't

00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,760
doesn't gain an excessive heat and

00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:41,929
actually built a special case for it

00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,299
which is probably the most over

00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:48,950
engineered case besides the one that we

00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:51,460
made recently for general use there's

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,830
ever been made that's a great big giant

00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:57,080
aluminium case that has the matrix the

00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:59,210
LED matrix shown a little hole for the

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,700
camera and it's got it's designed in a

00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:03,919
very specific way for for the heat not

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,700
to radiate so make sure that it doesn't

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,600
get hot hot to the touch or even radio

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:10,600
to radiate out

00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:21,809
I like your talk and I was just looking

00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,990
at the Raspberry Pi homepage and so I

00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:27,990
have a question is are there any

00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:31,740
Bluetooth possibilities with Raspberry

00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:34,230
Pi so there's no there's no built-in

00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:39,030
bluetooth on the Raspberry Pi but you

00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:40,650
can use a USB dongle so if you have if

00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,780
you have some Bluetooth device that you

00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:45,450
can you can pair with you can you can do

00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:49,980
that yeah we I think we use I think the

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:52,049
Wii Remote the the remote the remote for

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,790
that is bluetooth and you I've seen

00:32:52,049 --> 00:32:54,720
people do projects with that where

00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,880
they're waving that we've moat around

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,070
driving the robot forward and that kind

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:05,640
of thing so yes it's definitely possibly

00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:08,700
just neither a USB dongle yes the the

00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:10,530
the Cody showed is actually quite simple

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,270
in sment it's been kids to be able to

00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:18,470
use of course but I don't know if the

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,850
rod repine has got any visual

00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:23,900
programming environments like the like

00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:26,580
for instance like the logo on the OLPC

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:28,140
lx100 generator I've seen that this is

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:31,309
very simple just drag and drop things

00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:33,510
and you then make the turtle do stuff

00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:34,679
but I was actually thinking that with

00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,860
something like physical computing you

00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:40,020
you it would be even nicer to have a

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,940
physical block dragging or block

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,400
aggregation programming farming do you

00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,370
know have any projects on that direction

00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,070
so the Rosary pod comes bundled with

00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:52,890
scratch scratch is a popular visual

00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:54,150
block based programming language really

00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:55,580
good for the beginners and really good

00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:57,840
for young children as their first

00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:00,330
programming experience not having to

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,419
think about syntax or or even bothering

00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:06,960
to type anything but just being able to

00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:08,850
click and drag and drop so that's that's

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,030
the scratch is pre-installed and

00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:14,940
there are possibilities for extending

00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:17,100
that to be able to use GPIO so you can

00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,359
actually drive robots forward with but

00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:22,980
with your drag-and-drop program in

00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,869
scratch we tend to in our mind we tend

00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,850
to look at scratch as the first the

00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:27,629
first step the second step is really

00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:31,289
good Moo

00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:33,569
of above above and beyond scratch called

00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:36,000
sonic pie which carry on discussed this

00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:41,129
morning as based on Ruby and so there's

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,319
not as much precision required in the in

00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:44,909
the syntax not quite as much as Python

00:34:43,319 --> 00:34:46,769
even though we all like to think python

00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:48,629
is is great for that but we kind of we

00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:50,609
see tabs and we see spaces and we see

00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:53,700
colons kids don't really see that stuff

00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:55,379
so sonic pies some a nice step forward

00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,619
before they before they get to Python

00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:02,880
they can do more but you can and there's

00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:05,130
also turtle in Python so that's

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:11,099
available as well so that's that's

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:14,480
another good one okay there's no other

00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:14,480
