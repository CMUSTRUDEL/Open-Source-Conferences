[Education Summit]

With the Raspberry Pi, it's easy to do physical computing directly
from Python code - rather than usual embedded hardware engineering in
C or Assembler.

In this talk I'll show examples of physical computing projects that
use Python on Raspberry Pi and demonstrate the sort of code  used in
such projects.

Physical computing with Python is very popular in education - as it's
so engaging, and more interesting than printing to the screen.

This will be an informative session with learning possibilities to
give those new to physical computing a change to get started.
