	Yamila Moreno - Learnt lessons in a big Django Project

A Django project, developed for 2 years is a valuable source of
anecdotes and wisdom. This talk is a review on the decissions, about
human and tech, that my team took during the project. I'll point out
the good decissions as well as the bad ones, those which made us learn
"the hard way".

Both good and bad decissions taught us a lot, and here I compile them,
together with a handful of tips which can amuse and, hopefully,
inspire the audience, specially those who are facing for the first
time a big project.
