	Ana Balica - Demystifying Mixins with Django
[EuroPython 2015]
[24 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Mixins are a great way to keep an application decoupled. This talk is
about building mixins and dissecting what's behing the mixin "magic"
and that, in fact, there is no magic involved at all. The main focus
will be on Django framework while digging into mixins. When using
Django class-based views, mixins feel very natural.

**Goal**: by the end of this talk, every developer should be confident
about creating his or her own custom mixins.

**Prerequisites:**
 - basic understanding of OOP principles and their application in Python
 - Django web framework

Generally mixins in Python are pretty straight-forward, easy to create
and use. Nevertheless a lot of developers stay away from them. I think
attendees of this talk will be interested to learn that mixins are not
that complex and their benefit is tremendous.
