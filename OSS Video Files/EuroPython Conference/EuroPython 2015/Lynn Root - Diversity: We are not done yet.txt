Description: 
	Lynn Root - Diversity: We are not done yet
[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]

The past few years, we have made large strides to welcome more diverse
people into our community.  You see better gender ratios in attendance
numbers at Python conferences, the billed speakers, the amount of
women-centric programs.  We can see the benefits of outreach.  But
we're not done yet.

While a lot of the Python community embraces the importance of being
diverse, we haven't taken that mindset to our workplace.  From
recruiting, we still hear, "sure, we wanted to recruit women, but we
couldn't find them" and "we only focus on quality here, not gender!"
Within company cultures, we hear "gender equality isn't a problem
here!" or "women don't ask for a higher salary" and to "just lean in!"

This talk will recount the diversity efforts of the past few years and
quantify the effects on the Python community.  But this talk will also
address the not-so-low-hanging fruit; the  deeper-rooted problems that
still plague the community from inside where we work.  And it will
talk the audience through actionable items to improve one's work place
that welcomes more diversity.

hey folks I am a little over-caffeinated

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,650
because I get like four hours of sleep

00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:19,170
broken up so bear with me I'm a little

00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:21,900
bit shaky yes good morning so I'm going

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,710
to like expose myself as a geek a little

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,349
bit last week I actually went to my

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,199
local symphony and they played the full

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:34,670
score of Star Trek to the star trek

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,800
movie the 2009 one it's freaking amazing

00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,390
but it reminded me i don't know if you

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,640
know who Gene Roddenberry is but he's

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,610
the creator producer whatever of the

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,370
Star Trek TV series and he had a few

00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,110
good comments about that's really

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,020
relevant to diversity so I kind of want

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:55,649
to start off with one since I'm so in

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,739
the mood of Star Trek right now so one

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:03,149
obstacle to adulthood needs to be solved

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,949
immediately we must learn not just to

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,549
accept the differences between ourselves

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:12,299
and our ideas but too enthusiastically

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,880
welcomed and enjoy them diversity

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,670
contains as many treasures as those

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,200
waiting for us in other worlds and we

00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,509
will find it impossible to fear

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,360
diversity and to enter into the future

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:29,970
at the same time so it's very comfort

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,729
very comforting to hear someone that's

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,829
so prominent in the geek culture to say

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,829
something like this right I actually

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,009
grew up with my father always watching

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:45,680
reruns of Star Trek I think my favorite

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:45,680
is next generation but

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,420
did not expect that but my father you

00:01:52,189 --> 00:01:55,460
probably no one here knows of them

00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:59,060
because in Seattle beg he's like a real

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:01,909
doppelganger for data he actually

00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,140
dressed up as him for one Halloween he

00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,450
couldn't get the black hair dye out

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,520
that's okay but I have a suspicion that

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,440
Star Trek being in the background of my

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,200
adolescence like it really shaped me

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,390
when I was growing up looking at the TV

00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,209
series as an adult they were very

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,880
diplomatic the characters had very

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:22,819
altruistic views and they applied to

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,769
them to very difficult situations I mean

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,810
the whole premise of the Starfleet right

00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,840
was to was purely humanitarian and

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:31,880
peacekeeping efforts on the series

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,819
itself was used to reflect at occurred

00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:37,910
cultures racism sexism class warfare

00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:40,670
among others Roddenberry himself even

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:43,069
said bye bye creating a new world with

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,069
new rules I can make statements about

00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:48,709
sex religion Vietnam politics and

00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:50,390
intercontinental missiles it was very

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:53,600
novel to have a show like this in the

00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:56,870
60s right so I've added myself as a

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,390
Trekkie but a little bit more about me I

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,660
am a backend engineer for Spotify I'm

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:06,560
based in San Francisco i'm also a vice

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,290
chair of the psf and with Naomi and I

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,859
lead the San Francisco pi ladies as well

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,889
as a lot of the global pi ladies efforts

00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:18,019
so perhaps you're new to python or maybe

00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,389
this is your first Python conference but

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:22,220
to get everyone up to speed past few

00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:25,850
years there's been a huge movement for

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:28,250
to improve the communitys diversity four

00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,100
years ago or four pite of your Python

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:35,840
years your Python conferences ago three

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:39,530
years ago in 2012 basically I am I gave

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,060
a keynote as a complete Python noob like

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,910
I had just started to learn Python and

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,769
how is working to help increase the

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,870
amount of women within the Python

00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,989
community and so I only found it

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,880
appropriate to give an update so I do

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,700
want to know that this talk is mainly

00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,370
focused on women because that's what I'm

00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,190
closely familiar with but the ideals and

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,660
the premise should be

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:02,100
translated to other mind if like other

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,660
minority groups within the Python

00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,770
community and with the tech community as

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:10,110
a whole so also am please like sit back

00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:12,330
close your computers I have a link to

00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,350
everything at the end so I'd really just

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:19,590
love you to like enjoy so to give you

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,340
some context and I could try to explain

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,180
why something like this is important but

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,340
actually did some research and there's

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,010
some really great quotes that I want to

00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,860
share instead so the first one from

00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:33,630
Harvard Business Review there is little

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,700
correlation between a groups collective

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,100
intelligence and the IQs of its

00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,350
individual members but if a group

00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,240
includes more women its collective

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:47,180
intelligence prizes the next one from

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,960
the National Academy of Engineering

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,330
creativity depends on our life

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,190
experiences without diversity the life

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:56,250
experiences we bring to an engineering

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,810
problem are limited as a consequence we

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,910
might not find the best engineering

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:04,950
solution and from scientific american

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,140
when groups of intelligent individuals

00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,480
are working to solve hard problems the

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:11,970
diversity of the problem solvers matter

00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,040
more than their individual ability thus

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:16,410
diversity is not distinct from enhancing

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,040
overall quality it is interval into

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:22,620
achieving it another one from the same

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,840
article and chronic and woeful under

00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,600
under representation of a workforce

00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,940
leads to the inescapable conclusion that

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,220
we are missing critical contributors to

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,290
our talent pool it is hard to grow a

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,540
workforce let alone the best workforce

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:39,570
when there's broad under-representation

00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:43,560
of up to 75 percent of the potential

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:45,290
talent pool one last one from a

00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,640
different Harvard Business Review case

00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,220
after ten years of work experience

00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,080
forty-one percent of women in tech leave

00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,570
the industry compared to seventeen

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,730
percent of men but they are not more

00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,360
likely to leave than the women in other

00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:01,650
industries because of having families

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,590
now when you look at the actual data

00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:07,050
numbers help a lot you can see the lack

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,510
of women across tech fields across the

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,400
board now I want you to take note of

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,760
this group that I actually chose myself

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,560
that yeah

00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,170
who is the only one that allows

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,430
employees to self-report not identifying

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:23,800
as male or female I mentioned earlier

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,080
that there's been a large initiative

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,600
within Python community to increase

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:32,560
diversity so what exactly have we been

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,880
doing mentioned I was on the board I've

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,310
been on the board for the past two years

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,350
and this is my third term in those years

00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:40,330
I've seen a large influx of grant

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:43,060
requests that specifically target

00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:45,130
diversity initiatives just a month ago

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,160
and we approve three Django girls

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,900
funding requests to grants to pie con UK

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,730
that's specifically target kids and

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,620
teachers to get to the conference and

00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,390
two grants for workshops and low

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,820
economic areas or areas that would

00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,300
otherwise have difficulty accessing a

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,540
computer resources and just from some

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,770
quick back of the envelope calculations

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,930
so jhangir girls I guess today is

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,720
celebrating their one-year anniversary

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,880
that's awesome and within that one year

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,870
we've given 19 grants event tolling over

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:19,660
22,000 dollars we're also try to be a

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,120
bit more introspective as well this past

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,980
elections I'm maybe you're on the psf

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,410
members list we made a call out to the

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,300
members pleading to take diversity

00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,430
diversity into consideration for

00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,250
nominating and voting for the new board

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,800
and because of those efforts out of 11

00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:39,600
directors we now have seven women up

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,600
from three this past term

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,310
alright so within pythons centric

00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:52,340
conference network you may have noticed

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,800
an influx of code of conduct there's

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:57,020
definitely a loud opinion that seems to

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,290
think code of conducts are not needed

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,020
for conferences yet a COC is not for

00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:05,090
those folks right those those most

00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:07,699
likely to be affected by harassment or

00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:09,860
assaulting behavior are often the

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,590
minority in the event less likely to be

00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,260
visible there's even a timeline of

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,610
events on the geek feminism wiki I think

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:22,070
and it's not exhaustive but it collects

00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:25,699
actively maintaining incidences so to

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:28,990
show you that these do happen and when

00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:31,250
we do we as a community need to show

00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,409
show those that are affected that we

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,339
care and support them though we want

00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:38,810
them to be here and to feel safe and

00:08:36,339 --> 00:08:40,940
relatedly as of november two thousand

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,580
twelve the python software foundation

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,890
passed an initiative that states it will

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:50,240
only sponsor conferences that have a

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:53,209
code of conduct in place as well in the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,680
past few years commences have been

00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:57,110
organizing or supporting women only

00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,000
events including pi ladies lunches

00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:02,390
genuine girls to Torrio's women only

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,779
cocktail hours and the like I've led a

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:08,779
few of these myself and at the annual

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,570
pilotes lunch at PyCon North America I

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,700
get like poll women up on our little

00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:15,680
stage to talk about themselves what

00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,750
talks are giving the posters tutorial

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,110
sessions lightning talks whatever to

00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:23,089
talk about themselves and women we may

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,550
be a bit embarrassed to talk about

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:28,040
ourselves so having a form that

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,650
explicitly Dean's okay and encourages

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:33,230
them does have a tremendous effect on

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,540
confidence I've heard regular praise

00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:40,370
that it's super awesome to be in a room

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:42,620
full of smart inspiring woman so I think

00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:44,360
you were this yesterday and get awarded

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,830
python is for girls shirt we're all

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,959
familiar with that t-shirt because he

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,220
wears it so often I'm surprised I'm

00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,420
surprised there's not like more coffee

00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,050
stains and holes in it

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,270
but having the creator of Python talk

00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,890
publicly about the need for diversity

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,930
within the community a community that

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,560
wouldn't exist without him has had a

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,390
significant impact I am so very lucky

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,470
that he lives in the bay area and I

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:13,080
certainly abuses close proximity I I

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,590
first met him 2012 I called emailed him

00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:19,740
invited him into to start off a study

00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:21,630
group for women to wine Python and of

00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,450
course you wore that python is for girls

00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:27,180
shirt because he always does but since

00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:31,410
then he's been a regular speaker for

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,730
pilot ease of San Francisco let's see if

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,250
you take a look at other communities

00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:38,930
though you can see a lack of support

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,910
from leadership it really affecting them

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:45,600
like the Linux community I don't have to

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:49,590
say much I'm sure but Linus himself has

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,320
said quote all that diversity stuff is

00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:54,150
just details and not really important

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,000
it's also well known that flame wars are

00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:59,490
a part of the community and therefore

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,510
leadership and the tone that they said

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:06,030
it has to affect the diversity maked

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:09,330
4.4% of when our a bone to a community

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:12,540
or women and 1.8 of the developer of the

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,760
Debian developer community or women I'm

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,260
looking at the Ruby community and you

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,470
can even see a lack of leadership

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,390
support there as well a conference a

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,470
conversation in response to Ruby conf

00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:27,420
announcing their 2013 talk line up and

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,460
they pointed out that they have a lack

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,820
of diversity in their talk lineup and

00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,580
matts the creator of Ruby said in

00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:37,890
response to that giving bias to minority

00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:40,710
does not solve the problem it creates

00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:43,350
reverse discrimination Ruby centric

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:46,650
conferences have been public about their

00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,990
lack of speaker diversity one even

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,540
canceled their conference over it and

00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:55,020
one very well-known outspoken rubik

00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,730
developer ash Dryden she once tweeted

00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,920
that she's continually impressed by the

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,900
Python community and she's not even a

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,940
Python community member or she doesn't

00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,890
think that she is but she is

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,650
the Ruby community certainly has done a

00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,390
lot of work for gender diversity within

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,480
the community including including rails

00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:16,580
girls railsbridge and similar things and

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,100
the fact that these conversations over

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,490
speaker diversity says that the efforts

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:25,010
are taking place or taken effect I can't

00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:27,320
help imagine that if matts was more

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:28,970
supportive of the movement or even if

00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,770
they had a similar organization behind

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:34,070
the Ruby language that we do with the

00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:37,670
psf supporting diversity it may be a

00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:39,860
little bit better now something that I'm

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:43,420
deeply involved with PI ladies it

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:47,540
started in 2012 mid-2012 in Los Angeles

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:48,800
with a few women Python developers they

00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:51,380
essentially said wouldn't this be

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,220
awesome if we got together regularly and

00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:58,820
it really is I'm so from there pilot has

00:12:55,220 --> 00:13:00,800
expanded to over 70 locations each year

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:03,020
we raised tens of thousands of dollars

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,130
to send women to PyCon of north america

00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:08,660
and of those 70 locations 44 and meet up

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:12,130
so I can use the meat of APL and get all

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:15,200
the information and so we have over

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:17,330
12,000 members and we hold regular

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,430
events including beginners workshops

00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,530
Chopra poles of brainstorming conference

00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,450
speaking preparation speaking

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,540
preparation Sprint's hack nights

00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:28,880
coughing code lots of events I didn't

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:32,600
found some fellow knitters through hi

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,910
ladies but but I use the meetup API to

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,850
kind of have you some data mining on

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:40,370
these 44 meetup groups that are pilot

00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,590
ease so I was able to get the amount of

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,050
new pilot is joining every month so this

00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:48,020
represents every month how many new

00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,210
members have actually joined and I was

00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,570
super scientific linear regression right

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:55,010
here just slapped an arrow okay you can

00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:58,310
definitely see like a linear trend going

00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:01,400
up month over month and taking this into

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,050
context you can see the annual Pikkon

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,510
and North America may have some effect

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:08,500
on inspiring folks joining pie ladies

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:11,150
with those immediate spikes right after

00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:13,280
and then you can see some effect when

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,200
actually looking at the largest 17

00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,740
chapters i don't know why i chose 17 but

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,810
i did

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,780
um but you can see some kind of spikes

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:24,320
right after and some of them started and

00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,180
so what's the effect of pie ladies so a

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,130
bit of a forewarning I am NOT a

00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:32,780
statistician I like to play one on stage

00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:37,190
so bear with me humor me for pie con

00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:39,350
2013 or sin spike in 2013 pi ladies has

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,630
held workshops for women to help

00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,910
brainstorm talk proposals with the help

00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,530
of past committee members as well as

00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:48,080
give them an opportunity to practice

00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:51,710
their talks once they're accepted we've

00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:53,960
been doing that since our 4 2013 14 15

00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:55,970
and I'm sure you can relate to this

00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:58,130
perhaps we've all wanted to propose a

00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,660
talk somewhere and you're like I have

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,300
the month to go I'll just I'll just

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:04,130
write it later but then suddenly the

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,260
deadlines passed so having like a

00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:08,180
dedicated time like really helps but I

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,400
found that a lot of pilots do want to

00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:14,480
talk but they don't have an idea about

00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,550
what topic to speak on or actually they

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,150
do have an idea but they don't think

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:21,730
it's that great of an idea so having a

00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,170
sounding board of other women

00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:26,060
accompanying by people who selected

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:27,830
talks for pike on the pass really have

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,830
given women confidence to submit a

00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,930
proposal so then the talks get accepted

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,490
and we all know when they accepted you

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,830
have that oh moment I have to

00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,660
prepare but it's really confidence

00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:41,260
boosting right you have a group of your

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,990
peers that selected you and your idea to

00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,370
a lot you time you specifically to speed

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,070
we want to hear you and so it's a

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,440
brilliant feeling so I'd like to think

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:53,240
that giving that resource and time to PI

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,900
ladies has had an effect on the

00:15:53,240 --> 00:16:00,230
percentage of the speakers at PyCon on a

00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:03,590
more regional level I took three cities

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,180
um I looked at their meetup presence

00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:07,580
there python meetup presence i looked at

00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,260
New York Boston in San Francisco to see

00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,620
if the community reflects any difference

00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:14,410
with the addition of Pi ladies so this

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,840
graph it shows a number of new members

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,890
every month for 42 main meet up to New

00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:23,240
York and the NYC python and django NYC

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,330
so certainly some of those these

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,830
communities growth is attributable to

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:31,320
the popularity of Python language

00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,060
overall as well as the growth of the

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:36,600
startup scene in New York over that time

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,960
line but when we see pie ladies that

00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:42,750
started mid-2012 for New York the

00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,970
respective meet its saw sharper growth

00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:49,530
of new members and my super scientific

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:52,920
like linear regression stuff so moving

00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:55,920
to Boston Boston is also a great hub for

00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:59,070
Python and I has a very active django

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,960
meetup in Python user group however we

00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:03,360
don't see much difference at least

00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,880
within the Python user group in the

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,050
growth of new members after pilot ease

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,690
Boston started but perhaps you're

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:15,030
familiar some of Pi ladies inspiration

00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:17,610
actually came from the lemon only

00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:20,430
workshops that Boston Python user groups

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:23,760
started back in early 2011 so you can

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:27,630
see a large growth rate once the region

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,790
introduced a woman focused events all

00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:32,190
right onto san francisco my home and

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:35,610
home of the largest pi ladies location

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:38,490
i'm sure no coincidence we have a bunch

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,150
of Python centric meetup groups and i

00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:46,020
chose most active largest ones that were

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:48,000
around when Pylos SF started so that

00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,860
growth rate of the membership of these

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,710
might these meetup groups can be pretty

00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,110
noticeable when we started in april 2012

00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:57,840
and again super scientific linear

00:17:55,110 --> 00:18:00,030
regression but what I saw what's

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,480
interesting is when switching this graph

00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,850
to a line graph you can see that when PI

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,460
ladies in SF started that the rate of

00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:11,940
new membership specifically for SF

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:14,040
Python pub night meetup was not affected

00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,680
at all and I suspect it has something to

00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:19,710
do with the promise of the presence of

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:23,280
alcohol or the environment that might

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:25,530
not trap attract bye ladies anyways this

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,960
is just me trying to quantify the

00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:30,690
regional effective pi ladies on local

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,870
meetups if you want the data I have a

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:37,020
lot of data once i get a breather i will

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:40,710
publish the ipython notebooks on on my

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,450
blog which i will link at the end all

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,390
right so we're doing pretty good maybe

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,760
but we're not done yet there is so much

00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:50,220
more to do and more than just throwing

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,870
money at PI ladies but please continue

00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:57,330
giving us money so a lot of people

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,990
recruiters and developers alike come to

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:02,460
me to complain about not hiring women or

00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,130
about the lack of their corporate

00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,900
diversity in general I've heard the same

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,210
excuses all the time and trying to hire

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,010
more diversely I couldn't find them or

00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,800
where a meritocracy Jenner doesn't

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:16,110
matter but i'm going to introduce a

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:20,100
super slick scientific term maybe you've

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,860
heard it it's these excuses are

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,570
 and I'm going to show you why

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,510
gender equality and that's not a problem

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:29,220
here because things don't matter what

00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:32,220
you're actually saying is it's not a

00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,840
problem for me and this really shouldn't

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:37,200
be said anymore and it essentially

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,330
questions the person's belief it's if

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,280
it's someone's concerned to increase the

00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:43,530
gender ratio it should be treated as a

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,730
legitimate problem if you think if you

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,340
don't think it's a problem then ask

00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,440
questions oh really how so what what do

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,850
you think could be done trying to

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,800
understand why it's a problem because

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:57,420
why else would someone say something

00:19:52,800 --> 00:20:00,270
about it another classic one we focus on

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:05,100
quality not gender or the similar excuse

00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:06,630
we are meritocracy that's what

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,940
you're saying to me is you find a

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:12,240
quality to mean software written by men

00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,910
but the quality quality is not an

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,280
objective word do we encourage bug free

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,140
code test coverage elegant and

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,750
simplistic code what other values do we

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,160
add to quality so this excuse is

00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,610
essentially saying we don't want to

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,650
change what we're doing here all right

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,370
so I've heard this one for girls to

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:34,610
women aren't interested in this and

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:38,580
that's implying that it's women's fault

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:43,030
are they really not that interested that

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:47,990
is complete yes thank you

00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:49,640
okay you're listening so at spotify and

00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,310
we participated on an event called

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:54,110
Thecla it was meant for secondary school

00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:56,000
girls where I'm sponsoring companies

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,700
held workshops to give a sampling of

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,860
what future and what the future has the

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,320
offer for technology so it included like

00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,260
robots computers 3d printing awesomely

00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,270
geeky things and it proved that it is

00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,010
something girls are interested in we had

00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:12,980
so many people there at the event

00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:16,220
crowded like the max amount of seeds

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,320
were taken and so to prove that girls

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,270
are interested in stuff like this and so

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,310
long as they're invited right and PI

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,230
ladies is proof of that too it proves

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:25,760
that an invitation for what m for women

00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:30,230
to join the Python community actually

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,920
works in the classic I hear they're so

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:36,230
often we couldn't find the women's yet

00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:40,820
what I actually hear is you don't put

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:44,320
enough effort into it I put a single job

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:48,440
at once for Spotify to my local pilot

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:52,220
mailing list and I got 40 responses from

00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,780
women and i'm not i'm not sure if or

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,160
there's more than 200 people on that

00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,770
mailing list so that's a super awesome

00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,170
response rate so i challenge folks to

00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:02,810
take a look at your own professional

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:04,820
network for instance linkedin how

00:22:02,810 --> 00:22:06,050
diverse are your connections and how

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,900
many people look like you and how many

00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:11,030
people don't and if you reach out to the

00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,150
same network of yours you're only going

00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:16,280
to get to the same people applying i

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:20,300
will take work but the women's are out

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,030
there this one I see this one a lot

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:26,180
unlike Twitter and reddit kotas are bad

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:29,240
reverse discrimination and that is

00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:31,310
 what it sounds to me is that

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,490
you just want to your friends who I'm

00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:37,040
sure look like you it doesn't help that

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,920
we have a referral bonus culture that

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,110
encourages us to hire our friends and I

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:46,340
get the reason why hire good people like

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:48,620
you but that has consequences so what if

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:51,250
we turn it around and said okay let's be

00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:53,960
sure to hire ninety percent white men

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,000
there's this incorrect thinking that

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,950
there's some sacrifice to be made

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,860
that you are lowering your standards but

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:02,480
that's I just quoted a bunch of

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,510
recent research in the beginning that

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,970
proves the opposite so we have all seen

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,280
I'm sure we all seen studies that when

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:12,260
removing gender identifies from resumes

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,050
more women get through the recruitment

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,810
process so you need to make sure that

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:20,810
everyone that is qualified is being

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:25,180
considered so yeah lowering standards

00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:28,430
that's you can say it with me

00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,080
all right so yes tech hire a tech

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:32,630
industry is hiring like crazy we need

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,210
more does now like whoa and I kind of

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:37,550
get it but what this means is that you

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,710
don't actually care enough to put fought

00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:43,010
and about your diversity in your hiring

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,140
process and it's as simple as that do

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,370
the work once to ensure that you have

00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:49,730
the appropriate practices in place

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:52,550
diverse networks maybe and remove gender

00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,620
identifying words in your application

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:56,690
process it certainly doesn't take much

00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,800
effort to google for local communities

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:04,760
to reach out to so basically what this

00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:06,500
is is all thinly veiled and I'm

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,240
sure I'm not the only one to pick up on

00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:14,210
it either but and this hints at a larger

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,050
ischium the fallacy that there's a bad

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:20,330
guy and certainly you get why Deborah

00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,430
scenes is important and we see so many

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:24,350
tries something feel trying and with all

00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,450
those excuses there's a notion that

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,880
there is a bad guy behind the lack of

00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,460
diversity in tech a lot of attention is

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,080
given to someone who says something bad

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,100
and everyone's like aha there's the bad

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:39,380
guy let's go get them but Burt we didn't

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:42,380
get here because of blind bad guy we're

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:44,930
all the bad guy we're all complacent we

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:47,210
hire our friends we have uniform looking

00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:49,730
networks this is something that everyone

00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:53,420
has to consciously and actively work

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:56,300
towards so there's a lot of

00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,250
right perhaps you agree a lot of thinly

00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:02,510
veiled and that we need to do

00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:04,990
more so what can we do you've heard of

00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:07,070
google right

00:25:04,990 --> 00:25:10,280
numerous of times people come to me to

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,810
educate them I'm not your teacher yeah I

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,490
speak a lot about it but I'm luck I'm

00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,380
not gonna hold your hand if you want to

00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:17,330
learn more about feminism unconscious

00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,620
bias about privilege that's that's super

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,810
fantastic and I want to give like two

00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:23,180
thumbs up but I'm not going to do the

00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:26,450
work for you I don't have time for that

00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:29,110
nor the patient that that comes that is

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,740
needed for the debates that come with it

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:35,510
i'm also not your network for women

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,450
there are mailing lists meetups events

00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,820
go to go to them join them i reach out

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,950
get your engineers involved right build

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,980
those relationships but i will not do

00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:49,300
your leg work for you use google it's a

00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:53,570
fantastic untapped resource I promise

00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:56,150
but for this one time only I have I've

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:58,610
actually made a set of readings but I

00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:00,680
want you to memorize this link I'll show

00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,420
it at the end again but but I've

00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:06,800
collected a lot of resources to help

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:09,320
kind of kick start learning process all

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,660
right so after some self education some

00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,930
googling hopefully there are micro

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,760
actions that we all can take first is

00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,940
super simple programmer should like it

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,610
switch any use of the word female to

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:26,570
women for example female attendees to

00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:27,980
women attendees and why may you ask the

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,890
first reason is they mean different

00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:34,420
things female is a scientific term for

00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:37,910
the reverse ability to produce offspring

00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:42,020
the term woman refers to human while

00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:44,240
female refers to any species the second

00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,730
reason it's quite dehumanizing to be

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,760
reduced to my reproductive abilities and

00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,980
to ignore the nonhuman you also exclude

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,870
folks that while identify as a woman may

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,360
not have the physical ability to bear

00:26:53,870 --> 00:27:00,950
children not all women are biologically

00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:04,130
female when used as a noun it can imply

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,180
inferiority I'm so often use when used

00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:07,430
as a noun it's often used with a

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,490
negative tone for instance I made the

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:12,710
mistake of searching on twitter and i

00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:14,360
found a quote female should stop wearing

00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,990
makeup so we all know the truth or I

00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,390
can't trust females anymore so

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,540
with the use of the word females we are

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:27,380
reduced to a species we are separate we

00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,730
are other you you can see you can see

00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:31,250
what I mean if you go on Twitter but

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:34,160
please take some wine with you before

00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:37,010
you start on Twitter and you don't

00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:41,059
really see any people referring to males

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:43,100
right so along those lines I really want

00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,620
you to think that like if you need a

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,650
gendered identifier more often than not

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:52,340
you probably don't for instance at work

00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:55,820
I get introduced a lot as this is lem

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:58,460
she's our female developer there's no

00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:02,290
need for that there's already a word for

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:05,720
for what I am I'm a engineer I

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:07,550
might be crappy I might be lazy stubborn

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,650
you can call me that it's fine but

00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:12,260
please I'm not a female or a woman

00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,900
developer only when gender is really

00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,809
relevant should use you specify like an

00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,880
event specifically for women another

00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:22,340
example just happened last week so I had

00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,620
to include it i received a recruitment

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,790
spam on linkedin even though i had like

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,340
this big banner saying please don't

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:30,500
contact me for jobs and the recruiter

00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,120
said this i'm really impressed with your

00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,510
profile and I'm especially impressed

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:40,370
because you're a woman just like like

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:44,090
facepalm like yeah anyways another my

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:45,890
garage action assume knowledge assume

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,450
that everyone has a reason to be at this

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,050
conference at this meet about this

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,190
workshop whatever no one's a plus one

00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:53,960
they're not a beginner they're not a

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,390
recruiter until they tell you so right

00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,220
assume allow them to reveal whatever

00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,140
they is that they want to but assume the

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:04,429
reason for attending is the same as

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:06,350
yours this will probably sound better if

00:29:04,429 --> 00:29:08,510
it was female first design for the

00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,240
alliteration but there's no other reason

00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:17,570
than for the alliteration so women first

00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:20,570
design I love this so make the default

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:22,640
pronouns and imagery and reflect a woman

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:24,710
so all your documentation or products

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,929
that you make user profiles form default

00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,549
values whatever the reason that this is

00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:31,739
so impactful is that it's signaling

00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:34,169
signals to women that as a developer

00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:36,299
you've thought about them it does not

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,249
mean patronizing women by painting

00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:41,999
flowers across your product or making

00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:44,820
like pink everywhere and i doubt that

00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:47,929
Apple considered how women would react

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,190
when they first introduced the ipad I

00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:53,580
don't know if it's American thing but a

00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:57,659
pad means like a sanitary napkin so that

00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:59,999
was my first instinct anyways the last

00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:02,549
micro action this is a novel thing I

00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:04,679
know but reach out a couple months ago

00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:07,499
Donald stuff one of them the maintainer

00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:10,499
zuv pypy I'm he pinged me on IRC he

00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:13,919
asked for help for 4 pi PI both with a

00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:16,169
maintenance / bug fixing as well as more

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,499
greenfield projects and he actually

00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:23,429
thought that he recognized there were no

00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:26,639
women in pi PI behind the scenes so he

00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:30,269
wanted to fix that so get this he asked

00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:33,179
us he asked Pilate to help alleviate the

00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:35,039
workload to tip and to be honest um

00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:38,220
Donald didn't really think that he would

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,230
get many responses but his disbelief and

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,090
I knew this would happen he got four

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:44,909
volunteers within the first hour of that

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,929
email so this actually works I know

00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:51,779
it's mind-blowing I know but it works

00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:53,489
alright so my Corrections are for the

00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,529
low hanging fruit of small actions that

00:30:53,489 --> 00:30:57,570
we can all do to really help welcome

00:30:55,529 --> 00:31:02,129
women and de Python but now on to the

00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:04,799
more difficult it difficult it's

00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:06,809
very comfortable hiring working with

00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,259
hanging out with our co-founding

00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:12,480
businesses with people like you but we

00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:16,230
must be prepared to be uncomfortable and

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,649
one way to take one take on this is like

00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:22,139
intentional curiosity so remember that

00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:25,619
let me google that for you then I hope

00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:27,629
you remember well I find it annoying it

00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,899
is indeed commendable to want to educate

00:31:27,629 --> 00:31:32,730
yourself but it actually takes work and

00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:35,639
again I'm not going to do it for you but

00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,499
self education is the key and so yeah

00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:39,929
one thing that's very admire balazs

00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:42,600
curiosity curiosity when meeting people

00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:45,510
not like yourself within social

00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:48,179
places whatever curiosity about what

00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:50,880
makes a team work well together how to

00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:53,549
make that team better and essentially

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,270
going beyond your comfort zone another

00:31:53,549 --> 00:31:58,620
point technologies technology companies

00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,870
have been super good at being

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,400
introspective it's certainly

00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,950
embarrassing uncomfortable to admit

00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:07,410
mistakes and fuck-ups right if a service

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,929
goes down though a company is often a

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:12,390
very transparent and apologetic to it we

00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:14,580
tend to share what we learn but there

00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,580
isn't that same transparency among the

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:20,280
lack of diversity we should have post

00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,650
mortems on the subject like here where

00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,960
our numbers for 2010 here's what we're

00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:27,360
doing and here's where we're where we

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,669
are now now we need to reflect on

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,789
diversity as a similar problem when a

00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:35,039
service goes down or our fail whale and

00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,500
then document it for the world open

00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:39,600
source our diversity and it's definitely

00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,990
scary it's definitely it's not

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,210
comfortable to admit fault but but it

00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:46,559
certainly be awesome to see that see

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,380
what companies are doing how they're

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,500
doing it so we can learn from them the

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,570
last bit if you for the women here if

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,460
you're the only woman in the room say

00:32:54,570 --> 00:33:00,539
what you really think and I mean that

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,460
seriously I spent a few meetings at work

00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:04,289
noticing how often I would be

00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,140
interrupted acknowledged unacknowledged

00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:09,750
or just talked over and cod Emma it

00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:12,000
really made me mad with this one reading

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,520
in particular i was actually leading it

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,140
I was being perpetually talked over and

00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:18,179
interrupted and I just got fed up and I

00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:20,549
literally said for sake let me

00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:24,419
 speak and it felt really good

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:25,919
and they just it just like shut up but

00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:28,710
in all honesty he's like say what you

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,990
think rage quit the meeting if you have

00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:34,020
to because otherwise it will continue

00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:36,059
and it will probably get worse I mean

00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,309
your company may be super into diversity

00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,080
but if you don't have a voice at

00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:44,400
the table what is the point

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,440
right all right so enough swearing this

00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,690
talk is turning into a bit of a rage

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,900
induce monologue I'm sorry but I wanted

00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,820
to finish on a positive note so from the

00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:57,360
Star Trek philosophy do

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,550
run Barry he says humanity will reach

00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,160
maturity and wisdom on the day that it

00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:04,050
begins not just to tolerate but to take

00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,770
special delight and the differences in

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:09,570
ideas and differences in life forms the

00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,940
worst possible thing that can happen to

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:14,580
all of us is for the future to somehow

00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,490
press us into a common mold where we

00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,670
begin to act and talk and look and think

00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:23,580
alike if we cannot learn to actually

00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,990
enjoy those small differences to take

00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,060
positive delight in those small

00:34:24,990 --> 00:34:29,490
differences between our own kind here on

00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,230
this planet then we do not deserve to go

00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:35,070
out into space and meet the diversity

00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:37,220
that is almost certainly out there thank

00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:37,220
you

00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:49,069
Thank You Lynn Thank You Lynn we still

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,780
have time for possibly one or two

00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:57,380
questions anyone if you're too shy we

00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:59,780
can go out for wine hi we had a recently

00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:03,140
discussion about ladies in France and

00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,390
the problem is that some people say as

00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,359
you said it's but that here

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,460
about reverse discrimination and we

00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:13,339
haven't found way to explain them but

00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,920
that's not discrimination per se it's

00:35:13,339 --> 00:35:19,010
more about bringing people you have

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,329
example to convince such people that

00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:25,069
it's not something we should exclude

00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:27,020
right well I mean the whole industry has

00:35:25,069 --> 00:35:27,890
been exclusive exclusionary to begin

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,000
with right and that's what we're doing

00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:33,530
to counteract that so they're only

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,349
propagating being exclusionary when they

00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:40,339
don't allow like like groups like pie

00:35:36,349 --> 00:35:42,440
ladies but I would suggest going like

00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:44,119
I'll be let me google that for you like

00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:48,410
I actually have a couple really good

00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:50,810
like articles but I often sin and a lot

00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,550
of pilot is often send to people that

00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:55,339
have that reaction to help kind of

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:57,349
convert them maybe maybe confer is not

00:35:55,339 --> 00:35:59,630
the right word but can i push them over

00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:01,970
the edge to accept us but but yeah i

00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,819
encouraged to find that those resources

00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:08,630
that that i linked through this link

00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:16,790
that makes sense yeah awesome ok the

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:18,710
last question it's kind of the same

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:22,010
question because i'm organizing pie

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,950
ladies Paris so what did you why do you

00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:27,650
want what do you recommend if the

00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:30,079
Association the most important

00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:32,630
association of Python in France this

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:36,200
idea that they don't want to change do

00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:38,240
do you do anything like I'm tired of

00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,900
explaining to the end and why it's

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,940
important so do you think that just let

00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,839
them on the road and hit the motive

00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:51,050
motorbike and yeah well like I mean you

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,540
can only talk to a wall for like so long

00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:55,559
right so if if they're going to like not

00:36:53,540 --> 00:37:01,769
listen then them right

00:36:55,559 --> 00:37:03,749
I mean this but this is not something

00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:05,969
new like other pie ladies have have

00:37:03,749 --> 00:37:07,559
encountered this and I can connect you
