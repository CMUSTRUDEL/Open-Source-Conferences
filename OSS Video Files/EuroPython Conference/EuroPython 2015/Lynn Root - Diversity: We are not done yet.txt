	Lynn Root - Diversity: We are not done yet
[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]

The past few years, we have made large strides to welcome more diverse
people into our community.  You see better gender ratios in attendance
numbers at Python conferences, the billed speakers, the amount of
women-centric programs.  We can see the benefits of outreach.  But
we're not done yet.

While a lot of the Python community embraces the importance of being
diverse, we haven't taken that mindset to our workplace.  From
recruiting, we still hear, "sure, we wanted to recruit women, but we
couldn't find them" and "we only focus on quality here, not gender!"
Within company cultures, we hear "gender equality isn't a problem
here!" or "women don't ask for a higher salary" and to "just lean in!"

This talk will recount the diversity efforts of the past few years and
quantify the effects on the Python community.  But this talk will also
address the not-so-low-hanging fruit; the  deeper-rooted problems that
still plague the community from inside where we work.  And it will
talk the audience through actionable items to improve one's work place
that welcomes more diversity.
