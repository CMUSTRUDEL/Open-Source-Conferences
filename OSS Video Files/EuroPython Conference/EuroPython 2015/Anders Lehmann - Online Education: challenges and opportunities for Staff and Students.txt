	Anders Lehmann - Online Education: challenges and opportunities for Staff and Students
[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]
[Education Summit]

From september 2015 Aarhus School of Engineering will offer the
education Bachelor of Electronic Engineering, as a combined online
and on campus education. In the talk I will describe the technical and
pedagogical setup, we are working at to meet the challenges of having
both on-site and remote students.

I will also touch on how IPython Notebook, will be part of the
technical setup, and how it can be incorporated into the teaching.

good afternoon everyone thanks for

00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:08,160
having me so today I am the servant

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:11,429
we've talked about Python in education

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,460
and it seems to be that I'm in the other

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,420
end of the spectrum yes because this is

00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:23,820
University in education so my name is

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:28,680
honest lehman and this is a compact mu

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:32,850
of my 20 years as a abstract engineer so

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:36,930
I have kept the lock and honor to have a

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:42,469
very diverse career I think but now I

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:46,710
work for the University of Oz where I am

00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:54,210
teaching bachelor students in electronic

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:57,270
engineering so the talk that I'm going

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:01,890
to present to you today I'll go through

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:04,350
these items here just short of what what

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:08,220
we're doing now what kind of lead

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:12,360
education we have now and what a little

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,590
bit about how the Danish university

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,680
education look a brief introduction to

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,700
the online in education landscape if you

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:27,540
can call that and then I'll go into more

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:31,170
about what are the challenges for for

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:35,579
education for online education and

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:38,430
mainly what but can we foresee as

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,570
challenges and and how should we address

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,299
those challenges then I'll present what

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,399
we are trying to do in our

00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,509
transformation of the existing education

00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:57,509
and lastly how Python can fit into to

00:01:51,509 --> 00:02:03,210
this a online education of university

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:05,850
education so the existing education that

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:09,910
we have today is we call it electronic

00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:13,380
design engineer it's an accredited

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:18,420
education it takes three and half years

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:22,150
where there is a six-month internship

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:27,550
included we have a very good cooperation

00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:32,020
with the local industry so we are able

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,660
to place almost all our students in in

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:37,870
companies for these six months and it

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,230
tends to be that that after they have

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:44,920
been six months at a company most of

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:48,760
them will write their bachelor thesis at

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:52,270
that company of from the tasks that

00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,450
these companies give them and a large

00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:57,550
percentage of those who have soared

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:00,100
problems from further companies will

00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:04,330
continue in employment at these

00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:07,560
companies the education is located in

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:13,930
hurting which is simplest part of

00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:18,959
Denmark it's not a large city but we are

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:21,160
lucky to have a quite large number of

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,570
industries and some of them are quite a

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:28,090
big the most the blush is one is

00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:32,340
probably Siemens wind power which is

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:37,090
located less than 20 miles from from the

00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:41,440
from the education and of course there's

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:46,080
a lot of of wind power related companies

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,680
that support with vistas and and seams

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,250
which are the mood largest wind power

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:57,630
factories football industries we have so

00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:04,239
it's a kind of exclusive education where

00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:07,650
we have will only accept 40 students it

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:12,330
here so it's kind of it's a small

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:15,520
education so a little bit about

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,979
University of Oz so University of office

00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:20,650
is the largest university in Denmark

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:22,840
even though that always says only the

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,350
second largest city

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:30,660
indelicate over the last five years I

00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:33,100
have been a lot of murders in the Danish

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:40,660
University of Sirius XM serve and

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:43,870
actually well host has has swallowed up

00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:48,370
a large number of smaller campuses among

00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:51,790
them the campus in hurting so in Denmark

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:56,530
the tuition is free on the university

00:04:51,790 --> 00:05:00,010
education and the students will get an

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:04,330
allowance while doing the studies and

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:10,380
they can apply for a low-interest

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:13,479
student loans the the allowance is

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:19,870
almost enough father for the students to

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:23,860
to live off from it it's around 800 800

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:27,940
euros a month but they are also allowed

00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:31,030
to to work that there's a limit for how

00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:38,289
much they can burn in the student jobs

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:40,630
but yeah sometimes when when our

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:46,030
students go abroad and talk about their

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:48,940
the conditions as a student people don't

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,530
believe them but it's actually true and

00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:54,280
I'm but I actually think it's a good

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:57,660
idea I'm happy with this system because

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:02,800
it it allows people to focus on their

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:05,260
education and that's a good thing so of

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:10,330
course we have all heard about these

00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:15,610
online these new guys in the in the

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:18,960
education sector 40 can university of me

00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:23,560
DX and stanford how to everyone and

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:29,770
their mother seems to to have have

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:33,819
offerings in in online education and and

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:36,340
I think that the traditional university

00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:39,159
education are slowly coming around to

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:42,370
seeing that that did there's a need for

00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:48,669
it as a demand for for online education

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:50,710
efforts or offerings so but what we have

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:53,530
seen in Herning of what we were trying

00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,139
to do in here we try to we're not going

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,560
to emulate these offerings we are trying

00:06:56,139 --> 00:07:01,990
to take the best out of them and then

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,430
provided in our setting we want to we

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,669
want our education so still be

00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:10,419
accredited which want our students to be

00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:13,330
able to obtain this allowance so they

00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:16,680
that should be the same level of quality

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:21,250
and control in order to for for for the

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,349
education to still be accredited that's

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,669
very important for us because that's how

00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:30,430
the university gets paid if the

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:33,099
education loses it's a decree

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,169
accreditation we cannot be reimbursed

00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:37,830
for for the work that we are doing so

00:07:35,169 --> 00:07:46,690
it's extremely important that we don't

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:50,430
lose that accreditation so the as we see

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:54,759
it the online offerings that we vc is

00:07:50,430 --> 00:08:00,099
mostly focused on single subject single

00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:03,009
topics a single course eventually maybe

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:07,360
a kind of certification but that can be

00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:11,650
used for to document your skills the way

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:14,560
that they are our sort is through short

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,990
videos explaining topic and then there

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,099
will be some problems that the student

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:24,219
can solve and after each larger section

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:26,889
section there will be some tests either

00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:31,150
that the student will score themselves

00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:33,820
to to to see how they are doing odd i

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,870
will be if there are also offerings

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,539
where the there will be a teacher or a

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,230
system that creates the problem solving

00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:51,970
skills

00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:54,340
students so this is what we see the way

00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:59,170
that the online education is going and

00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:02,290
of course it does a lot of good thing is

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:05,140
into this it's it's nice for for the

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:09,340
student should be able to to study when

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,860
they have the time and the the drive for

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:15,640
it and it's and they can do it at home

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:18,010
and in their own pace but we also see

00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,520
that there are some challenges to this

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:24,820
approach especially if you want to have

00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:31,270
a full-time education based on on online

00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:34,140
offerings we we see a possible change in

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:38,020
how how can we keep the online student

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:42,460
focused how can we avoid the day spend

00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,890
too much time on everything else that

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:50,950
you can do when you sit have in front of

00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:56,350
a computer if if we if we have full time

00:09:50,950 --> 00:10:00,730
students that only doing the study

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:05,650
through online offerings we there is a

00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:09,490
real danger than that the people get

00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:12,940
isolated that they won't they won't feel

00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:17,650
as as if they are part of a larger group

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:21,240
or that they are all alone and stuff

00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:25,360
like that we we actually we're fighting

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:28,510
these things about isolation even though

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,180
that we have campus and we have people

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:34,150
coming through classes even in those

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,730
situation we actually see that are some

00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:41,500
students that that for one or another

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:47,500
reason gets isolated or feel alone so I

00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:49,100
think that's a real issue here also when

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,370
when you are

00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:58,100
when you are what you're doing online

00:10:54,370 --> 00:11:02,210
learning you you are the driver for the

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:07,250
motivation and it's of course so so

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:10,280
online learning will if to some its

00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:13,820
extent favor eyes people who are good at

00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,620
motivating themselves of course it kill

00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:18,350
her well recorded motivate themselves

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,470
also have an advantage in in in

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,570
traditional education but but I don't

00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,890
think that the motivation part is going

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:30,160
to be smaller in online offerings and

00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:33,770
finally there's also some some

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:40,720
challenges for the teaching the faculty

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:43,160
we need to plan differently we need to

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,560
be better to anticipate questions

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,070
because what if there's no the direct

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:56,380
interaction with the students we have to

00:11:49,070 --> 00:12:01,790
prepare in a narrative different way so

00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:04,820
i'll briefly go this is not a talk about

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:08,150
learning theory but i would want to

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,980
emphasize a few things that in the way

00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:15,560
that we look at a teaching and learning

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:20,240
of course if we talk about teaching then

00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,850
the important actor is the teacher so if

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,010
we if we look at education as something

00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,880
that we have to teach then we will focus

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:33,020
on the teacher and maybe that's not the

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,600
most beneficial way to look at that

00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:38,810
education or learning because maybe will

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,850
be the outcome of the teaching should be

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:48,620
that the student learned something also

00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:52,990
when when we as teachers feel that that

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:57,710
our students didn't learn what we have

00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,960
had hoped or planned then we put very

00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:03,990
easily fallen into this

00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,150
trap that that we could just say okay I

00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,990
did everything that I should I planned I

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:13,230
have all these nice problems I have made

00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:17,970
a very good lecture so if they didn't

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:20,910
understand it they must be stupid so and

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,960
that's that's a very dangerous thing to

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:28,200
do I think to begin to look at your the

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,240
student body and divided into groups the

00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:32,670
good students and the best students

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,520
because the good students in it they're

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:39,030
going to too well they're going to

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,460
thrive anyways and if we kind of give up

00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,230
on the past students we shouldn't call

00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:47,010
them that student because they they

00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:51,840
don't exist they I think that we we have

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:53,760
to accept that there are no good student

00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:58,190
at low pass on there are only different

00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,140
ways of learning and if we instead of

00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:06,680
focusing on the teacher at focusing on

00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:09,600
learning so that the outcome of our

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,790
teaching then we will focus on this

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,000
student and we will begin asking

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:18,690
questions like how would you prefer to

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,650
to learn how would you prefer to read or

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:25,200
listen or we look to admit us to problem

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:29,270
solving or what is the best way for you

00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,950
to learn this this topic this topic

00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:36,960
other sometimes that are better than

00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:41,580
other and other of some places where you

00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:45,320
would prefer to to be learning these

00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:51,330
places we can't really ask today because

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:54,810
how is it really determined by the

00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:57,780
teacher when is termed by the classroom

00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:02,820
schedule and where it is that's the on

00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:05,550
campus we can't really change that in

00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:08,100
the traditional settings but we have the

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:11,070
possibility in the online situation that

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:14,420
we have to make we can make more

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:19,279
allowances for computers to choose their

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:24,290
learning environment so as a teacher in

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:29,079
this in this setting our job will be

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:34,160
more to provide the tools and the

00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:40,940
curriculum to allow for the student to

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:43,160
have a learning process so what we're

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,790
going to do in the new education is that

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:51,980
we will we will offer this as an online

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:56,269
this bachelor study as an online an

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:59,149
online study but we will we will kind of

00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:02,570
will try to mix it so there will be both

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:05,300
on campus students and online students

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:08,240
and they can mix and match as I want

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:11,000
some on-campus student can choose to to

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,240
stay at home some days or a week or

00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,529
whatever and some online students can

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:21,079
choose to come to to the campus to

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:24,560
engage with the other students so but we

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:27,410
want one the start I've started to start

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:32,329
with a week-long boot camp where we

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:34,550
gather all the students in either or

00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:37,610
both the online and on-campus student

00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:40,910
should come to this campus so that we

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,800
can set up the computers and form the

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,430
teams that we are will need during the

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,820
study and well introduce them to the

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:53,540
teachers and get a relationship going

00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:58,100
between the students internally but also

00:16:53,540 --> 00:17:04,520
between the students and faculty the

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:06,860
semester we will use this we call it's

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:11,120
not an it's not our invention with the

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:13,400
idea of the flipped classroom that will

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,069
be the main way that we were going to

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,910
teach so we will have that the students

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:23,059
will prepare for for the sessions which

00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,490
we also also will have they will plan by

00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:28,550
looking at videos at home

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:31,640
doing all problems and so there will be

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,309
visual lectures and and they had to

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:39,050
reach stuff and I think that's how they

00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:40,940
prepared for the session the the online

00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,540
sessions or encounter campus session

00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:49,130
where well the weather would be

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:50,809
discussion about what was what was the

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,160
important part of the lessons for today

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:59,420
and there will be problem solving and

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,309
stuff like that and there's a that's

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,929
something that we haven't tried yet we

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:07,550
don't know if it is going to work what

00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:11,420
we want to gather people both online and

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:14,059
on-campus on this a in the same time so

00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:19,520
that people on campus can interact with

00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:22,160
the online students by well the internet

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,620
so a little more about the flipped

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,500
classroom to end the top we have the

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:31,450
traditional class the teacher is going

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:35,210
through the topic for the today and the

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:39,550
students are listening and then they go

00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:42,410
home one by one and and study the

00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:46,000
primarily the text for for the class in

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:49,450
the flipped classroom there will be a

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,390
preparation part where the students

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:55,970
prepare for the lessons at home and then

00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:58,880
when they come to the two lesson the

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:04,250
teacher will be more a facilitator than

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:08,679
a lecturer and the students will engage

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:13,429
with the topics and with each other so

00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:16,520
that they they use the preparation in

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:18,770
the classroom and they can use the

00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,929
discussions between the students to to

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,890
further improve their learning that's

00:19:20,929 --> 00:19:27,740
the idea will as I said it's not our

00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:32,450
invention and it seems to have been

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:34,160
quite successful stories about it so we

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,330
are going to be use a bill connect for

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,570
the collaboration part and live sighs

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:46,810
stream it's not really important this is

00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:51,910
in electronics study so we we have made

00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:53,890
this box with all this stuff that that

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,460
the engineer will need so there will be

00:19:53,890 --> 00:20:03,430
a breadboard have pc oscilloscope and

00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:05,500
embed computer and all the tools of the

00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:09,760
need so that they can do exercises at

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,770
home we will they will get this the

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,530
first week and i will check that home so

00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:16,720
they could use it and by themselves the

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,160
unkempt campus to students of course

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:25,030
we'll be able to use laboratory

00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:28,300
facilities that we have on the campus so

00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:31,660
final topic and I think I'm almost out

00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:36,370
of time so how can we use Python in

00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:39,360
online education well of course you can

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:43,840
use pattern for teaching program that's

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,930
let's no not really any news but I think

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:52,030
it's actually a very good way of

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:54,520
teaching computer science also but since

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:58,960
this is a end education which focus on

00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:02,680
embedded systems we need to supplement

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,330
it with some see so that that taken that

00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:09,310
the students will have that on the cve

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:13,270
as well I want to use the ipython

00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:18,460
notebook as a matlab replacement and I

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:22,420
think that's perfectly reasonable but

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:29,220
well we'll see i'm not the only teacher

00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:31,780
on my education so okay so and when the

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,250
this is just an observation that when we

00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:38,410
have these internships we go and and and

00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:40,480
well we talk with the students while

00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,240
they are at the internship for to see if

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,700
they are all right and then we actually

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,060
more times and

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,070
x i'm not a discover that python

00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:53,400
actually is used in the industries for

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:57,510
different things so i don't think it's

00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:01,020
necessarily a downside to be able to

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:03,300
write in your on your CV that you have

00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,580
used python during your education i

00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:11,220
think that's that's perfectly valid to

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:14,730
have that so i'm at the end you can read

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:26,880
this i have spent all my time zone Thank

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:29,040
you Thank You Anders any questions hi

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,890
thanks for the talk you mentioned

00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,900
students potentially becoming disengaged

00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:37,320
and isolated if they're online only

00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:39,660
students how do you know if that's

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,660
happening do you do any analysis of

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:44,010
their usage and if you do see someone

00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:50,430
who's gone like that what you do about

00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:53,430
it so what I didn't discuss here was how

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:59,190
we are going to follow up throughout the

00:22:53,430 --> 00:23:02,370
semester but we will have one to 10 10

00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:04,590
skype sessions with the with the online

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:07,890
students we do that already with the

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:11,340
on-campus students we talked to them

00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:15,690
more times throughout the semester to

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:18,930
see how they are how they work if the

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,090
curriculum is suitable for them or if

00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:25,320
they are the teamwork is okay and

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:28,950
suppliers or we try to to interview our

00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:32,580
students in order to make sure that they

00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:36,420
are they're OK at it but that's

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:41,670
something that we value that should be

00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:43,560
very close closeness between the

00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,770
students and the faculty that we want to

00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:49,470
have that and we want to be approachable

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:53,049
as well so that's also why we have

00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:55,899
wanted a boot camp so to actually

00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:58,059
show ourselves as well we are teachers

00:23:55,899 --> 00:24:08,139
but we are also human beings that we are

00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:11,100
not dangerous anymore questions no thank

00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:11,100
