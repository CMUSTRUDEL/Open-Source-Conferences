	Roberto Polli - Scaling MySQL with Python
[EuroPython 2015]
[20 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

Python is the language of choice for the orchestration part of  MySQL 5.6. 

After a brief introduction of  MySQL replication architecture, the
talk [Slides here][1] presents the python utilities released by MySQL:

 - a set of drivers in pure-python 
 - mysql-utilites for replication, management and failover
 - fabric, a tool for scaling, sharding and provisioning new servers

You will see how to:

 -  create resilient configurations in minutes
 -  use mysql-fabric to create high available infrastructures

As a plus, we'll show how we:

 -  implemented a fabric provider for provisioning new databases via docker


# Prerequisites

Basic database knowledge,  transactions, replication. 

MySQL specific concepts (eg: binary logs) are briefly introduced in the talk.
