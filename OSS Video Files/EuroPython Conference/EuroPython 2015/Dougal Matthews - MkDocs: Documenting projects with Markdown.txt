MkDocs is a Python library for creating documentation with

for documentation writers and to help enable high quality prose
based documentation.

The primary maintainer of MkDocs will cover the following topics:

- An introduction to MkDocs and the project goals.
    - How and why did the project start?
    - Who uses MkDocs today?

- Discuss what we need to do to create great documentation and
  how MkDocs can help.

- A tour of the key features currently in MkDocs
    - Adding MkDocs to your project.
    - Using themes in the documentation and making customisations
    - Publishing your documentation with ReadTheDocs and GitHub
      pages.

- A look at the up and coming features in MkDocs and how you can
  help make these happen.

- A comparison with Sphinx and why you should consider MkDocs.
