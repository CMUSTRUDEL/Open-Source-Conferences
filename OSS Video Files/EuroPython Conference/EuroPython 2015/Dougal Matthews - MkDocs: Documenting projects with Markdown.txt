	Dougal Matthews - MkDocs: Documenting projects with Markdown
[EuroPython 2015]
[23 July 2015]
[Bilbao, Euskadi, Spain]

MkDocs is a Python library for creating documentation with
Markdown. The primary goal of the project is to lower the barrier
for documentation writers and to help enable high quality prose
based documentation.

The primary maintainer of MkDocs will cover the following topics:

- An introduction to MkDocs and the project goals.
    - How and why did the project start?
    - Who uses MkDocs today?

- Discuss what we need to do to create great documentation and
  how MkDocs can help.

- A tour of the key features currently in MkDocs
    - Adding MkDocs to your project.
    - Using themes in the documentation and making customisations
    - Publishing your documentation with ReadTheDocs and GitHub
      pages.

- A look at the up and coming features in MkDocs and how you can
  help make these happen.

- A comparison with Sphinx and why you should consider MkDocs.

hi and thanks for coming along

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:09,900
yes in my name is Dougal Matthews and I

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,380
work for Red Hat and primarily I'm

00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:15,990
working on OpenStack for work and is

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,789
just a side project of mine I also live

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,250
in Glasgow where I run this of the local

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,070
Python group that's probably about all

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,480
you need to know about me yeah and I

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,359
hope everyone's feeling okay after the

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,429
party last night and today I'm going to

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:30,869
be speaking about MK donks and so the

00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,099
first thing to get off the way is how do

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:34,469
you actually pronounce the name of this

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,320
and it's an you can either call the big

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:40,410
docks and key docks or make docks I tend

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,950
to go with MK docks we should probably

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,780
decide at some point so the you probably

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,610
can't really read that it's like a

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,770
really low quality but the the point of

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:53,129
it was the the project started on the

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,600
10th of January in 2014 and that was

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,760
when Ellis blew out his own code base so

00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,559
originally it was part of the Django

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,890
rest framework code base it was a just a

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,390
single file inkay adopts top py and that

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,860
actually went back to around September

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,150
2012 and so the project was started by a

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,450
guy called Tom Christie who most people

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,820
know for his work on generous room watch

00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:16,830
and then last year when Tom was speaking

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,299
about it at Europe - I was in the

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,470
audience and that's when I started to

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,000
get interested and involved in the

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,290
project I was sitting in the audience

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,659
and I was kind of missing around in my

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,220
laptop a bit as you do and I looked at

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,100
the github and I noticed that the Travis

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,229
build was failing and that kind of got

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,640
myself OCD senses and I had to tell the

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,860
need to try and fix the the failing

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,560
tests and that kind of yeah I just got

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,909
stuck into the project since then I did

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,049
consider breaking the build today to see

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,130
if I could get more contributors but

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,020
couldn't quite bring myself to do it and

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,659
so thinking about the the project and

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,890
the goals they they're quite simple

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,420
really what we're trying to do I think

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,159
and the reason for that is I really

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,360
wonder the project to be something is

00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,670
easy for everyone to use and really

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:58,380
simple to use

00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,899
so it's really about making writing good

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,670
documentation easier and focusing on

00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,890
high quality prose based documentation

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:06,119
so I'm not really interested in being

00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,500
able to automatically generate the

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:12,000
documentation based on code comments and

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,440
one of the things that people mistake

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,790
about me when they hear I work

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,710
this project they assumed I'm probably

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:18,600
good at writing documentation but

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,100
actually I'm probably just as bad a

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,860
documentation right to raise your

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,330
average person so this is really it's

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,860
almost like the ultimate procrastination

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,670
of avoiding mind documentation I'm

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,740
writing a tool for writing documentation

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:33,480
but I want to make it as easy as I can

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,720
for myself and everyone else and I'm

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,040
trying to improve as well as I go so to

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,750
sort of explain what I mean by high

00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,210
quality prose documentation I'm thinking

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,950
of projects like Django or I think maybe

00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,410
jQuery or bootstraps I think of non

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,030
Python ones where they they treat their

00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,560
documentation in the same way they treat

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:52,020
their code they're really focusing on

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,580
selves crafting and looking after it

00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,710
it's not something that's just generated

00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,620
or enough to thought it's of on par with

00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,180
code I think and some of these projects

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,680
probably have a API generated

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,900
documentation as well but that's very

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,250
much kind of a side of the documentation

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,360
so you have your main part and then

00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:08,040
there's like you can go to the API

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,150
reference if you want afterwards which

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,150
can definitely be useful in some cases

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:18,300
and we've grown quite a lot in the last

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,730
year it's actually really a reasonably

00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,850
popular project now I just sort of

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,440
talked four of the larger projects based

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,900
on popularity so this is based on things

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,640
like how big the documentation is and

00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,459
how popular they're on github and stuff

00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,200
like that the first one you'll is

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:43,709
obvious because Tom wrote this project

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:44,870
originally gloucester FS is also okay

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:47,100
sorry

00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,930
Gloucester offenses are distributed

00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,300
networking file system and that's um

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:53,400
they just have a really large set of

00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,500
documentation like I think in the

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,940
hundreds of markdown files so it's just

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,739
quite nice to see their work so well for

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,950
such a large project then the doctor

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,959
Python client and finally Facebook's OS

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,880
query which is something to do with it's

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,930
like a query language for finding stuff

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,690
about your operating system which is

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,480
actually interesting we we get a lot of

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,769
users coming from read the docs so many

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,450
of you will know read the docs too old

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,220
but a lot of people don't know as they

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,480
support a lot of people know they

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:23,370
support Sphinx project and they also

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,510
support MPI docs projects so you find a

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,800
lot of people warranty use read the docs

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,919
from different communities because out

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,889
of these I think only

00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,389
sorry - Xander Python and so on and we

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:32,650
got a lot of people want to usually dr.

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:33,729
bit don't want to learn Python till and

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:39,490
they don't want to learn restructured

00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:42,879
text and I kind of overlapped with this

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,590
light slightly it's what I'm really

00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,779
interested is in making good

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,610
documentation tools for everyone it

00:04:46,779 --> 00:04:50,229
could be for developers or just general

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:53,319
technical writers it's not necessarily

00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:54,759
about just the Python crowd I want it to

00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,469
be something there's really open to

00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:57,779
everyone and it's just really keeping

00:04:56,469 --> 00:05:00,460
things simple and easy to use

00:04:57,779 --> 00:05:03,129
so for example that you have a git

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,330
repository of markdown files and nothing

00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:06,039
else in there at all you can actually

00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,479
tell read the docs to build that they

00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:12,159
will generate a sort of a stub config

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,389
file when they go and they say and I'll

00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,460
do a couple of settings that they

00:05:13,389 --> 00:05:16,900
require for their building but otherwise

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:22,990
it will just work and all these rendered

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:24,629
fine yeah and it's just you can make it

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,889
much easier than that

00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:28,599
so when you actually generate your

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,659
documentation this is what it might look

00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,659
like

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:44,770
sorry about the screenshot right so this

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,509
is the default theme for entry dots and

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,490
this is just it's a bootstrap based

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,139
theme they shows a few a couple of

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,779
interesting things which you won't be

00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:54,939
able to read but I can point them out so

00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:57,460
obviously this is your main text body in

00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:58,779
the middle here and then over on the

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,629
left you've got the table of contents

00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,339
along the top which obviously reflects

00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:04,719
the chrome page the navigation on the

00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:06,879
top is based on the files that you've

00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:09,069
got in your documentation and then we've

00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:11,110
got a search up here which uses lunar

00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,419
ojs which is a front-end search engine

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,159
javascript run and then just back and

00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,689
forward pages so we've got quite a lot

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:22,120
of features which would just get for

00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:23,710
free essentially when using MK dots and

00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,080
then you can see the same thing again

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,270
this is our read the docs theme so have

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,860
you've seen any large projects on read

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,149
the docs you might sorry you might seen

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,250
some and not realize because it looks

00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:34,300
very like this things to theme there are

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,979
a couple of tells of you know them well

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:40,610
but they yeah it's quite subtle the

00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:46,009
biggest one is at the very bottom

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:48,199
there's bill with them mm and yeah this

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,699
is probably our most sorry most popular

00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,650
theme the one thing to know is if you

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:52,909
are building on read the docs they don't

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,800
currently don't let you use any other

00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:56,060
themes than this one at the moment just

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,159
because there's some integration

00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,870
contract we need to sort of establish

00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:04,460
and it's a bit tricky for custom themes

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,080
to do that but we're working on it so if

00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:08,629
you want to get started with it the

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,020
plumpy records are that you need pip and

00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:13,129
Python installed obviously at some point

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,569
I would like to change that because I

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,770
say I want to reach beyond the Python

00:07:14,569 --> 00:07:17,960
community so it'd be nice to have

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,449
installs for Windows and Mac I'm aware

00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,159
of people doing packaging for fedora and

00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:23,300
Debbie and the fedora one looks like

00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,830
it's coming along well I think the

00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:30,169
Debian ones already out of date as

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,400
happens with packaging beer at some

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:33,379
point it would be nice to do some

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,389
official distributions in that way too

00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:36,440
to reach more people because we we do

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,419
have a lot of people that are struggling

00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,949
on Windows and so on and it's also quite

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:43,069
painful me too for me to support them in

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:46,909
certain manually right and now I'm just

00:07:43,069 --> 00:07:53,349
gonna try and torn the demo gods and do

00:07:46,909 --> 00:07:53,349
a demo there we go

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,270
okay so what I've got here is I've got

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,770
an end to git repository the reason for

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,790
being a git repository should have been

00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:07,440
empty the reason for being empty sorry

00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:10,580
what being a repository will be apparent

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:17,850
in a minute I'm just gonna make a

00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:31,980
virtual and this is where the internet

00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:35,790
needs to hold up very briefly okay okay

00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:37,410
thanks Kashi's right and in this slide

00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:41,000
you that you see and I'd done MP adopts

00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,000
new so I'm just gonna turn this into a

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,780
MP a lot to new and I don't actually

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,800
need to do the directory name because I

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,230
want to do it here so I'm just going to

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:53,730
do dot and that's added a basic wanted

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,040
file and just it's pretty the docs

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,050
directory with one index in it and now

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,050
these are very simple files

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,670
okay it's just gonna float and

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,860
unfortunately I can't see this very

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,510
easily so that's the it just defines the

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,970
name which is huge

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:31,079
and then there's a one markdown file

00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:35,790
there which is also but hopefully she

00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:38,010
don't be able to read those okay

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,390
and now at this point as I had in the

00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:45,350
slide you can just do include art serve

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:45,350
and this will just work now locally

00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,519
there we go

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,790
hmm sorry I had these windows all laid

00:10:10,749 --> 00:10:16,769
out before anything moved which is in

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:16,769
purity right

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,390
I do you know how to use them as most of

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,530
the time right well anyway you can

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:34,530
roughly see what I'm doing the point I

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,330
want to make here is the the MP doc

00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:38,010
swatches of files and at live reloads we

00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,330
also use WebSockets so it'll refresh the

00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,690
browser automatically as you go

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:44,340
so when nice I just do testing title and

00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,080
you should see that the commands on the

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:48,390
Left will just go and it's a really nice

00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,770
experience when you're editing it's very

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,880
tricky apparently like this but when

00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,320
you've got a reasonably sized monitor

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,700
having a side-by-side and you're working

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,700
it's a release of a selective process

00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:07,520
okay it's also worth noting I don't know

00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,900
okay and then when you are adding new

00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,670
files they will just be automatically

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,790
picked up by the same automatically

00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,380
reloading and added to the navigation

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:21,120
but because that's too small that's

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,800
common to the bar mode which is a little

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,880
silly but there you go it's already been

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,590
added there and that'll keep happening

00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,300
if you've got - it directories or create

00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,300
a drop-down menu in the sub and so on

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,510
and then you can see I'm sort of such

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,680
working here so which is quite nice that

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,340
works really well it's really fast

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,110
because it's all done locally and then

00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,140
the one final thing I want to do because

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:55,790
it's quite nice to see that I can get

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:57,560
back to this is the experience of

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:04,760
changing the theme because that works

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:06,860
really well with the no live reload so

00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,360
this is my company I'm just changing it

00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,710
to use every deluxe theme and every load

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,210
and it just changes and that keeps where

00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:13,280
you are on the page and it's just quite

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:14,420
there's just quite nice since it feels

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,190
really satisfying when you're trying out

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,250
different themes so we need more themes

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:22,910
just so I can do that more and then

00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:24,350
finally to just so finish off the the

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,210
full example workflow of how easy these

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,340
things can be and this is why I cloned

00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:31,070
to give a sorry a git repository which

00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:35,830
is am on github there was empty so I can

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:38,030
just do in clear Docs github deploy and

00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:42,490
takes a little moment and now this

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,490
documentation should be live on here

00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,300
okay you can just trust me that it's

00:12:56,630 --> 00:13:02,710
like I can show any skeptics at the end

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,710
and we'll go back to the presentation

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:14,649
okay so that's just kind of showing you

00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:17,320
the sort of the full workflow of how you

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,790
use it within a very simple setup and

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,730
it's just this really nice and very easy

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,630
this very little what you have to do but

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,040
then when you're going a bit further

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:25,930
with documentation then you can start to

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,170
think about how these files would all

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,220
work together one of the one of the

00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,560
things that's quite common is linking

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,370
between different sections and I just

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
got slide for this because this

00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:36,339
definitely confuses some users because

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,250
basically what you should do is you link

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:41,350
to a markdown file directly then during

00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,029
the build process we updated that

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,220
reference so it goes to the HTML path

00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:48,399
file instead and the nice thing about

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,649
that is when you browse the markdown on

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,820
github for example the links will still

00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:55,540
live because it goes between the

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,380
different markdown files and then when

00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,880
you're looking between different

00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,529
sections you can use anchors bit which

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,570
are in all the header tags and that

00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:03,310
works really well but it's also it's not

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,540
ideal just when you want to ever change

00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,130
the title or anything you can break a

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,630
link so we're working on improving that

00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:13,810
the detection and warning about if that

00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:15,730
happens you seen the configuration file

00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:18,730
very briefly when I was attempting to

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,839
demo and I didn't really go into much

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,089
detail that because I thought I'd used

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,540
to focus on it now but it's basically a

00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:27,040
yellow file and again that's about users

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,450
shouldn't have to edit a Python file to

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,320
do configuration for their documentation

00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:33,700
at least ideally and the only actual

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,020
content option that is required is the

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,670
site name which is the one you've seen

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,100
everything else we sort of rely on

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,320
sensible defaults but you can change the

00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,700
majority of things like where it loads

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,980
the documentation from where it builds

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,209
to what's the image using what pages are

00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:47,980
included what pictures aren't included

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:49,180
that we by default there seems

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,470
reasonably sensible that you would want

00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,860
to include all of your markdown files

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,360
for example so we just add them all and

00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:58,829
we add them all to the navigation and we

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,829
index more than 13 and so on

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,400
and I then also showed you the the

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,230
deploying and that was just one of the

00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,060
ways you can deploy very easily with MP

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,070
Docs because the output is just a static

00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:13,560
website the github pages watch really

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,940
well the reintegration is great and they

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,140
add some extra things on top like they

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,110
do with swings to do with different

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,580
versions so you can have different

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,900
versions with different builds showing

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,510
like different branches or tags in the

00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,300
u.k repository and then the Python

00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,170
hosted is also really good that's the

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,520
hosting with teaser shop I won't

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,570
actually go into any example of that but

00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:36,090
we have a good example in our

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:37,620
documentation in the this is something

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,850
that's actually new and get master we've

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,100
not quite released it yet but it'll

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:42,660
happen soon I'm so it's to do with you

00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,160
can now package up the themes and upload

00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:45,960
them to pi PI so it's time to get much

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,760
more distribution there and I'm hoping

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,560
that ones that we're also moving a bunch

00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,820
of our own themes out externally so they

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,020
can be installed rather than just all

00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,640
included because at the moment I think

00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:55,140
we've got seventeen because they've got

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,580
a bunch of boots watch ones which are

00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:58,470
like slightly thin different bootstrap

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,650
themes but they're maintenance of that

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:04,320
as a bit of pain so yeah I'm hoping when

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,460
this happens will then be able to see

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,200
like an increase in the number of themes

00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,310
available and we'll be able to reuse

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,930
some of the other ones that people are

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,160
currently distributing what sorry

00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:12,450
including in their source because that's

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,280
the only way you can really do a custom

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,160
theme which is by using the theme

00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,860
directory and providing a local path

00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,560
which isn't ideal

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,510
and so I've beyond that where I'm kind

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,270
of doing I've been on a push for a 1.0

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:28,410
but it's a it's kind of fair to say that

00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,890
I've been doing that for around about

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:33,480
six months or so I initially started and

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,130
I was like I really wanted to push for

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,900
it to be as quick as possible by a step

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:38,550
back a bit and I'm I'm just trying to

00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,840
self definitely add features and then

00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,070
I'll get there when we get there at the

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,120
end of the day I could call the torrent

00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,250
version at one point no it doesn't make

00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,020
it huge ton of difference but yeah the

00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,790
goal is to not add too many more

00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,050
features at the moment we really feel

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,370
like were feature complete it's more

00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,080
about polishing things making things

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:54,570
work really well there are a couple of

00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,310
additions I'm considering trying to get

00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,660
in for one point on which is a much

00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:00,540
better support for information

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,190
internationalization at the moment

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,630
people can use Unicode and writing where

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,589
the language they want it gets tricky

00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,100
when you want to support multiple

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,990
languages and also building multiple

00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,310
versions is something you can do

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,630
manually about my teachers helpful

00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,569
automate that process for people with

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,459
some same defaults

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,870
it's a fairly common pattern there's

00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:19,630
something that we struggle with on Emily

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,039
doctor or itself that whenever I do we

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,539
do have release and then I built a new

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,549
feature I can't update the documentation

00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:30,759
with anything else until the new new

00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:34,029
version is released okay

00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:35,200
and that actually sort of brings me I

00:17:34,029 --> 00:17:37,149
think I think I powered through that

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,130
really quickly that kind of brings me to

00:17:37,149 --> 00:17:41,380
the the end where I would have you take

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:42,669
care of questions about the project or

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,059
Ozona thing else you'd like to know

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:44,500
about it

00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,659
and there's some of my contact details

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,580
if you want to know want to find out

00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,649
more or speak to me later and I'm also

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:53,230
hoping to spring on Saturday as well if

00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:55,350
anyone wants to to join my life so thank

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,350
you

00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:19,300
thank you I have a lot of question and

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:22,700
maybe additional information information

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,920
do you have any problems that's M

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,550
conducts blast sir if the dogs broke

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:31,970
through the links you know joy if any

00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:35,900
problem sorry sorry in my experience

00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:43,400
it's the dogs last MK dogs yeah break

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:45,080
the links in okay do you know that I've

00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,270
noticed no and I've not seen I'm not

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,920
wearing any open body about it but I'd

00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:57,710
be happy to take a look after and help

00:18:48,920 --> 00:19:02,260
you okay and use this model that

00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:05,720
supports only first version of markdown

00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:07,220
now expensive fix sections you know we

00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,770
you can use extensions they can be

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:15,460
defined in the MK dogs config okay

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:15,460
thanks and can you can you say some

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:28,150
strings docstrings MacDonald come in

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:32,060
because I use right now the dog and it's

00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:34,580
so in terms of pulling in dog strings

00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:35,870
into your documentation yeah yeah so we

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,390
don't really have any good support at

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,030
the moment it's something I don't think

00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:44,210
we really want to have that in MK dots

00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:45,320
itself what we'd really like to do is do

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:47,060
something like that more with a plug-in

00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,710
API because it's definitely something

00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:51,590
that people want but there's so many

00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,940
different variations and yeah if we

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,440
included something by default it would

00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:57,110
probably be a Python one that we want to

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,850
try and to stay a bit more general so

00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,280
yeah not really going at the moment I'm

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,750
aware of some people they've got some

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,520
tools to get the dog strings out which

00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,470
then outfits markdown and then they just

00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:08,120
build the markdown and it actually looks

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:13,340
pretty good I've had any need for it

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:17,440
myself okay thanks and in conduct

00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:20,510
supports only two level of links anymore

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,950
now that I that was fixed around a

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,830
couple of months ago it's definitely the

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:28,340
last two releases yeah

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:30,760
yeah that was a night you hear more

00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,760
questions

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,649
so what would be a major reason for

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:54,029
using this over and above sinks okay um

00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:56,549
for a lot of people they simply mount

00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:58,320
down or it's I think I might be

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:01,230
mentioned it just before your command

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,549
well it's fine and so a lot of people

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,809
wanted to use with the docks for example

00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:05,309
but they are not from a Python

00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,749
background so they don't want to learn

00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:08,460
Python tooling and they don't want to

00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:10,259
learn to restructure text because

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,859
typically you only know those of you

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:15,840
have one developer but yeah I mean I for

00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:18,179
me it's just the real simplicity it's

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,989
something that's just yeah that's what

00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:20,989
really attracts me to

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:30,690
probably mention that but I was a bit

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:34,980
late here so that's that is to support

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:38,040
like codes highlighting or like if I

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,700
want to write some sorry I didn't quite

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,860
clever

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,070
Jeannine markdown you can write code

00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:46,680
right yeah but can't use somehow signal

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,040
the type of the language yes

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,810
this isn't included this is um it's

00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,620
called fenced closed blots so you do

00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,600
like three backticks then you put the

00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,680
name of the language and then you write

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,930
your code block and then three more

00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:04,170
tactics and that you can say which

00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:05,640
language it is then we we definitely

00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,470
need to improve our highlighting there

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,180
at the moment it's kind of deferred to

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:11,220
the theme so that means people are using

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,160
using javascript libraries to do it and

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:16,460
they're not not as good as some of the

00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,460
other tools

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,570
