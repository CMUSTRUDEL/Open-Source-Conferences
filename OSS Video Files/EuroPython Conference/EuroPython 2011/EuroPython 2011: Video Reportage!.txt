it's a great square to be at an event

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:02,729
with people from all over the place you

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,970
get to socialize exchange ideas of

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:10,050
fertilized each other brains with new

00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:12,840
ideas from with people from all over the

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,180
world that just can't be beaten another

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,980
thing that cannot possibly be improved

00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:30,959
is as you draw the quality of the food

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:35,090
which are rightly famous for I think

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,590
there is a very much a strong sense of

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,239
especially knowledge sharing and I think

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,220
you need that sense of knowledge sharing

00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:46,980
to develop good code to develop a good

00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,250
language and it's fantastic to see so

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,500
many people being open and willing to

00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,950
share it's it's really really fantastic

00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,950
to see

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:25,959
I think we're on the right track if you

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:29,410
look at the pike on US Conference it's

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,720
been growing exponentially and I am

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:34,599
seeing sort of the same kind of movement

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,670
for the european conference of course if

00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,650
we always do it in nice places like

00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,510
these then of course the number for 10

00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,950
years is going to grow as well so so

00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,799
next year I think it's going to be even

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:49,989
more people coming here and if you

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:52,660
perhaps can get a Guido or other poor

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,130
people to invite them to attend the

00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:56,370
conference as well it's going to be even

00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,370
