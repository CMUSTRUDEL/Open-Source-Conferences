this sucks carry you you can still

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,209
around for your life from the dog okay

00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:13,429
if you cannot leave for an hour without

00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:17,090
seeing the source code we will be

00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:19,789
talking about Python of course so first

00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:22,880
of all a very few words about the place

00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:25,099
I work in it's called crs-4 it's a

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,359
Research Center which was establish in

00:00:25,099 --> 00:00:32,419
the first 1990s by the Nobel Prize for

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,640
an idea of the Nobel Prize Columbia and

00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:38,710
we do fundamentally three kind of things

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:41,300
we do research in ICT we do research in

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,790
environmental sciences and renewable

00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:46,820
energies and in biomedicine in clinical

00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,610
and clinical research so what we'll be

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:52,970
talking about first of all what exact

00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:56,360
field do we work in and then what's the

00:00:52,970 --> 00:01:00,310
project and why did we choose to use

00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:03,860
Python and did it work well and then

00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,900
with claims into the future where do we

00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:08,720
go from here

00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:11,900
so what field do we work in well usually

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,180
when you hear about biomedical research

00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:17,720
and clinical research you'll think about

00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:21,680
lab coats microscope maybe various

00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,800
specialists but this is not the kind of

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,730
thing my group does we do have for

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:31,190
example excellent genotyping facility

00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,290
success for so we do that kind of not

00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:35,240
brain specialists but we do that kind of

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:38,210
lab coats microscope things as well but

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,560
my groups which is called healthcare

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,600
flows they'll switch the ICT in medicine

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,180
so what kind of things do we do well

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,220
first of all distributed medicine for

00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:53,110
instance tell a consulting we we have a

00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:56,479
system we are developing right now that

00:01:53,110 --> 00:02:00,470
allows cardiologists a pediatric

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,770
cardiologist to visit its patients from

00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,659
a distance which is cool and semantic

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:08,119
and computational management what does

00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:10,639
it mean well we have a lot of data

00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,569
nowadays of digital data and healthcare

00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,810
is no exception

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:16,330
it's the so called data deluge

00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:19,569
lots of data terabytes of data coming

00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:22,030
from from Jim typing from a clinical

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:23,739
data but the mother is how can we use

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,770
data coming from different sources

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:29,140
together you have to have a conceptual

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,690
model a technological model to relate

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:35,500
data coming from everywhere so that's

00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:38,530
another thing we do but the project I

00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,150
will be talking about is in the field of

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:41,890
clinical system integration and

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:44,470
traceability what doesn't mean

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,750
traceability it means you are able to

00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,600
follow the path of your data of your

00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:52,120
processes what are we doing what did

00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,630
happen during my clinical process and

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:59,470
why is that important why do we bother

00:02:54,630 --> 00:03:04,330
well there was a report by the Institute

00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:07,599
of Medicine in year 2000 then that quite

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,420
spurred the industry into caring about

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,920
sociability because it presented quite

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:17,100
ghastly figures like this one each year

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,609
in the United States alone

00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:23,730
44 to 98 thousand people die due to

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:29,069
prevent them preventable medical errors

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:33,600
think about wrong dose of chemicals or

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:38,290
wrong dose of radiation or just swapping

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:42,400
transfusion blood bags it's it's a huge

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:44,579
number and it's scary by itself but to

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,090
better put things in perspective I

00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:54,549
present here it besides other common

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:57,220
that causes in the United States so as

00:03:54,549 --> 00:04:00,069
you can see it's actually easier more

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,639
probable to die for medical errors than

00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:06,190
for breast cancer and ten times easier

00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:08,769
to die from a medical error than from a

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:12,250
motorcycle accident so it's unacceptable

00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:16,030
and so how do we solve the problem we

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:19,660
are developers we are ICT workers so

00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:22,780
alpha my first my first thought was well

00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:24,820
we could use computers that's why we are

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,800
developers because we believe in the

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,130
possibility of solving problems which

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,100
come

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,880
the age of computers and there are

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,070
studies recent studies that show a

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,930
positive correlation between the use of

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:43,780
ICT and safety and efficiency of care

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:46,930
this is one study carried out during in

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:51,460
two years in Texas forty-one hospitals

00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:55,300
about 170,000 patients so it's a big

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,840
study it has found some correlations so

00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,940
how how much ICT are we doing at the

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,790
moment in the healthcare sector well I

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,520
have this figure for Erie which is 1

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,010
billion euros sounds like a very big

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,110
sound but it's not why because if you

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:15,910
think about the mention of the whole

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:21,760
healthcare sector it's about 7 percent

00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:25,000
of Italian GDP which means more than 240

00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:28,350
videos euros which is I think nowadays a

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,350
gazillion dollars or something

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,730
this make is a very small sum and if you

00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,280
look at the figures you'll see that

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:39,460
actually healthcare is the sector where

00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,410
I exit E is more underutilized as not

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,880
only in Italy it's the same at European

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:46,120
level it's the same in the United States

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,030
as well so it's the harder sector and we

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,110
don't do enough in ICT but that's more

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:57,520
how do physicians actually use computers

00:05:53,110 --> 00:06:02,050
what for and as you can see they used

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,230
them a lot for billing doing voices for

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,270
scheduling their appointments only the

00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,100
third only that the certain circled one

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:10,270
this has to do with clinical data so

00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,270
that's cool of course

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:15,780
ICT is useful for billing but they that

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:19,030
wants actually have to lower that number

00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:21,430
so not only we have to do more ICT we

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:24,730
have to do ICT for the right things and

00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:26,500
there's more this must be the scarier

00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:29,140
website I've ever seen in my

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,170
professional life except maybe windows

00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:35,680
API but that's another story and this is

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:39,250
a complete database of documented cases

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,870
in which information technology errors

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,210
had adverse

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,330
facts so called adverse effects up to

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,160
death on patients think about a computer

00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:50,920
system that regulates the amount of

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,180
radiation in cancer therapy too much

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:58,270
variation into the patient the opposite

00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:01,140
you don't you don't you are not curing

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:04,690
him so you kill the patient as well so

00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,450
so how how to do there ice it in the

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,120
right way without it causing even more

00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:13,630
problems where you all developer of an

00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,570
open source language so I'm sure I don't

00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:19,230
have to persuade you that standards are

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:24,100
a good thing let's think about Ethernet

00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:27,970
if we didn't have to CP IP what we would

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,880
have today is would be a number of very

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,530
small networks not interconnected

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,350
CompuServe and Apple net Python that

00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,550
maybe who knows and that's what you find

00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:43,510
usually in hospitals lots of small

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:46,810
digital islands this one touch may be

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:49,270
the language of one one company and so

00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:51,610
on and so forth but we do have we do

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:56,830
have work undergoing we have for

00:07:51,610 --> 00:08:00,730
instance HT level 7 half lever 7 and the

00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:03,070
level 7 refers to the either OSI stack

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,870
so it's for application for clinical

00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,820
applications it's a global Authority

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,610
which members everyone the world and

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:12,070
they do standards for interoperability

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:14,440
documents and the main standards are

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,970
called like like the organization which

00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,420
is convenient because one less thing to

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,520
remember and version 2 is a pipe in text

00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:25,420
format separated by pipes version 3 is

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,080
more xima like and so that's nice but

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,930
it's not enough because ok we we can

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,150
have systems then can talk between

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,130
themselves and this is very important

00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:39,280
because you don't have to go in front of

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,520
the monitor and write out staff in paper

00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,950
and do data entry gain which happens

00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,140
which actually happens but it's not

00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,660
enough because one of the most difficult

00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,900
things in the field of healthcare

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,840
nowadays is the hospital are hugely

00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,960
complex of

00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:59,450
you have dozens of professional from

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,290
different backgrounds not all our

00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,850
physicians there are nurses there are

00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,010
all colleagues of course system

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,560
administrator and patients as well which

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,020
really are positions so a lot of a lot

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,410
of persons trying to do work for the

00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,540
same way and for the same reason and of

00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,400
course we have dozens of different

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:22,730
processes we have patient admission we

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:26,029
have surgery we have PR we have exams

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,700
and a lot of stuff to do and you have to

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:31,279
do that too in a standard way

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,830
because it's very important the order in

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,779
which you do things that the datapath

00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,230
between systems when you do an exam and

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:41,300
so on and so forth so there's another

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:43,850
organization ihe integrating the

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:52,089
healthcare environment that does just

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:55,580
that you can see it has about 450 500

00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,770
members we are very in there or in

00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,070
Dussel parties in there and so on what

00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:04,910
they do is publish manuals documents

00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,520
they call transactions and profiles from

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,760
a developer's point of view they're just

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:13,940
huge collection of use cases the very

00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,930
UML meaning of the world they have

00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:21,980
actors the sequence diagrams so if you

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:25,310
have to implement something laboratory

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,010
medicine you find the exact procedures

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,770
in the manual how you are supposed to do

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:34,100
it what message should be passed around

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:37,330
which is very important so what's the

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:43,040
project of course we want to bring

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:44,900
wanted to bring Richie standards and hl7

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,980
into the real world into the clinical

00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:51,580
world where to start as I've said you

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,010
before there are dozens of different

00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,600
things that happen in a hospital where

00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,450
to start you have to start somewhere

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,529
physically and so we we started from

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,529
from this

00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:10,000
six seven times out of ten what happens

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:12,250
medicine especially critical

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,910
decision-making which means do we do

00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:16,480
surgery do we sever his limbs and so on

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,810
so forth

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:24,640
of course it's leveraged by laboratory

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:27,190
exams I think it has happened to every

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,460
one of us you go to the physician she is

00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:33,010
not very sure so let's do maybe this and

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,930
these and these blood tests and of

00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:37,120
course if the death is wrong the

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:41,310
decision will be probably wrong as well

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:45,600
so that's where we decided to start and

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:49,950
we have some data about what where the

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:53,200
mistakes happen in - in this process and

00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,779
you see this is the core business this

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,839
is the blood or specimen being taken and

00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:02,740
analyzed surprising that only one arrow

00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:04,420
out of ten is here why well because a

00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:08,260
laboratory is quite an homogeneous

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,880
environment it's full of the same type

00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,040
of professional lab technicians that are

00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,530
trained to do that kind of work most

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:17,950
exams are performed by machines by

00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:20,620
robots and so over the years you just

00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:23,470
use it using common quality control

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:27,250
techniques it says it has become a very

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:32,620
safe environment but three arrows out of

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:34,930
town happened even before it an six

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,480
arrow sorry out of ten a purse even

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:41,380
before getting to the laboratory how is

00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:44,710
that possible I mean we don't have the

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:49,230
test how can you be wrong is there a

00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:51,330
time machine no this is from it

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,700
developer point of view what happens

00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:56,920
some physician face okay you have to do

00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,730
a goose and if index maybe or some other

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,580
kind of test and then we have the

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:06,550
results of course what what's

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,920
problematic is the the path is in the

00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,200
middle is called phlebotomy which means

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,530
taking specimen from your body in vivo

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,949
which could be usual blood but not only

00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:17,619
blood

00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:22,119
so what can go wrong looks quite simple

00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:25,079
it's not first of all if there are

00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:28,089
systems that are now not interconnected

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:32,589
there are a lot of typing errors so

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:37,499
maybe you are named one way but the last

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:41,049
type it's wrong and their patient

00:13:37,499 --> 00:13:43,779
misidentification or maybe just it's

00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:47,230
it's the general practitioner or the

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:52,299
physician that just orders the wrong

00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:56,230
kind of tests what can happen is wrong

00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:58,480
wrong to type because not all tips from

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,519
that are the same they have different

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,639
kind of chemicals depending on what's

00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,040
what specific tests you are going to do

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,079
which are identified back up call or try

00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:12,879
to notice that well next time you have

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,850
and can be clothing activator or heparin

00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:18,279
lots of stuff and if you'd take the

00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,879
blood into the one to type for the wrong

00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:24,819
action well at least you have to do that

00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:29,199
exam again which could be dangerous if

00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:29,980
it was an emergency or if you're not

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,980
that lucky

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:38,949
the error goes undetected and the test

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:42,309
of course we give up on the data so just

00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:46,199
some blood tubes and another another

00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:50,290
point of failure is labels how can such

00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:55,360
trivial things like a label can be a fun

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:58,689
to fail well the label is the Union the

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,600
path to tie together the physical world

00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:06,279
where the specimen sites and the data

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:09,879
world so if if what happens for instant

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:12,999
is that it's written manually and you

00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:16,539
miss read it and most bloody stuff again

00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:17,980
maybe you swap patients so I'm positive

00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:20,669
and I become negative and the other way

00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,019
around so the level is very important so

00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:25,569
also errors I won't go into detail but

00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:28,110
they are just arrived from ihe profiles

00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:32,519
and so what sure what

00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:37,500
our solution here is the overview of our

00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:41,579
system you can see on the green one the

00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,290
green guys are hardware or that's a

00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:46,079
partner called impecca it's a group

00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:48,540
which was leader in laboratory

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:52,019
automation so they really know their way

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:55,560
in medical robots and so on as for has

00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:59,399
made to Levellers which are just robots

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:02,160
that can process tubes they can apply

00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,769
lava in a very good way they could print

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,200
them clearly they have sensor for

00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:09,269
instance to read cap collars wait a

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,180
minute this is pink it is supposed to be

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:15,630
red you're wrong and that kind of stuff

00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:19,350
of course this is very good but if this

00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:22,230
is the heart of the system it can't

00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:26,730
really know what you are going what you

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:29,880
are supposed to do because of course

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:34,410
it's red but how can can the system know

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,209
it should be pink well that's the job of

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,680
these other party integration engine

00:16:36,209 --> 00:16:40,320
which is the mind of a system is

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,079
implemented using a open source software

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,730
called mirth which does two important

00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:46,890
things first of all it translate between

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,019
the laboratory information system which

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:52,350
could be vintage we could be have some

00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:55,110
old protocol no matter what it will be

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,540
able to get the data out of it may be

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:00,920
polling on a database table whatever and

00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:04,230
it will export complete and ER compliant

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,870
hl7 inside so it's a translator first of

00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:09,870
all but then again it implements ihe

00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:12,929
actors it decides what message gets

00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:17,400
pestered when I an exam is inserted into

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:19,919
the way so so it's a real it's the real

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,980
mind of the system and then we have apps

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:25,650
applications that are used by the nurses

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,220
and by the lab technicians and so on and

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:30,480
so forth

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:33,780
so at this point why Python well we had

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,179
we had Y and tau first of all why we had

00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:40,050
some requirements of course for this

00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,140
project and I want to show you first of

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:44,260
all we were too

00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,450
be very readable why well because first

00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,090
of all not all of professional involved

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:51,820
in this project were and are developers

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,000
for instance mechanical engineers do the

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:58,390
harder part and they're not programmers

00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:02,410
so if you have readable code you can use

00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:05,530
it to pass along ideas in a very precise

00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,450
way you can do that if it's full of

00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,520
technical it tastes like public private

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:14,500
implements throws and so on the support

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:16,630
and besides this is an environment field

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,790
where coded it should be very frequent

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,860
sometimes they are required sometimes

00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:24,880
you just want to do them because it's

00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:27,970
better to do them and as the shorter and

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,160
the moldable the code is the easier is

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,220
to perform them second requirement

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,710
agility why because in this field we

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:38,500
have lots of standards to laws and

00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:41,020
regulations and if you do have a client

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,690
from a new nation you have to to think

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,300
things again because you should you

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,940
could have some something new and every

00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,810
hospital institution has their

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,660
requirements and besides we are a

00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:58,600
research center working with an industry

00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,710
so if who comments change it's positive

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:05,350
because it means we are exchanging or

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,780
knowledge they change their view of of

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:10,420
the problem and we do as well so we must

00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:14,740
be ready to to change when it's needed

00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:16,140
third portability because in the real

00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:19,390
world there's a lot of stuff

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,310
completeness we have we had a lot of

00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:23,820
different isolates for a project of this

00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:27,570
scope and we needed something that could

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:32,500
have a lot of libraries a lot of

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:35,470
features and last ease of deployment we

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,510
don't want to have to keep track of 100

00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:41,350
external packages to keep track of

00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:43,600
packages being discontinued or not not

00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:45,820
backwards compatible anymore so as few

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,010
as external libraries impossible let's

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:53,429
do let's have a seer to do requirements

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:56,850
it does ring a bell

00:19:53,429 --> 00:20:00,039
those are simply pythons as features

00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:03,039
readable executable server code

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,049
it's very agile and it's portable it

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:08,320
comes with batteries we all know that

00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:11,049
and because it comes batteries we don't

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:16,629
have to keep track of a lot of external

00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:18,519
and then how if you tried to to get

00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:21,210
Python in the enterprise you know you

00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:24,720
will going to find some resistance

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:29,379
definitely yes I know it's right and

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:32,590
what what kind of argument or partner

00:20:29,379 --> 00:20:36,129
owned us apart it wasn't so keen what

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:39,609
kind of argument did I use well it's the

00:20:36,129 --> 00:20:44,799
Java oh I know it's not Java that's why

00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:49,059
I want to use it so how did how how did

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:52,840
I counter this argument well of course

00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:56,980
you can show them the usual use cases

00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:59,619
you see a Google user sit and an IOM as

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:04,179
well and yes that works up to a point

00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:06,730
what I did was just implement a first

00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:10,299
prototype of the system which sort of

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:14,710
work it and then oh yes oh this is nice

00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:17,830
but you got this wrong you got so my

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,049
advice what I call the first low of

00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,779
Python focuses shut up and show them a

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:24,639
prototype that working Berlin of course

00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:28,710
it's not myself three months shut up I

00:21:24,639 --> 00:21:31,389
show them the code and then this works

00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,710
because python is very capable of

00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:35,169
promoting itself

00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,739
whilst they can see we know how fast it

00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:41,350
is they don't so show them and a few

00:21:38,739 --> 00:21:44,200
weeks ago some time something happened

00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,450
that was beyond my wildest expectations

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,019
some guy coming from the hardware stuff

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:53,289
which is another city came and said oh

00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:56,619
yes we drink stress tests for components

00:21:53,289 --> 00:22:00,100
we do them in Python what yeah I saw

00:21:56,619 --> 00:22:04,850
easy use for arranged and if not it's

00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:10,550
easy indeed and I didn't suggest that

00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:12,230
it was bison they they have so how so

00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:18,730
that's the zero slope at a rock so you

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:22,070
already so how did how did it work

00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:25,310
this is the part of the project in which

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:29,120
we use spider which is 90% so I'll show

00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:31,940
you just a few snapshots around to to to

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,400
give a quick idea how the drivers a lot

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:37,010
of hardware different systems framers

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,670
and the barcode reader on the printer

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:42,920
and whatnot so by serial Python USB

00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,620
there's a lot of stuff in Python if

00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,300
there is not just user types we're

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:54,290
talking about machines that have

00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:55,820
operational model ax C that is mechanics

00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:58,610
because it's in second so who cares

00:22:55,820 --> 00:23:00,230
about their overhead we used the model

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,440
struct which is fantastic and now you

00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:08,360
have a lady talk at 6:30 if you want to

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:11,630
come and so they had they had just this

00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:16,310
nice the best thing is they had for free

00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:18,650
the fighter shall because we implemented

00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:21,650
all the low-level comments using struct

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,750
and we encapsulated them into a class

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,790
and then we we did what

00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,580
Alex Martell is having the keynote we

00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:31,370
build over that the first level that was

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,800
one to one hardware we built second

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,530
level third level higher level API since

00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,490
so just opening the Python shell and

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,350
it's not yet in the class they had

00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:44,810
console that could drive the hardware

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,790
which was very cool a synchronous

00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:49,430
messages neural networking if you

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:51,830
remember the project diagram pretend to

00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:54,140
do if you don't there was in the middle

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,910
something called the dispatcher that

00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,830
emerges from refactoring because

00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,830
everyone was talking with everyone else

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:03,680
which is never a good idea so we put

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,990
this thing in the middle that passes

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,910
message around and so on a support and

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,060
they must be doing a synchronous way

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:13,550
because the system can't just hang when

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:17,600
when when you when you where you have an

00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:18,389
exam coming in so how do we solve it

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:27,929
twist

00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:33,239
of course I think it's only we all about

00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:36,539
30 minutes anyway twisted is one of

00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:39,449
fightin killer apps I'll see you get

00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:41,369
over the headache you can actually write

00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:43,919
new protocols in minutes and in a few

00:24:41,369 --> 00:24:47,729
lines of code which is very cool

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:50,599
if non-blocking than a synchronous it

00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:52,859
means that it was the way we wanted to

00:24:50,599 --> 00:24:56,419
it's very robust and quite scalable

00:24:52,859 --> 00:25:00,029
that's why it that's why it's a crop and

00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:02,759
we could do another cool thing as you

00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:07,589
see now we decided to do web

00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:10,139
applications and we we had initially to

00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:13,559
use two pack to package Apache which is

00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:16,379
quite a deployment II forced to do but

00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,499
we twisted it was very easy just to get

00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:24,449
rid of Pasha and serve jungle stuff to

00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:27,209
eat with WSGI is it's very easy to you

00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:29,039
and you will have SSL which is very

00:25:27,209 --> 00:25:32,009
important because we don't want patient

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,689
data to to to go in the clear and we

00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:37,709
have examined RPC and we have stopped

00:25:33,689 --> 00:25:43,469
all for free you just add sub class and

00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:47,729
you have xml-rpc so applications why we

00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:50,129
did web maps well no deployment no claim

00:25:47,729 --> 00:25:53,239
like maintenance no no working on

00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:55,169
windows 7 windows 98 windows whatever

00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:57,839
just use a browser

00:25:55,169 --> 00:26:01,379
okay just use everything except internet

00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:04,529
explorer 6 and you you can do pretty

00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:07,319
good interface nowadays with with Ajax

00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:09,149
and so and the kind of technologies and

00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:11,549
that's important because giving the

00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:14,669
users the lab the laboratory technicians

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:17,249
good feedback is key for avoiding most

00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:23,249
common errors and we the jungle of

00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:26,429
course it has its own king with some

00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:29,679
kind of we see actually but you can

00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:31,660
separates models from viewers and you

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,690
can reuse stuff so it's very enterprise

00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,990
and it's very useful even outside the

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:40,840
web we ended up using Django so I ran

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:46,000
for other for other stuff as well for

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,460
instance using it to manage the the tube

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,059
levels cap collars association with

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:55,110
chemicals and and and to dimensions and

00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:57,400
so on because you don't need every

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:00,880
everything of channel you can just use

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,760
as much on as few Django as as well

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,580
which is why loose coupling is always a

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:09,250
good idea just the opposite of soap if

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:14,620
you if you had the chance to use it

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:18,010
dope was this monopolize your attention

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:21,760
just if some screenshots there quite

00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:24,190
ancient it nice or now this is the

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,230
application users by the machine

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,169
administrator there are a lot of data

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:34,390
about what's going on at low level and

00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:37,240
this is an example of what what the

00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:43,630
dinars the phlebotomist see when in this

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:48,520
case to be sprinting and there's more

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:52,690
because ihe does in Asia in Europe and

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:56,020
in the USA an event called connected on

00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:59,200
which principle is if your system is

00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:01,360
really compliant to standards then you

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,280
should be able to connect to other

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,289
systems without knowing where they are

00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:07,480
let's connect the phone it's a blind

00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:09,549
connect we took everything from extra

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,610
table and then in the end you'll see

00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:14,740
what is really really a sauna compliant

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:18,580
and apparently our system which has a

00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:20,950
lots of Python it was compliant so we

00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:24,070
are we are certified as a nation

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:26,289
compliant and there's more in this this

00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:28,900
very moment we're doing an

00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:31,809
experimentation over the machines for

00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:35,200
the whole system in the biggest hospital

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:37,179
of Sardinia which has more than 2,000

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,790
people in staff which serves more than

00:28:37,179 --> 00:28:43,170
30 thousand Asia

00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:45,060
yeah which is a very high-tech hospital

00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:48,780
they have out laboratory automation and

00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:52,980
and so this the system is being used to

00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:55,560
securely do the blood drawing the

00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,860
phlebotomy the phlebotomy process in the

00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:01,110
hospital so yes it was a success

00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:06,540
Python usage in this instance has

00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:09,440
working for us but but well if you want

00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,330
to keep using Python in the healthcare

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:17,850
there are something that are not quite

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:21,030
ok it was recently established at Python

00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:25,830
after special interest group which is

00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:29,040
cool it was March and there was not so

00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:31,680
much activity later lasted it of week is

00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:35,190
on March and we had less than 20 mail

00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:40,950
message in four months last one being in

00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:43,160
April so quite slow and we need some

00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:47,250
some community support because

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:52,440
healthcare is Java works it's really

00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:55,740
general and we don't have a real hl7

00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:59,240
implementation in Python we have a

00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:02,930
library that does part of version 2 and

00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,400
read only not writing and not even a

00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:07,410
small piece of version 3 which is not

00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:10,230
acceptable if you want Python to work in

00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:13,260
this sector mirth nearthe is the

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:15,240
software I told you about that does the

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:18,420
translations and implements the IT staff

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,240
is made in Java of course and the

00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:25,200
scriptable but in JavaScript using Rhino

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,800
rhino is some sort of translate

00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,990
translation layer between Java and

00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,940
JavaScript you can use Java classes from

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,430
JavaScript why not fight on Jesse

00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,190
because Python that doesn't exist in

00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:41,030
this building so what can we do

00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:44,970
first of all we must work together I

00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:48,600
know I know that Python in healthcare is

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:51,030
not very we are not hundreds ok but

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,320
there are some cases this is this is one

00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,660
use case with

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:59,160
with a child which was worth something

00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:01,740
to go has shown another nice one and so

00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,890
we must just stick together and work

00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,860
together because we will never have an

00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:10,200
hl7 implementation for instance if you

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:14,550
work everyone on its own it's very

00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:17,880
complex standard and how very nice ICT

00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:20,280
is very important philosophically it's

00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:22,560
clear but even economically because it's

00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:26,190
a big sector lots of money going in it

00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,270
could be strategic for pricing and in

00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,010
the Western world you know the

00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:31,980
population is getting older there's

00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:33,990
especially true in Italy but in Japan

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,520
too for instance so investments are

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:42,450
going to glow and I think we need to two

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:44,940
things we could use my first flow of

00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:49,350
advocacy we could do prototypes for

00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:51,150
instance for deploying already existing

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,510
software for instance for mirth myth is

00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:56,220
configured using using XML files

00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:58,620
we are served for we're going to do some

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,780
Python script to automate that part so

00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,060
you just start to introduce some Python

00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:07,310
code inside the healthcare environment

00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:11,970
and healthcare ICT professionals very

00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:16,170
nice and and of course we should have a

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:18,720
good list of serious use cases Python

00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:21,210
healthcare because that's some something

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,950
the industry wants we don't want it to

00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,680
be the first to try it in such a

00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:28,280
mission-critical environment but if you

00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,320
have there's a threshold effect you know

00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,930
if you it's the same for technology

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,120
adoption one for the world not very

00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:39,150
useful even if you like yourself very

00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,040
much but not very useful to false could

00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:44,760
be useful if the other phone is does not

00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:48,540
belong to some boring person 20 holes

00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,610
are much better 2004 to millions for

00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:53,070
everyone I'll start by a forum because

00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:59,180
it's so useful so we need to work on it

00:32:53,070 --> 00:33:01,760
and allow me just lasts

00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:05,060
last thought I've been programming

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,520
Python for the last 10 years or so I've

00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:11,300
been removed media a government and ERP

00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:13,340
CRM and well I must admit this field

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:18,050
I'm not real rhetoric but it's special

00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:20,810
because it has such a direct impact and

00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:24,500
it's doubly so if you can do it in

00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:27,290
Python you all know why so I I'd like

00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:30,140
you as a community to help me to keep

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:46,990
doing how they're sitting by thank you

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:46,990
for listening and if you have questions

00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:59,780
yes when you mention the reasons why you

00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:01,700
decided to use Python you said that in

00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:03,470
the team you had people that weren't

00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:07,720
developers does this mean that these

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:07,720
people read the code and write code or

00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,580
yes they do like the example I gave you

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,040
about Mechanical Engineers using Python

00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:21,920
to do stress tests because it becomes

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,410
you know to learn Python for such a task

00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:27,350
you you only it only gets if you have a

00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:29,870
few hours but if you use Java maybe it's

00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:33,020
more difficult but all goal was not

00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,810
everyone will be writing code but just

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:38,780
we must have must have something that

00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:42,530
you can show and they can get the

00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:44,930
general idea is it ok if it works that

00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,410
way if the if that part of the machine

00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:50,060
moves then these other things happened

00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:53,330
you know python is quite a go from that

00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:55,130
point of view and I imagine the large

00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:59,690
team including your in the sole partner

00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:02,420
and oh but yes what with what I wanted

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,520
was what we wanted was people can read

00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:06,440
the code and have a general idea what's

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,990
happened was people started to use

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,900
Python to write Unicode which is very

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:12,930
cool when I see non developers using

00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,690
Python to

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:16,230
stuff because it's it's quite easy to do

00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:24,540
it

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:29,089
it's always nice other questions you

00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,089
