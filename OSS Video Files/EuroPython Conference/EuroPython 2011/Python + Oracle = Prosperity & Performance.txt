this is actually new for me I've never

00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,690
done a teaser talk so I actually commend

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:12,410
Europe ifen for the concept even it's

00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:15,589
it's very interesting so what I'm going

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,170
to try and do here is give you just the

00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:20,720
bare basics of what i will be doing

00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:22,220
tomorrow try and point you too much

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,350
thing if we don't have the internet i

00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,540
won't be able to cover a lot of the

00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,270
stuff there but the key thing really is

00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,760
going to be this DVD have everybody gone

00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,730
by my desk over there and picked up one

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,100
of these dvds with the VirtualBox image

00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,719
okay if you haven't this I still have a

00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:42,620
bunch of them I've kept some of them

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,780
behind as well so after this just by my

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,969
desk as you walk out along there I've

00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,460
got some DVDs here the other one that if

00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:52,579
you came by yesterday you won't have is

00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,309
this one over here so first my apologies

00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:58,780
I'm Todd richer I'm with Oracle being

00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:01,249
with Oracle about 14 years last like

00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,019
probably about six years I've done

00:01:01,249 --> 00:01:05,449
everything from engaging Java user

00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,610
groups to PHP user groups to linux user

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,130
groups and now I'm getting into the

00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:13,040
Python user user group community so I've

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:14,750
been to Europe Python this is my icon it

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,110
I put up in the abstract second time but

00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,299
I realize it was my third time twice in

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,270
Birmingham and now here Florence is just

00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:25,340
a great city any city that can organize

00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,649
for me to sit next to your 400-meter

00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,509
Women's Champion on my flight from

00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:35,240
Frankfurt to Florence deserve some

00:01:29,509 --> 00:01:37,549
credit so yeah Chiara Kiara when I see

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,430
or was a butcher or last name but anyway

00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:43,219
she won the first in the 400 up in

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:45,140
Stockholm Sweden she said yeah I run so

00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,570
I say well what race you know do you I

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:50,299
knew she was a you know sports sports

00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:53,539
thing just two girls dressed in italia

00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,250
type output sponsored looking really

00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:56,539
like people that actually knew like what

00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,399
they were doing exercising i said

00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:00,140
there's soccer players or something like

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,590
that turns out she's the 400 meter

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,130
champion she starts off the first leg of

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,020
the 400 meter relay and in the race

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,080
offense calm i was just up in my room

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,989
and I saw the actual replay of the vent

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,800
and she won the first year 400 meters

00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:17,660
she was like

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,660
first one out of the bat bat in hand and

00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:26,840
so she did her country proud so that was

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:30,590
my expert experience of Florence that it

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:34,090
was and then needless to say also first

00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:36,080
taxi driver that was a woman so I

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,960
probable approved probably I don't know

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,580
20 years in that and I have to come

00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,880
halfway around the world end up in Italy

00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:45,470
to have meet a woman taxi driver which

00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,890
was neat because she said about twenty

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:50,330
to twenty-five percent was actually his

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,890
woman here which is amazing because

00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:55,430
that's a credit to the city because it's

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:57,020
obviously pretty safe city well with

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,140
that said you didn't come to hear about

00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:02,390
how great Florence was this is this one

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,250
here is the culmination of about three

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,590
years of me bugging development and

00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,420
engineering so I got the database

00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:10,160
development team at Oracle to build me a

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,990
virtualbox damage with all of their

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,930
hands on labs for all of the Oracle

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:18,970
database stuff in that I then got the

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,410
guy that the PHP community to add in his

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,170
performance demos on the same virtual

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:27,260
image and as of literally three weeks

00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:29,600
ago I got the first Python guide for

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,489
using CX Oracle and that installed on

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,570
the same image so that's what this

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:38,330
virtual box image is here I'll show you

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,640
in terms of just the the setup it's

00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:45,980
going to be basically you just you know

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,739
pull it up if you how many of you and I

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:51,560
just get an indication of how many of

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,700
you guys actually use Oracle in your in

00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:57,590
your operation somewhere in your

00:03:52,700 --> 00:04:00,140
business okay okay excellent what

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:07,160
version of Python are you guys using is

00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:11,480
it mainly 24 25 26 27 okay 26 okay

00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:13,610
mainly 26 27 okay anybody doing 30 stuff

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,090
yet I know that the CX driver supports

00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,739
it anybody not yet okay Wesley did say

00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:21,260
that you probably want to wait till you

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:23,660
port that and if it's raw racal database

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,820
obviously you do want to make sure that

00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:28,300
it's stable and that before you do the

00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,300
next jump

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:39,610
the what you'll see on this DVD is you

00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,020
have a basically a virtualbox image the

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,650
one that you're going to care about is

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:48,160
I've got two players here the mac player

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,320
and the windows player so how many of

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,260
you have run virtual box before are

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,780
familiar with virtualbox okay couple of

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,300
people not familiar with it virtual box

00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,700
is very similar to the vmware server so

00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,380
if you're familiar with desktop

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,470
virtualization virtual box is exactly

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:08,710
like that okay it runs as an application

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,660
on top of your existing OS so in this

00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,360
case I happen to be running a linux

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,340
version kubuntu on my laptop and then

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,669
I'm running virtual box on top of that

00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:21,100
and then you will install the VirtualBox

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:24,790
image the appliance into that virtual

00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,590
box if you have the option between

00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:29,440
running it on windows and running it on

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,960
linux or mac run it on linux or mac as a

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,720
host a virtual box is just a lot faster

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,610
on on that then then it's i mean it

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,520
works fine right on when doesn't that it

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,229
just it's a little bit faster and we did

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,750
notice with one guy last night that

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,900
windows sometimes on the memory side

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,410
hugs more memory than linux would on

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:56,680
that so just something to take on on

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:59,590
that with the the what you're going to

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,539
do then is install either unfortunately

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,729
i only had limited space in the DVD so

00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:05,590
i've got windows and mac there if you're

00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,740
running it on linux what you're going to

00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:10,960
want to do is go to virtualbox org ok so

00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:13,990
VirtualBox just like on the DVD it has

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,060
VirtualBox just add org go to it you can

00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:23,280
download any flavor ubuntu gentoo Ubuntu

00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:25,300
Fedora you know you name it Oracle

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,660
there's there's several different ones

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,430
there the other DVD that you did not see

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,470
yesterday if you came around the table

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:37,360
is this one here which is oracle linux

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:38,680
to oracle linux 5 release 6 64 bit we do

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,409
encourage people if they're running

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,649
oracle use 64 bit

00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:47,050
on Linux okay it is going to be a lot

00:06:44,649 --> 00:06:50,739
faster both arcolin lenox you 64-bit

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,929
well the image itself is actually 32 bit

00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:55,209
but it doesn't really matter i mean it's

00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:56,649
a test environment that just happened to

00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:01,330
be what what the guys were using at the

00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:07,169
time so when you actually do your

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,169
install of that will go here

00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,729
the this is the one problem with giving

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,699
it to development and telling them to

00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:30,389
slap him my Python guide in and give me

00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:32,849
a new export right before i leave you

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,099
don't get the getting started PDF that

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:40,319
was on the previous version of the DVD

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:42,210
ok so this nice little duck here which

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,099
basically walks you through the

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:47,190
installation of the VirtualBox part of

00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:49,319
it isn't on the DVD itself if anybody

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,300
isn't familiar with the VirtualBox image

00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,550
please you know tomorrow during during

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,580
the training I can walk you through it

00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,620
we can get get it all up and running but

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,750
and then we can get your copy of this

00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,099
but basically it just walks you through

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,050
if you're familiar with the VirtualBox

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,849
part of it literally all you're doing is

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:09,240
you're downloading the latest VirtualBox

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:11,880
one the image you don't have to do this

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,300
step which because that VM image is on

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,680
the DVD that I'm giving you guys when

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,610
you get to it you're just going to do

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,500
sup file import appliance and then you

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,979
choose and you're going to select the

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:28,080
ovf file which is the only oviya file in

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:31,669
the root DVD so what that would look

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,110
like is once you install VirtualBox

00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:38,880
you'll get an icon that looks like that

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:41,190
and this part now is the same whether

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,659
you do it on Linux Mac Windows whatever

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,810
because you're now in your virtual box

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,089
manager the first time you install

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,970
VirtualBox manager you're not going to

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:52,410
see anything over here ok this air in

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,029
here will be completely blank because

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,040
you don't have any guests machines

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,110
installed yet ok you don't have any

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,500
virtual machines installed and then what

00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:07,579
you'll do is you'll do file import

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:17,180
appliance and then it says choose and

00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:19,589
you'll go to or wherever your DVD is and

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,470
you'll see actually I did that really

00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,000
quickly but basically it's the only ovf

00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:25,620
fowler so when it's searching for the

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,500
audio via file if you've got if that's

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,790
the only DVD you have in your DVD player

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,030
that's what you're going to get one of

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,650
the guys said that he had a problem with

00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,150
he didn't have a DVD player here because

00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,580
he's only got a netbook or something

00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:41,360
like that I copied the whole DVD on to a

00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:43,550
16 gig USB flash drive that I have so if

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,440
any of you are in a similar situation we

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,900
can take care of you tomorrow morning on

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,930
that as well you would choose choose

00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,210
that one and then you just hit next I'm

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,460
not going to do that because i've

00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:57,110
already installed it basically you wait

00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:00,710
there and what it does during that time

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,740
is it will sit there and it creates a 15

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,300
gig file on your hard drive okay so

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,970
that's what it uses to create this

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,470
virtual environment so in terms of

00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,750
resources what you're going to need to

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:15,820
run this virtual image is two gigs of

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:21,560
ram and 15 gigs of space ok gracias

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:23,270
gratzi sorry and then at the end of it

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:26,330
you'll get this Oracle developer days

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:29,930
and it will be powered off okay at that

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,430
point in time you can start it up and it

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,100
will say the first message comes up

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,870
windows bot is the right ctrl key the

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,760
control key on the right hand side of

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,190
the board that is the one that you can

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,680
toggle between your guest environment

00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:46,700
which is at this point in time this area

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:48,500
here and you're outside host existing so

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,420
everything outside of this window here

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,880
now is going to be that guest

00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:54,650
environment to get back and forth from

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,530
that you can just use that control key

00:10:54,650 --> 00:11:01,760
to to basically remove cursor control

00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:05,030
okay the first time through the virtual

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,640
machine I'll show you guys there's a way

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,820
that you can actually add this

00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:14,420
additional like user toolkit so the

00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,420
VirtualBox extensions that on most Oasis

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,680
will allow you to just mouse over

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,830
directly back and forth and it will

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:28,640
automatically know which window you're

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:30,260
working on based upon that the and and

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,770
so you'll have to do that once and then

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:36,050
for most oasis in terms of your host OSS

00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,820
that will just be fine and it'll work

00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:42,980
work right on that when you actually

00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,400
look at the the guest OS your loss to

00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:49,430
see over here

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:52,230
the settings so when you're working with

00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:54,030
virtualbox you can actually come in here

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,620
and check out all of your settings when

00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,690
it's powered down you can actually

00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,030
change these settings say look I'm going

00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:03,390
to give it more bass memory than it

00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:05,280
existing is that 900 Meg's is actually

00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,370
pretty close to the bare minimum that

00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:10,950
this machine is going to use okay reason

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:14,490
being is got a full-blown 11gr2

00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:16,680
Enterprise Edition database plus all the

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,690
hands-on labs press the sample scheme as

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:25,260
everything that a oracle DBA would use

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:27,660
once that's so you can change that this

00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:31,400
is kind of the key one here the network

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:35,070
adapter this one here will inherit the

00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:37,140
resources of the underlying host OS so

00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:39,780
it will get if I have internet connected

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,610
on my host laptop I can have internet

00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:46,310
running in my guest machine by using

00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:46,310
that one there it will just pass through

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:13,529
once this come when you get to the the

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:20,470
login for the virtual machine you'll see

00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:24,579
that's not what I want you to do okay

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:27,699
here we go the first login prompt the

00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:30,160
character base just like type rot don't

00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:34,499
log in there wait for it to get to the

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,550
GUI prompt once it gets the GUI prompt

00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:38,800
you'll see something that looks like

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:41,679
this so this is now Oracle Linux 5

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,959
update 5 basically that's exactly the

00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,240
same as red hat enterprise linux 5

00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:47,589
update 5 with an additional colonel so

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,149
you have one completely red hat

00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:50,800
compatible carnal and you have an

00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:52,660
additional unbreakable enterprise kernel

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,069
which is basically more performant that

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:59,279
one goes directly off of main line

00:13:54,069 --> 00:14:03,069
source code the password oracle oracle

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,889
lowercase that's what you would have

00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:07,749
known if that helped start H PDF file

00:14:05,889 --> 00:14:10,209
had been in the root of the DVD k so

00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:11,619
it's kind of important to read that yeah

00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:13,749
that's the only piece you need to know

00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:16,089
outside of understanding how virtual box

00:14:13,749 --> 00:14:17,679
works to get this up and running after

00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:20,290
that point you actually have all the

00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,600
guides inside the virtual box so this

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,100
now is a complete image running on top

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,410
of whatever host you're running it in

00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,569
it's running oracle linux here you can

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:30,939
see it's got the complete enterprise

00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:33,160
data base running here you've got sample

00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:34,749
reset scripts to reset your labs if

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:44,559
you've done them and want to redo the

00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:48,309
labs you've got over here in the are we

00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:54,879
done five minutes yeah okay so here we

00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:57,549
have the hands-on lab so this is the

00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,799
complete hands-on labs from the Oracle

00:14:57,549 --> 00:15:01,299
development team oracle apex is a quick

00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,399
and dirty rapid application development

00:15:01,299 --> 00:15:06,999
environment the whole thing runs inside

00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,189
your database you can deploy it and ran

00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:13,360
in and develop it through a browser

00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:15,970
okay sequel developer is a quick and

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,410
dirty database management tool you can

00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:19,509
use it for mysql

00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:23,949
you can use it for Oracle even Microsoft

00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:26,350
sequel server obviously the capabilities

00:15:23,949 --> 00:15:30,040
and sequel developer aren't as developed

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:34,569
for mice say like MySQL workbench as it

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:38,589
is for Oracle yet how many of you guys

00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:43,480
have mysql in your accounts or running

00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:45,220
it okay okay if i might be able to get a

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,500
performance engineer come give a talk on

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,300
that next time so if there's enough

00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:52,800
interested in that just make it make it

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:56,500
aware and giovanni can let me know the

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,389
in-memory database cash is x 10 so it's

00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,949
it's in-memory database it's already

00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:01,870
integrated with the existing enterprise

00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:04,089
database this is an architecture that a

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,370
lot of telecoms use if you need sub

00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:09,040
second response times this is a great

00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,990
way of doing it xml DB pretty

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,350
self-explanatory so you've got hands-on

00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:17,439
labs for each one of those this one here

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,800
is actually PHP and oracle database it's

00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:22,420
basically a performance examples of how

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,029
to do performance so if you know

00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,279
anything about PHP you can actually see

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:29,230
where where those those features are

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,819
this is where I kind of feel a little

00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,009
bit bad because i don't have the pipe

00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:36,069
and resources to the same level as the

00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:38,170
PHP resources yet on this DVD I mean

00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:40,060
this is my first foray into this so

00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,949
hopefully I can bump into some guys that

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,769
know python really well that can help me

00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:47,620
get this a little bit further along the

00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:49,600
Python side is here so this is my guide

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,819
that i put together to help people get

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,759
up and running we do have a bunch of

00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:56,410
resources on OT n which is Oracle

00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:00,639
technology Network that's what I work

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:02,860
for and so a bunch of technical articles

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,829
on Python and that Anthony two ninjas

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:09,069
article on using CX article his website

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:12,010
is phenomenal resource just really

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,490
really good stuff here it goes through

00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:18,339
from here setting up the environment

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,230
running it on mac windows download this

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:22,240
version so this is what we should one

00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,579
thing i did tell you is that the first

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:30,230
time when it comes up it will step you

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:35,120
through here but it will say to come to

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:36,320
you've done all of this here so you'll

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,299
be prompted to install the latest

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,830
VirtualBox guest additions you should do

00:17:38,299 --> 00:17:42,500
this by doing the install guest

00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:45,230
additions host d that's right here under

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,540
devices and still guest additions

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,850
thirsty okay that's the one that gives

00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,710
you things like okay connecting your USB

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,290
driving and getting access to it and

00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,059
have being able to mouse over the window

00:17:54,290 --> 00:18:00,530
without having to do control every time

00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:02,240
to get regain cursor control the then

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,690
the part that is of particular interest

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,059
to the Python side of the house is once

00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:11,960
you've got all of that done you're going

00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:14,030
to need to work out what your linux

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,690
version is in this case I know what the

00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:22,250
Linux version is ok it's a 32 bit linux

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:23,660
version it's RPM based so that's that's

00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:25,100
one of the things yeah the other thing

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,780
you need to know is what version of the

00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:32,450
database when you're choosing your 6

00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:40,910
driver so that is I'm talking about

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:43,549
something that I'm not showing you so CX

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,190
article and here's where I give a huge

00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:48,230
shout out to Anthony to ninga ok yeah

00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:50,960
this is a community guy he has nothing

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:53,630
to do with Oracle he just uses Oracle in

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,970
his workplace he developed it basically

00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:00,049
to help him out and he does a phenomenal

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:02,240
job ok and with that I just got the stop

00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:06,110
sign so i'll show you right over here

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,150
basically go to CSX forge this is

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,340
something that's kind of a good thing

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:13,100
you want to do if you're doing it before

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:15,890
tomorrow morning because the network is

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:19,070
iffy you want to do this section of it

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:22,429
try and get the downloaded into your

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:24,850
thing and with that we have it ok so

00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:27,559
it's right here everything's that guys

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,350
love to help you out if anybody comes on

00:19:27,559 --> 00:19:32,540
Thursday if anybody came in late I've

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,070
