okay good to see you all here so this is

00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,520
a teaser talk for tomorrow's training

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:17,109
session so tomorrow I'm going to be

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:21,220
taking whoever turns up through a little

00:00:17,109 --> 00:00:22,330
bit of n thoughts training in using some

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:25,510
of the some of the pieces of the N

00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:27,610
thought tool suite okay so this talk has

00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:30,100
two purposes one is to tell you what to

00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,570
expect tomorrow if you come the other is

00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,890
actually just to introduce people to the

00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,629
import tool suite because I think a lot

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,289
of people don't know that it exists and

00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:40,089
it's a truly wonderful piece of software

00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:41,800
when I was hired by and thought about a

00:00:40,089 --> 00:00:43,539
year ago so I went through all the

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,100
interviews and idea every stage of the

00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:47,079
interview they were asking have you used

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,679
traits have you used the in thought tool

00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,479
suite no no no what is that and the more

00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,879
time somebody asks the more I thought I

00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,440
really need to point out what this is

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,510
and in the last year of course I've been

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,579
living in living in here so we build all

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:07,539
our applications using the import tool

00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:09,340
suite okay so those of you who haven't

00:01:07,539 --> 00:01:11,259
heard in thoughts name we're in the

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:13,060
business of creating scientific

00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:17,020
sometimes financial mostly scientific

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,159
applications using Python these are

00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,439
typically applications that involve a

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,899
lot of calculation so a lot of numerics

00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:27,789
so we have a mathematicians scientists

00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:29,409
in our core team but they're also often

00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:31,929
applications that require a nice

00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:34,679
graphical front end so a lot of what we

00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:37,210
do is also sticking on nice gooeys or

00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:40,780
creating gooeys that can sit on top of

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:44,049
the data back end and blood pretty which

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:45,249
don't give these are supposed to do so

00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:48,609
our tool chain looks a little bit like

00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:51,969
this we work with Python 2.7 mostly

00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:54,100
sometimes 2.6 mostly 2.7 working with

00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:56,740
numpy and scifi so of course and thought

00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,899
is heavily involved in the non Pines

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,649
hyper development we have many of the

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,999
key numpy people on our team and in the

00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:08,050
hotel suite which is what I'm here to

00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:10,060
talk about and I would be lying if I

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:12,460
didn't say we also of course use endless

00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,840
third-party libraries so for any given

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,740
project you're going to be using a whole

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,210
bunch of other things be

00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:21,100
these but these are these are the three

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:22,720
core things we use so the tool suite

00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,550
itself is open source you can get it for

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,670
free so free as in beer free as in

00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:30,340
speech bsd like license it's kind of

00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,470
large so half a million lines of code so

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:35,530
it's not nothing okay it's not huge but

00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,850
it's not nothing here are a couple of

00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,720
addresses you can get it from if you

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,980
want to you can go straight to in

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,200
thoughts site and you'll be able to

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,810
navigate and download it from there or

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,480
you can go straight to get up so

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,220
github.com / and thought yes we have the

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,260
mercurial gets help argument at some

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,820
point late last year and it did go on

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:56,620
for absolutely ages but in the end

00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,640
everything ended up on get so and flesh

00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:02,890
news ETS 4.0 was released yesterday so

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,140
major new release of ets yesterday it

00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,610
actually didn't change a whole lot what

00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,690
we've done is shifted some of the

00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,290
packages around there were some

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:13,570
namespace issues but we wanted to fix

00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:15,040
and because of all that shifting around

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,780
there's a greater probability of things

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:25,270
breaking and so we decided to bump the

00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:26,770
version up from three to four okay do

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:28,510
feel free to ask questions at any point

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,750
don't have to wait till the end of the

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:34,440
talk oh alright so here there's some of

00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:37,600
the key in thought tool suite components

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,920
traits traits is what I'm going to spend

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,270
most of the rest of today talking about

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,820
and what a large push on the training

00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,230
tomorrow will be about traits is where

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,090
we all live all the projects we create a

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:50,290
built on top of traits I think without

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,250
exception so traits it's about type

00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,540
technically it's about a whole lot of

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,700
things that's very difficult to compress

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,940
all the ideas into a few things it's

00:03:54,700 --> 00:04:02,440
about type declarations about validation

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,660
about notification on top of trades we

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,720
have traits key traits GUI how traits

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:10,510
you I and its job is to reduce ugly you

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:12,580
is very very fast so the idea is you can

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:14,830
produce you is with really really

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,330
minimal effort and we'll see we'll see

00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,640
an example of this a couple of examples

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:23,500
and you can create beautiful you eyes

00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,690
it's just they take a little bit of work

00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,110
so you can get your ugly you I up there

00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,330
and running within a half a day

00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,229
a beautiful you I okay now you're going

00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,330
to be wanting to mess around with the

00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:34,849
layout for quite a while and get

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,409
everything looking beautiful but so that

00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:38,210
rapid development rapid deployment we

00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:43,219
get something that works very very fast

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:47,030
now you're tweaked to make checo is our

00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:49,340
interactive 2d plotting tool really

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,259
provides high interactivity deals with

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,759
large data sets it's rather more

00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:55,909
responsive and something like map Claude

00:04:52,759 --> 00:05:00,800
lip so we'll see a quick demo of that

00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:02,120
and my RV is a 3d visualization tool

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,969
it's actually you can use it either as a

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,159
standalone tool to visualize data or you

00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:08,840
can embed it into trades based

00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:16,789
applications and have three of you is

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:18,500
embedded in that so okay so straighten

00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,719
the traits I just want to give you a

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,069
flavor of what traits is about like I

00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:24,439
said it's difficult to encapsulate in a

00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,819
few words here's the bad old way of

00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,050
doing things we want to create a pair of

00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:32,210
class so parents have a state that

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,039
either alive or dead or possibly just

00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:37,339
resting or pushing up the daisies or

00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:38,960
whatever and they have a weight just

00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:40,430
because I wanted to have well we

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,129
typically deal with numeric applications

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,139
I wanted something numeric to show you

00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:48,020
so they've got a weight in kilograms

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,069
because we're all metric here and

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,330
there's a method which we haven't

00:05:49,069 --> 00:05:54,469
actually implemented well make that do

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:56,089
something later called a boom you want

00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:58,310
your power to boom well this parrot

00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:03,289
wouldn't boo go boom if all right you

00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:05,599
know the rest okay bad old way of doing

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,219
it you've got your init method so you

00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:09,259
know you want to state in a way to pass

00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:11,199
those into the inner constructor you

00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:15,800
assign them as attributes on the object

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,020
and then i instantiate like this so now

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:22,099
i'm creating my parrot it's bad it's got

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,779
a way to 3.2 okay the first thing that

00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:26,120
traits is so so over on the right-hand

00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:28,039
side this is the same code modulo some

00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,560
minor differences that turned up a last

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:36,080
minute like volts setting the voltage so

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,690
same code but using traits and the first

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,790
thing you the first way I think of

00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,010
traits is sort of a data description

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,480
which you have this really nice deck

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,160
Laura tipping interface instead of the

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,140
under under in it which is kind of

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,620
procedural pass parameters in assign

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:55,160
them to the objects here I just declare

00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,170
a parrot is going to have a state it's

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,700
going to be a new and enumerated item

00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:00,020
sir een arm comes from the plates

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,520
library there's going to be one of the

00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,480
two strings dead or alive so it's going

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,730
to be a string it's how they're going to

00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,540
be dead or it's going to be alive and

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:08,900
it's going to have a weight and that

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:10,640
weight is going to be a float so it's a

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:13,010
really beautiful decorative way of

00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,060
declaring your data it's it's a and I

00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,830
think this is very attractive to

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,840
scientists so coming in maybe haven't

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,240
met Python before that they can describe

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,600
their object very directly and neatly

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,480
with this model so it's got a status go

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:28,400
to wait and i can again instantiate it

00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,660
one of the curiosities of traits so

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,880
there's obviously some magic going on

00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,550
here lots of descriptors there's a

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,680
metaclass somewhere behind the scenes

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:39,200
one thing you'll know if you're a Python

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,940
expert is this when you create a class

00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,470
it's just rolling up all the pieces of

00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,880
the class into a gigantic and

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:47,240
handing that off to type at some level

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:52,160
Dichter unordered so there's nothing

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,950
here that tells it that state whoa okay

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,810
so recover that state should occur

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,520
before weight or vice versa so what

00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,810
consequences is is you have to use

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,960
keyword you have to pass everything by

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,370
keyword to the bottom here but that's

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,320
actually not too much of a price to pay

00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,240
and especially when it comes to reading

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,910
that code it's really nice to have all

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:17,840
those keywords in there it makes a

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:20,390
difference ok so that's traits how am i

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,770
doing on time she ok about halfway

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,760
through perfect cuz I'm about halfway

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,260
through my slides all right tres gooey

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,730
instant you eyes I guess I promised fast

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,390
you eyes we just upgraded bouncer

00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:34,099
instant you eyes same code up there that

00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,770
same same curve from previous slide I've

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:39,560
added absolutely nothing except to the

00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,080
bottom is my main loop if name equals

00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,230
main I'm creating a parrot i'm calling

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,910
it Polly for no particular reason

00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,070
passing in a weight and then there's

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,770
this one extra call Holly configure

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,470
traits and now what this does is it pops

00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:57,980
up a little you I for my

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:00,860
parrot incidents and this is amazing

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:03,290
I've done nothing to do with you ice

00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,880
here all I've done is described this

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,920
parrot object I haven't said anything

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
about how I want this how I want this to

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:13,550
be displayed but it's constructed a

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,500
little UI for me on the fly and then of

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:17,390
course as soon as you get fussy yes you

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,830
can make things really you can rearrange

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,800
things to your hearts to like Luke

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:25,100
things late you know change the layout

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,330
all sorts of keyword parameters to play

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,770
things in complete different way do I

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:31,400
want check boxes instead of a pulldown

00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:33,620
menu do I want a slider instead of a

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,510
text box that I put the weight in so

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,190
customize your hearts it has to light

00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,330
afterwards but you create you guys

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,820
really quickly and I just wanted to

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,910
prove to you that I'm not lying about

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,320
this so there's that there's that code

00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:51,020
is that actually big enough that

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,470
everybody to see should I just about how

00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,990
about if I just zoom in a tiny bit there

00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:58,880
and so so there's my UI he really does

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,540
work it wasn't just a blind Cambridge

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,070
screenshot I can enter a new weight one

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,050
nice thing here is that you've got

00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,930
automatic validation going on you try to

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,880
enter an invalid weight on the fly its

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:12,590
I'm recognizing that sim valid not it

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,980
won't let you enter it so you see that

00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,510
ok is greyed out my click on ok and if I

00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,130
want to do at that point after that can

00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:20,330
take a trade school my parrot object has

00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:28,180
been initialized I can do whatever I

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:34,670
like with it ok everybody happy ended

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:36,470
I'll set up the contented okay before I

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,110
go back to my so that the rest of my

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,070
slides really are just stand-ins for

00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,900
interactive demos that I wanted to show

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:44,570
you just in case things went bad with

00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:48,860
the interactive demos so here's the next

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:50,210
one one of the other guys on our team

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,200
the info i said this isn't a very

00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:56,960
interesting-looking you I at the very

00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,380
least it needs some pictures so here's

00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,720
just a slight upgrade at the parrot

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,980
demonstration all right we've got a dead

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,790
parrot there's a nice little image of

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,790
dead parrot over there

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:16,529
what can I do sorry ah nothing to do

00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:21,690
with virtual machines yes well true no

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:24,170
it's not dead as I I don't know ok so

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,279
this parrot would not go boom if I I

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:30,870
want to make this parent boom who wants

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,430
to see this power of boom so sorry this

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:35,610
bird wouldn't do if you put four million

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,380
volts through it ok but I've got a

00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:39,110
voltage setting so let's up the voltage

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,260
of it what do we at three million volts

00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:48,360
so let's try 5.2 million volts boom ok

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,760
now gotta live parrot so status alive at

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,320
a picture unfortunately if you try and

00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,320
boom it again that kind of kills it oh

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:01,980
ok so nice little you I there here's the

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:03,720
code that created it ah ok I didn't

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:10,770
actually mean that to end up over there

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:12,930
but that's fine it's tiny so just look

00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,370
good so we've got a bunch of imports up

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,900
at the top so this is all the stuff in

00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,240
the traits library the traits UI library

00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,529
that makes this work pieface in case

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,000
you're wondering is one of the sort of

00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:23,580
subtools that's living underneath that's

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,940
making the UI stuff work it's in charge

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,250
so trace you I uses either w execute

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,570
back end I'm told I supposed to

00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:35,700
pronounce it cute I can't quite get used

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:37,410
to this but and pie face is one of the

00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,310
objects that's in charge of be able to

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:41,760
do anything with either of those

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,290
backends so QT and WX are cross-platform

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:49,579
toolkits we have a cross toolkit

00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:53,250
platform for cross-platform toolkits

00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:55,290
tracy wires but there's there's the

00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,570
whole code well i'll show you the bottom

00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,100
part in a second same as before we've

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,600
got the state's we've got a voltage i

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,810
drop the weight because we've seen that

00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,910
now we've got a button this is just some

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,070
idea of events and i have a method

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,750
called a boom fired so traits hooks up

00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:12,450
some some of these special special

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,649
method names so it recognizes underscore

00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:14,940
room under school fire there's something

00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:16,709
special to boom so whenever you click on

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,829
that button this is the code that that's

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:20,610
executed and if the voltage is big

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:21,899
enough this

00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,149
state flips from alive to dead or back

00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:28,769
again otherwise you get this error

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:30,450
message and then for the images just

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:34,320
three more lines so the image is a

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,519
property it depends on the state and to

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,860
get the image again this is especially

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,510
names method the under get and down the

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,529
image is recognized by traits as

00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:43,380
something that's going to provide this

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:45,000
so whenever the state changes trace goes

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,440
out so everything's hooked up for you

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,480
behind the scenes tres tres goes out

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,660
finds the image positive the image

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,820
straight there so in the dot images

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:58,380
directory error those two images living

00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:01,260
there and that's really it the the rest

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,970
of it was just because I want I decided

00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:04,740
that I wanted that image to the right

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,740
hand side of all the rest rather than

00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,790
below so this is almost all redundant I

00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,880
could have let this out and it was

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:14,010
almost work without this but this is

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,839
just an example of how you how you can

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,980
provide some control of the layout and

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,589
again there are endless options for

00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,890
really fine-tuning this but you see I'm

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:24,899
just I've got a horizontal group and

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:27,029
dividing the layout into two horizontal

00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:28,680
pieces in the left hand piece that's the

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,000
first V group I've got the state the

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,500
voltage in this boom button the right

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,209
hand piece I've got the image so that's

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,709
Tracy why and that and that to me is

00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,420
fantastic you you've got a reactive you

00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:45,170
I hear doing really quite a lot popping

00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:50,399
up error messages all the reactions and

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:55,339
just 40 lines of code I just wanted to

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:57,870
add to that so I launched this from

00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:59,310
ipython another neat thing you can do

00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,600
and we often actually do for our

00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,329
customers is embed a Python interpreter

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,100
inside the UI so that they can interact

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:06,570
with the object directly and of course

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,310
as you'd expect you've got the same

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:12,420
reactive programming idea the parents

00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:14,130
got a state it's dead I can assign to

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:19,709
that now I Paris gone live again

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:21,899
everything's updated and if I try and

00:15:19,709 --> 00:15:26,670
make it just resting ok so this is part

00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,810
of what trades provides validation but

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,130
the state-trait must be dead or alive

00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,550
but a value of just resting with

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,550
specifies

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,630
okay so that's all I'm going to say

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,130
about traits you I and then I just want

00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:42,300
to demonstrate the other two components

00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,580
that I mentioned which are Chaco and my

00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,350
a-v are so are 2d not 3d visualization

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,460
libraries tomorrow we will spend some

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:54,360
time with checker we probably want to

00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:56,550
say too much about my Appy so so here's

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:58,050
a a quick check of example this one's

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,470
actually recently complex is about four

00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:04,410
hundred lines of code underlying this

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,360
and it's just showing that some of the

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,180
things that it's easy to do in so that

00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,120
was that was a fake zoom I was using the

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,240
mac OS tuum there but sorry if i just

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,750
use what would be right what would be

00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,400
the scroll wheel on a on a real computer

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:24,090
you can zoom in on these these plots you

00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,470
can move them around and a very nice

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,700
thing you can do with traits is you can

00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,130
use all the traits and notification

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,960
mechanisms to hook + up to each other so

00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,540
I'm scrolling around on this plot I'm

00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:34,920
seeing the vertical cross sections that

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,650
vertical in the horizontal cross section

00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,300
over there okay so this is a two

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:40,710
dimensional function two inputs one

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:44,010
output for coloring according to the

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:45,750
output over that so a little bit

00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,670
involved but still only 400 lines of

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,610
code which is which is not bad something

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:56,480
like this so that's a function inspector

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:56,480
and then just one example of the my a-v

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:04,980
one unfortunately takes a little bit of

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,689
time to start up seconds so this one

00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,790
this one's under under 200 lines of

00:17:06,689 --> 00:17:10,370
Python code and again shows the power of

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,689
some of some of this some of these tools

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:16,410
does take some time to learn to use them

00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:18,810
properly so this is showing the Lorenz

00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:23,250
attractor this famous butterfly chaotic

00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:25,589
attractor so what's happening over here

00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:27,959
on the left hand side is we're pulling

00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,390
out so we've got the standard set of

00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,640
equations that create this attractor

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:34,980
there's a little ball here whose

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,060
vertices serve as the initial points for

00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,920
the flows and then it's following the

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,830
flow lines and showing the flow lines

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,810
and updating all that in real time and

00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:45,270
there are various parameters in these

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:46,120
equations so with all the trait stuff so

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,780
your little slider here

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,570
allows you to change the parameters and

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,890
then not quite instantly but after after

00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,160
a little bit of calculation updates the

00:17:53,890 --> 00:18:01,270
flow and you can even start editing the

00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:03,370
equations what happens if this is y

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:04,300
minus x times e instead of Y minus X

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,000
well probably I'm going to get something

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,830
entirely uninteresting but you can do

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,150
that I do get something pretty

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:14,500
uninteresting but it's a really nice way

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:15,790
of just being able to build things

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,290
quickly have that high degree of

00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:20,980
interactivity sitting on top of whatever

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,270
computational work you've done I bring

00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,070
something presentable that people who

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,950
don't understand all the ins and out so

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,020
the computation can use but this is very

00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:31,450
much though or the model we frequently

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,770
see it n thought you you have one or two

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,630
experts who really understand the

00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:35,590
calculation domain and then they want

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,570
great software that they're going to

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:42,000
hand off to people who just want to put

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:48,100
in the inputs get out the outputs okay

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,600
so tomorrow we will go through traits

00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:55,179
trace you I a little bit of choco maybe

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,059
season my a-v examples and then that's

00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:59,980
about it so 2 32 6 30 it's in i believe

00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:02,920
track margarita which is that way

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,059
tomorrow afternoon and i look forward to

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:15,330
seeing if as many of you as possible

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:15,330
tomorrow thank you questions

00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,960
you

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,120
did you wire up your your church your

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,870
traits thing to an sqlalchemy object

00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,580
because it's already got the information

00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,320
about the types of everything and I

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,300
could pop a nice little box and save it

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:43,250
and send it to the database or is that

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:48,980
entirely different but I know because I

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:50,570
want to quite possibly yes but the one

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,170
thing I'd so I know essentially nothing

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,120
about sequel after me Justin well no I

00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:57,410
do know is that is that the traits uses

00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,210
some pretty crazy magic under the hood

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,980
so lots of meta classes and things and I

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,080
have a nasty feeling that sequel alchemy

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,100
does the same thing so you only have to

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,740
try come out how to keep those things

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,450
separate but yeah I don't see any reason

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:17,630
why couldn't be done huh sorry Diedrich

00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:21,680
do you have a comment there so flip

00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:23,210
float int as well as you have lists of

00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,890
Dixon thing that goes one other trade

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,550
side that starts to be quite a problem

00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:29,930
to map directly to to sequel alchemy

00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:33,380
mappers and so on but there is there is

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,880
an it's under svn somewhere there's no

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,050
fundamental reason you can do this but

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,270
there may be some technical issues along

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,180
the way it worked fine so it's using

00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:44,750
friction in one of our project and so

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:48,580
it's feasible but it's not yeah

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,580
advertised a lot midday

00:20:53,830 --> 00:21:09,279
their questions oh let's hang one sorry

00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:11,830
uh two questions actually one for us

00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,620
into the other did you happen to be at

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,700
the pipe I talk right before yours I'm

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,140
afraid I missed it because I was

00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:23,080
panicking Oh get risen and that I did

00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:25,360
and told look into pie pie that they do

00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,630
you have any official position so to

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,730
speak on it or something as far as I

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,299
know we haven't used it in any of our

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,289
projects I know that's something that

00:21:34,299 --> 00:21:38,049
people are very interested in is getting

00:21:35,289 --> 00:21:39,820
numpy fully working on pie pie and and I

00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:44,919
think and thought would be very

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:47,590
interested at two I know that I guess I

00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:49,960
don't know ready um I guess my personal

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:51,250
feeling is that pie pie is amazing thing

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,360
it's only just got there so the reason

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,210
we haven't been using it is just because

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,830
historically no apps it wasn't quite

00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:58,299
usable a year ago but within the last

00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,159
year it's reached a state where where

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:05,169
people are really using it I could see

00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:08,139
us using it yeah the question was

00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:12,010
because obviously in a computational

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:13,720
field there's lots of optimization to be

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,389
gained by using such a thing and the

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,590
conclusion of the was basically

00:22:15,389 --> 00:22:20,320
there are a number of sanctions that

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,539
already work numpy is not one of them

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,179
yes and what we need now to make it work

00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:28,600
is money so if you want pie by to work

00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:31,500
alumni please give us money just let you

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,500
know thank you

00:22:37,059 --> 00:22:41,879
