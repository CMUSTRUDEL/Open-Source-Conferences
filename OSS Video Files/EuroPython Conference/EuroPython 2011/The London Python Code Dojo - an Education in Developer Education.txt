thank you okay it can't start could you

00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:19,250
put your hand up if you've been two

00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:22,539
thousand and Python code dojo okay so if

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,500
you look around and into the audience um

00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:27,170
the other thing I'd like to say is that

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,760
I encourage people to shout out and well

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,369
not shout out but interrupt and ask

00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,649
questions while I'm going along

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,120
generally if something's confusing or it

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:36,949
doesn't make sense it is probably

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,470
because I'm not explained it properly so

00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:43,010
it's probably for it something very

00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:45,020
simple so just interrupt and tell me and

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,829
I'll try the best I can to to make

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,090
things sound simple hi so the London

00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,059
Python code odor is a community

00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,610
organized monthly meeting of Python

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,649
dudes basically and my aim in this

00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:00,559
presentation is to tell you what we get

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,030
up to ultimately so that the last

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,920
question I'm going to ask of you is

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:06,170
going to be are you going to go away and

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,829
organizer Python code dojo I hope to see

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,060
lots of hands raised so before I start I

00:01:09,829 --> 00:01:13,790
want to tell you a little bit about me

00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,350
just so that you could see where I'm

00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,140
coming from why I have the particular

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:20,750
context that I have particular interest

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,100
in the dojo so I trained as a musician

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,240
classically trained musician I've

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,619
trained at the Royal College of Music in

00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,380
London and I played professionally as

00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:29,240
well I did an academic news degree

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,860
rather than performance degree so I did

00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,689
lots of music theory composition

00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:35,600
analysis history of music things like

00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:37,460
that and I also met my lovely wife of

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
the Royal College of Music and not

00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:43,189
wanting to be to be a suffering for my

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,810
art I decided to become a teacher

00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:48,320
instead because I was a far more regular

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:51,290
salary so I became a music teacher and I

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,150
taught mainly rather tough teenagers in

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,750
inner-city schools in London and just

00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:59,210
outside London but i also had experience

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,100
teaching tiny tots from sort of five

00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,079
years old and i also did quite a number

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,299
of adult education classes in music

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:07,100
theory as well so I've done a lot of

00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:09,379
teaching basically my 20s was spent

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,450
teaching telling people about music and

00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,909
while I was doing that I did a degree an

00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:16,400
MA in philosophy of education because I

00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:19,520
was interested in the ideas behind

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,050
education and my dissertation was

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,750
account of the concept of creativity

00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,920
because there's a music teacher people

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:27,280
say you've got to learn to do music

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:30,320
because it helps you become creative and

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,970
they're one of many that there weren't

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,500
many people actually questioning well

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,980
what does creativity mean what is the

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:41,510
process things like that so there's a

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:44,180
bit of philosophy of education there I I

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,310
went on to do an an MSc in computing was

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,310
doing that I supported myself by writing

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,690
articles for computer shopper in the UK

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,420
so I wouldn't trust anything that those

00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:54,680
guys say in their reviews and I'm also

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,320
writing a book for a right at the moment

00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,480
so I eventually i tumbled into software

00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,820
development the first job I ever got was

00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,350
as a dotnet guy even though I'd been

00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,800
using open source technology all the way

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:09,140
up until then and since i only had met

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,660
as a professional kind of thing on my cv

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:15,290
i ended up doing quite a lot of net

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,670
about five or six years worth and in the

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,290
end i saved up enough money to be able

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,700
to take about three months off three to

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,160
six months off and i learnt python

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,420
instead and got a job and so on and so

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,250
forth so i've been using python for

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,500
about three years and i'm currently

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:29,570
working at fluid info which is the

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,450
unfunded world-changing startup as

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,340
Robert Scoble causes so today what are

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,830
we going to do well I put explain to you

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,170
what is a dojo I'm going to do that two

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,880
ways at the official version and then

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,090
what we actually get up to in the London

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,310
dojo I'm going to address why you might

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,220
want to attend a dojo because some

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,180
people can't see the point of it then

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,400
I'm going to ask some philosophical

00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:53,480
questions you know what is a good dojo

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,190
and I'm going to look at that from two

00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:59,420
points of view from that of the attendee

00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,790
and from that of the I hesitate to use

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:05,030
the word organizer because it's kind of

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:06,350
them well itself organizes but from the

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,630
guy standing at the front trying to get

00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:10,790
people to do things and then I'm going

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:13,490
to conclude with with some personal

00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:17,150
observations as well so without further

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:19,130
ado or what exactly is a dojo so as I'm

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,260
sure you know dojo is a term borrowed

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:23,300
from martial arts and basically it's a

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:25,100
place where you go to practice stuff I

00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,830
feel a little bit uncomfortable about

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,419
this name because you know people when

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,409
you say it's a dojo they think that's

00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:33,289
going to be fighting

00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:35,659
something like that and most certainly

00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:37,519
isn't anyway it was invented by some

00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:40,249
French dudes in Paris arm around

00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,949
december two thousand four and they have

00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:44,989
a very simple philosophy which you can

00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,050
read all about the coding dojo org

00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:49,189
website that they set up basically

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:51,709
acquiring coding skills should be a

00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:54,919
continuous process and I'd also add that

00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:57,169
improving existing skills is is also

00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:59,300
important and the assumption that

00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:01,249
they're making which I hope you will

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,199
agree with is that a good developer is

00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:04,999
always learning and re-evaluating in

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,969
order to improve their technique and

00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:10,189
obviously their value as well so in the

00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:12,229
end going to a CO dojo means

00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,059
deliberately practicing and that isn't

00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:19,219
me by the way although I am a tuba

00:05:14,059 --> 00:05:22,039
player so these are old ideas Socrates

00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:23,899
the father of Western philosophy said

00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,179
the unexamined life is not worth living

00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:28,039
I it's good to be in a continuous

00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:29,569
process of examination reexamination

00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,449
exist two in a half thousand years old

00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:34,249
and Heraclitus the grumpy old man of

00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:35,990
ancient Greek philosophy said much

00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:38,269
learning does not teach understanding in

00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:42,429
other words don't just read the book you

00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:45,349
know go and do something practical ok so

00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:48,649
the prison guys they came up with rather

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:54,409
a structured way of doing a dojo as you

00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:56,179
might expect being French so so I'll

00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,919
take you through it you can safely

00:05:56,179 --> 00:06:00,110
ignore the top three things which are

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:03,469
all kind of really bureaucratic the

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:06,079
interesting ones are the lower to blue

00:06:03,469 --> 00:06:08,449
and red portions where it says 40

00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:11,839
minutes code either prepared or randori

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:16,239
cata and that's where the action starts

00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:19,389
so a quatre what exactly is a quatre

00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:24,019
well a cata is again another term that

00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:25,909
the provision guys borrowed from from

00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:29,749
martial arts and it basically means

00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:32,929
forms and in the context of martial arts

00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:34,639
it's a sort of choreographed steps to be

00:06:32,929 --> 00:06:36,649
practiced again and again and again and

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,259
again so it improves your muscle memory

00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:40,459
so the theory is and I used to do a

00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:41,809
little bit of karate is that when

00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:42,720
someone tries to punch you in your face

00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:45,450
you

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,560
negatively do a block like that whatever

00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,510
you're supposed to do it's been years

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,480
since I did karate I'm not going to do

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,310
anymore another way of thinking about it

00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,720
we come from a musical background is

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,580
that it's a bit like the scales and

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,200
arpeggios and it to that musicians

00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,580
practice again and again and again and

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,260
again and the good thing about this sort

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,180
of process is that these can be graded

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,460
in difficulty and focus on particular

00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:09,390
different aspects of whatever it is that

00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:14,250
you're practicing and one thing while I

00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:16,890
was a music student that was banged into

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,440
me many a time was it's important to

00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:21,690
practice correctly um it's no point just

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,100
playing a piece of music or practicing a

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,780
catty you've got to sit back and think

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:29,490
well what did I achieve when I was doing

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,190
that okay um and in in the context of a

00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,860
code dojo are basically a quatre means a

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:38,880
self-contained programming puzzle quite

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:42,330
small and simple and in the London in

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,730
the part in the Paris kodocha they

00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,160
illustrate this with two mechanisms of

00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,840
doing a quatre so the first way that

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,350
they do a quatre is what's called the

00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:56,700
prepared quatre um this isn't a photo

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:58,560
from the code dojo by the way so I'll

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,090
just read out the slides you so the

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,760
presenter shows how to solve a

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,970
particular well-defined problem using

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,760
test-driven development and baby steps

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:12,479
and before the presenter can go on to

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:14,850
the next step that step must make sense

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,560
to everybody and it was be done in

00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,360
silence because you don't want to break

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,370
the concentration of the person who is

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,960
giving the presentation and the only

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,090
reason these are you are allowed to

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,910
interrupt is if you don't understand

00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,970
what's going on ok so it's bit like a

00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:32,339
formal lesson at school as somebody may

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,280
be doing chalk and talk type explanation

00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:38,280
at you the second type of quatre that

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,530
that the guys in Paris came up with it's

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:42,180
something called a randori cata and this

00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,030
is actually a photo from the dojo and

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:47,970
any more photos that you see will be

00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:51,150
taken from once I managed to snatch

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,060
whilst at the dojo so basically it works

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:56,220
like this it's um

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,570
it's an iterative public pair

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,839
programming using test-driven

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,550
development so each pair has a time slot

00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,100
and there's a pilot and the copilot and

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,540
the pilot basically describes what

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,970
what's going on nobody's allowed to

00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,040
interrupt only the copilot is allowed to

00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:17,430
ask questions or offer comments and

00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,980
things like that and at the end of their

00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:22,290
time slot or wherever we decide to do to

00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,300
sort of bound them into particular

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:27,449
coding session at the end of that time

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,459
the copilot becomes the new pilot the

00:09:27,449 --> 00:09:33,120
pilot goes back into the audience and

00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:37,889
there's a happy volunteer to join join

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,740
in and become the new co-pilot I'm okay

00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:43,319
that's void space Michael Ford and

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,500
there's John ribbons or Kate as he likes

00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:49,860
to be known and is the copilot and

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:52,889
that's Tim who's a Python core developer

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,410
as well there who's gonna who's got a

00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:56,790
rather sneaky smile on his face um the

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,329
important thing to also notice is that

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:02,490
you know when you oh well when I learn

00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:03,930
to drive I was asked to sort of give a

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,870
running commentary on what I was

00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:08,519
thinking about and probably for the for

00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,600
the nerves of my driving instructor so

00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,190
you know you're driving along and you

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,870
say okay I can see the junction coming

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,370
along so I'm gonna look in my mirror ok

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,690
I'm going to signal on going left i'm

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,250
going to apply the brakes and i'm going

00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,750
to just slow down a bit sooner because i

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,300
could see this somebody walk across the

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:22,980
road blah blah blah so you do that sort

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,230
of thing while you're coding along so I

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,579
can see I've got this problem I'm going

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,100
to first of all right unit test that

00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:30,630
just spent you know test this specific

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,699
thing I'm going to move over to the real

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,220
code just hack something that it works

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:37,350
ok I'm going to go back and blah blah ok

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,389
so you work like that so that's

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:43,670
basically how a dojo is supposed to work

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:49,319
as defined by the French dudes in Paris

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:51,509
so um what is a dojo in London um so

00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:54,420
I'll tell you a little bit about how how

00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:56,519
the dojo started um we have a meeting in

00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,550
London every self and called the Python

00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,500
piss up at py ssup which is a pub

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:04,380
meeting base of your social gathering

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:09,240
and I was chatting to Jonathan Hartley

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:12,030
about being a musician and how in music

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,990
you have master classes so you go up on

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:18,480
stage there is some maestro there and

00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:21,810
you play in front of your peers and then

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,420
the maestro takes you to pieces really

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,880
and it's it's part of being a music

00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:28,950
student and when I say takes you to

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,650
pieces I mean that in a positive way as

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,450
well although I have seen people reduced

00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,220
to tears but that's been more due to

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:37,530
their insecurity rather than the maestro

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,300
being a bit of an idiot and generally

00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,500
they're very good and so Jonathan

00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,150
responded by saying well have you heard

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,950
about a code that's a little bit like

00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,810
that you kind of get up and you code and

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:49,410
it's in public and people see what

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:54,990
you're doing and so we organized our

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:58,160
first meeting and we really did try hard

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,690
at the start to follow the prison rules

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,270
but like the slide says we didn't know

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,660
what we were doing and we did we stick

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,920
to the rules um the first mistake was

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,260
that we started the evening with pizza

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,910
and beer and this didn't really set the

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,140
scene for a calm and thoughtful coding

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:16,920
session which is kind of what we were

00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,690
hoping but it was quite good we had lots

00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,610
of geek socializing and people meeting

00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,090
old friends and we had the pizza in the

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,940
beer and we had about 25 people turn up

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:29,790
and we chose to do the randori quatre so

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,000
the pair programming ok and the rule

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:36,900
that we had was that you had ten minutes

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,150
or a passing unit test for each pair and

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,370
this worked quite well but like I said

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,860
we didn't know what we were doing and we

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,000
made several mistakes um the first of

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,700
which is that we only had two editors

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,180
available are the really friendly Emacs

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,040
and them and I think the first person up

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,620
though hadn't used either of them for

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,300
years so we spent a lot of time faffing

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,320
about with editors basically we didn't

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,140
have a standard keyboard we're using

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,590
this laptop which is a UK Mac which has

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:06,900
a double quote in the wrong place and at

00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:08,280
is in the wrong place as well so people

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,930
were typing furiously and it all just

00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:13,200
wouldn't work because everything was in

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:14,850
the wrong place um we chose to do a

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
twitter-based quatre because we thought

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:18,019
that was something people would find

00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,639
interesting but it was just too

00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,730
difficult to complicate it basically

00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:25,660
owned um it was hard to do it was hard

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:28,759
because we couldn't do an iterative

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,860
build up of tests working code test

00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:32,720
wouldn't go test working code in small

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,339
steps it seems to be a kind of an

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,549
all-or-nothing type thing so we had

00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:40,639
several groups which hit the ten-minute

00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:43,089
boundary and the next iteration had to

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,949
take over to try and pass that unit test

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:47,809
and that meant only six or seven people

00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:50,089
got a chance to actually do any coding

00:13:47,809 --> 00:13:53,119
as well but happily we got it to work

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:55,299
basically we were pulling down data from

00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:57,920
Twitter and we were trying to build a

00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:01,369
visualization of the person's followers

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,290
um other stuff that wasn't supposed to

00:14:01,369 --> 00:14:05,119
happen at the first meeting of the

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:06,649
London Python code Oh Joe was

00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:08,959
spontaneous applause for working code

00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:11,540
which was really quite cool lots of

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,399
audience participation like people just

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,019
interrupting and going no don't do it

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,720
like that what you want to do is do it

00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:19,129
like this in fact we had at one point we

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,049
had three really interesting

00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:23,119
conversations happening in the room and

00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:24,980
I had to just sort of stop someone over

00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:26,420
there and let's listen to what this guy

00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,009
has to say and then we'll come to you

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,639
and I was doing my kind of back to

00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:33,470
school teacher thing yeah so there was

00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:35,269
lots of discussion and debate and it was

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:37,509
generally a noisy time remember I said

00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:39,949
that in the Paris dojo they kind of

00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,689
emphasized you know quiet silent

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:44,569
thoughtful reflection and things like

00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:46,670
that and unfortunately it wasn't like

00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:50,240
that at all in the London dojo sorry

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,369
about that but in the plenary at the end

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,160
we thought that this was really really

00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:59,839
good stuff Gotye just put your hand up

00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,040
okay that is gorgeous fault um in the

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,629
discussion at the end we actually

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,429
thought that the interaction and the

00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:05,449
interruption and the shouting out and

00:15:04,429 --> 00:15:07,639
things like that wasn't actually a

00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:08,899
positive aspect of the meeting when I

00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,790
say people were shouting out and saying

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:12,740
no don't do it like that it wasn't in a

00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,819
nasty way it was done because they could

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,860
see that something there was some

00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,360
problem happening and we would stop when

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,209
we talk about it and that was really

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,639
quite um yeah who's quite good fun doing

00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:24,799
that and so we continue to do round

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,160
Laurie based cata for a few months on

00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,779
until Dave one of

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,089
members had a great idea i'm not sure

00:15:28,779 --> 00:15:34,149
whether you can see that but basically

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,949
he had a presentation that he wanted to

00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:38,980
give and he wanted to practice doing

00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:40,629
that and so he wanted to present it to

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:43,149
the dojo because we're a friendly group

00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:45,040
of people it's a kind of about python in

00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:47,050
development so we were kind of subject

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,180
experts as well and we're nice guys and

00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,279
we're going to give criticism everything

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:54,730
actually at the same meeting aunt karen

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,589
who's another attendee at the dojo it

00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,170
suggested that wouldn't be great if

00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:01,689
rather than and doing around Ori katha

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:04,779
we split up into small groups to solve

00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:05,949
the problem that we had in hand um he

00:16:04,779 --> 00:16:07,959
didn't actually like the fact that only

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:10,149
six or seven people got a chance to do

00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:12,189
any coding in the evening and he also

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,019
pointed out that some attendees didn't

00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:15,370
want to code in front of everyone but

00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:17,529
but we're happy to code in smaller

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,879
groups yeah um I on we better wait for

00:16:17,529 --> 00:16:23,230
EM the mic sorry I might have missed

00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,939
when you mentioned this so the point of

00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:31,750
this is in two hours or three hours to

00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:34,509
to solve a build one application among

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:36,189
the group yeah I like I'll explain

00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:38,290
exactly what happens in the group stuff

00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:40,480
um in a second but yeah we're all given

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:44,110
a that happens in the freezing dojo as

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,970
well no no not the group based stuff the

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,319
the only thing that's as far as I can

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,240
tell the only thing that happens in the

00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:54,670
prison dojo is either the the baby steps

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,860
presented katha or the Randall ricotta

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:59,110
her programming iteration do they solve

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,529
like project euler problems or what and

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:04,510
there would be things like um they're

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,339
just small self-contained problems that

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,630
you could solve in an hour and often

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,339
they would be used to illustrate a

00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:13,209
particular aspect of programming

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:16,059
something like that so I don't know Pig

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,289
Latin translate it for example just so

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:19,030
that you got used to doing string

00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:23,500
manipulation or something like that yeah

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:27,069
um but a good question okay so we had

00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:29,919
instantly and two new dodo formats okay

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,750
so the first format that we had upon

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,330
Dave suggestion was the show and tell

00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:35,679
dojo so Dave did his presentation and

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,230
some of the people stepped up because

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,730
they wanted to tell us about things and

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,559
this is Renee who's a PI game Cordova

00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:44,090
and he seems to plug everything but the

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,860
kitchen sink into his laptop and

00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,929
proceeded to tell us all about how you

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,440
could control this from pygame which is

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:54,260
really really cool it's more like a more

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,730
like a seminar than presentations so we

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,980
encourage people to interrupt to ask

00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:59,299
questions it's a debate to code along as

00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,220
well we've had several people towed

00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:03,799
along when and when a library has been

00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,919
presented to point out problems and

00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:09,530
generally not to just sit there in other

00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:10,700
words participation is expected what's

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,780
happening at the moment is you're all

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,450
kind of just sitting there apart from

00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:16,429
one guy and you're listening to me and

00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,809
nobody's actually come back to me in the

00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,250
dojo there would be people with their

00:18:17,809 --> 00:18:21,320
laptops out follow along on earth

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:22,970
following along as I'm code along trying

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,620
to present something they might be

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,280
asking questions pointing things out etc

00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:30,200
etc um so the second type of dojo that

00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,590
we came up with which was Karen's idea

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:41,120
was the team dojo yes Christian that's

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:42,770
you now in the UK we had we had a really

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,360
cool program called the great egg race

00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:48,770
where teams from science departments in

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,809
universities in the UK but were given an

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,500
egg and they had to get it from A to B

00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:55,850
but they were given a particular problem

00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
that got in their way like they had to

00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:59,299
fire over a canyon or there was a

00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,790
stretch of water or they had to put it

00:18:59,299 --> 00:19:03,440
on a self motorized car or something

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:06,890
like that ok so it's a kind of a

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,720
scientific problem and you all know what

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,820
scrap heap challenges all of junkyard

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,340
wars or whatever it is in the state yeah

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:15,200
it's it's kind of like that so basically

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,850
you're given a problem and you have to

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:22,250
solve it in a set period of time as a

00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:24,530
team and what we do there we go join the

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:27,049
pizza in the beer part of the evening

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,220
when we're doing our group dojo people

00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:30,700
go up to the blackboard or whiteboard

00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:34,280
and they write down a whole list of

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,380
problems that seem interesting and then

00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:39,020
before we start the coding session we

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,460
take a vote so this is really low

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,730
maintenance dojo in terms of

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,710
organization we take a vote and then we

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:50,480
split into teams of about five or six

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:52,990
and all attempt to solve the problem at

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,990
the same time

00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,420
and this takes about one and a half

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:02,870
hours and it generally gets very very

00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:04,790
noisy and I'm usually shouting out that

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:09,730
sort of half-hour intervals how long

00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:12,740
you've got left and at the end we have a

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:15,340
show tell and review session which for

00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,050
me is is my favorite part of the evening

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,480
because everybody's heads in the same

00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:23,330
problem space and there are five

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,830
different teams about to show you how

00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,080
they've solved a problem that you've

00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:28,820
been trying to attempt and often they

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,800
will have gone off and all sorts of

00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,650
extraordinary tangents that you couldn't

00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,930
have possibly imagined or they've done

00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,610
they've used the same sort of strategy

00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,260
as you but they've done it differently

00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:40,790
or they've used a particular Python

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,740
library that you weren't aware of and

00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,450
things like that and the other good

00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,160
thing about doing the show and tell is

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,430
that it's important to be able to

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,230
justify your design decisions and

00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,780
explain your code as well I'm so

00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,600
presenting your code and having a live

00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:59,780
code review basically is a really good

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:05,240
thing to have done and it's usually very

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:08,480
very funny as well so why would you want

00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,040
to participate in in a code dojo how

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,410
does attending a dojo relate to our

00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,360
assumption that a good developer is

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:16,460
always trying to develop themselves and

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,880
learn and re-evaluating everything well

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:23,870
um I hope the educational benefits um of

00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,570
taking partner dojo are obvious I'll go

00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,890
through these so obviously you learn by

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,780
practicing by doing something rather

00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,590
than just sitting there like you lar and

00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:38,230
learning about a dojo fell safely with

00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:41,030
sympathy ok so this sort of addresses

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,770
the comment that the guy in the keynote

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,720
last night was saying about how failure

00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:47,210
is essential if you want to learn in the

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,530
dojo it's ok to fail in fact that's

00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,240
usually how I start it and you're

00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:52,070
welcome to the London code dojo it's a

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,560
safe place to really up because

00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,170
really you don't want to up at work

00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:00,200
and you can experiment and a mess around

00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:02,300
and in the show and tell you can tell us

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,560
how you cocked up spectacularly and

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,559
we'll all have learned something from

00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,809
that

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,129
another important aspect of the dojo is

00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:10,350
you're working in groups and we have

00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:15,120
lots of different levels of Python

00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:16,559
Easter's in in the group and so not only

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,149
is it important for the newbies to sort

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,889
of learn about Python but it's important

00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:21,240
for those advanced Python programmers to

00:22:19,889 --> 00:22:23,940
be able to explain what they're doing

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,009
back to newbies that in itself takes

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,419
quite a bit of thought because although

00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:29,610
you might understand it you've got to

00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,679
try and simplify this concept or this

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,210
library or whatever it is this piece of

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,759
code does you've got to simplify this

00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,159
and explain to this this newbie Python

00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,749
program which which shows quite a lot of

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,059
level of skill so being able to practice

00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:43,919
teaching is a really good skill really

00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,080
good opportunity and explaining yourself

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,799
to peers just define your design

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,960
decisions like I said in the in the show

00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,210
and tell it is is obviously very

00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,559
important thing to be able to do

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,509
exploring each other solutions again in

00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,369
the show and tell like I said the

00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:01,710
advantages is by the end of the group

00:22:59,369 --> 00:23:03,480
dojo everybody's minds in the same place

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:05,190
and there have been several occasions

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,259
when I thought well how the hell are

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,369
they going to fix that problem and then

00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:10,769
they've come up with something really

00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:13,559
elegant or it sucks just as much as my

00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:16,440
solution did or my group solution and

00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:18,269
perhaps you know one of the most

00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,100
important aspect of the dojo is that

00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:25,289
we're building we're building a

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:26,850
community yeah sorry hey I wanted to ask

00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:28,769
was I'm really really curious of doing

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:32,730
something like this I currently live in

00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:35,009
Plymouth yeah the southwest and I still

00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:38,309
haven't found people which would like to

00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:41,460
do it but if I do yeah what does it take

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:44,190
to to build one and what do I need to

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,419
look for okay I'll come to pack thank

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:50,700
you yeah don't worry um so um so like

00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,490
good open source developers we we took

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,279
something on the Python at the the code

00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:59,159
dojo rules from Paris and we forked the

00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:03,869
concept and we adapted it to our own

00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:07,559
group dynamics okay um so as I was

00:24:03,869 --> 00:24:11,000
saying community the pizza and beer part

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,520
of the the evening is important part of

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,850
of community building for a start people

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,470
kind of relax over a pizza and a beer

00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:20,480
and people get to share war stories

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:21,770
about what they've been up to etc etc

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,790
it's a good way to catch up with people

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:28,490
as well and the other thing I'd like to

00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:33,320
say is that attendees like I said

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:35,600
abilities differ vastly we've had we had

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,270
a ruby guy from Brazil just turn up on

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,530
spec and he just wanted to try out

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,120
pythons he didn't know anything about

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,610
Python when he was a program we've had

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,170
PHP guys we've had people who weren't

00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,940
programmers but they heard that Python

00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,910
was a good way to start right the way

00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,530
through to people who published authors

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:53,930
using Python and things in the social

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,550
social part of the evening everybody's

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,380
kind of level because you're just sort

00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,810
of eating pizza and sharing a beer

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:01,340
together um so it's it's a really good

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:03,440
way to start the evening everybody gets

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:08,090
relaxed and so on and you get to know

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:10,370
your peers um so a couple of

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:12,950
philosophical questions Oh what is a

00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,520
good dojo um well I was thinking about

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:18,020
this on the plane over here and as far

00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,650
as I can tell from the attendees

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:24,770
perspective um it's fun to solve

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,350
problems in a place where it is safe to

00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,780
make mistakes and you're encouraged to

00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:34,610
show and tell what you're up to so I'll

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:38,450
just back that up come on ok ok it's fun

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:39,680
there are you know studies thousands

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,210
upon thousands more maybe not thousands

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,980
upon thousands that say you know you're

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,090
more conducive to learning new stuff if

00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,900
you're actually enjoying what you're

00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:49,730
doing um people's experience at school

00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,680
probably backs that up it's kind of

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,500
common sense so what we try and do is

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:57,290
have fun at the dojo so it's fun to

00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,600
solve problems awesome attendees get to

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:03,230
go on a mad evil scientist trip while

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,910
they're doing the dojo in a place where

00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,880
it's safe to make mistakes celebrate

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,350
failure you might think well why would

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,450
you want to celebrate failure why would

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,950
you want to try and make mistakes well

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:14,630
what do you think musicians do in a

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,970
rehearsal that's the whole point you

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,590
making a mistake in the rehearsal so

00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:20,090
when you really need to do whatever it

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:21,530
is solve this problem when you're doing

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,720
some code you can think back you know

00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:24,500
what that was this guy he tried it that

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,630
way in the dough

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,820
and it didn't work okay so it's a safe

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,480
place to make mistakes as Jonathan's

00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:34,940
obviously doing that and it's great to

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,070
get feedback and analyze in a praise

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:40,910
report and obviously Ravan here is is

00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,400
showing is teaching which is a really

00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:45,980
great thing and um so what is a good

00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,540
dojo from an organizers perspective so

00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,430
I'm the guy that stands at the front um

00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,470
to introduce the evening there's a

00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:54,080
result i'm often misidentified as the

00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:56,810
organizer actually the group sort of

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,550
organizes itself but as you know i have

00:26:56,810 --> 00:27:02,210
a background in education and music and

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:04,340
things and so i'm interested in trying

00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,070
to work out what is it that makes the

00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:09,860
dojo work from the person who's trying

00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,030
to tell people what to do and so i'm

00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,550
reminded of something that a former

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:16,580
professor of mine um said to us in a

00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:20,810
lecture and I'm paraphrasing this so

00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:24,860
this is Keith's wanek who's very well

00:27:20,810 --> 00:27:26,450
known in music education circles um so

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,710
the effect of any educational activity

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,760
should be to bring about a positive

00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:34,460
change in learners well no Sherlock

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,530
you know obviously you know an

00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,960
educational experience is to sort of

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,330
bring around a positive change in

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,370
learners I'm surely all learning

00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:45,050
situations are positive and therefore

00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:46,760
they'll be learnt that they'll be fun

00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:48,410
and interesting and life-changing and

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,420
things and every teacher wants to be

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,830
like Robin Williams out of dead poet

00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,300
society and you're all going to stand on

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,800
your chairs at the end and quote Walt

00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,870
Whitman at me and things like that but

00:27:54,800 --> 00:28:01,160
you know what it doesn't really work

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:04,580
like that sometimes that was staged by

00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,110
the way often when you're in a talk and

00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,850
this might have happened here at you're

00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:10,640
a Python I know it's happened to me

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,650
regularly throughout my learning career

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,540
you can be bored and noreen frustrated

00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:16,190
distracted the person who's trying to do

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:17,840
the teaching or the explaining might not

00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:21,290
know what's going on or what they're

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,450
doing and in fact you know although it's

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,220
obvious that you might want to be aiming

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:27,770
for a positive experience it certainly

00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,420
isn't University practiced for lots of

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:33,170
various reasons either out of in

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:36,380
competence or or well or just because

00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:38,210
the person is not a very nice teacher

00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,750
and we all know at least one of those

00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:45,050
from a high street so how can you tell

00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:46,880
it's going well in a dojo well um if it

00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:51,110
looks like that you know you've got

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,420
problems ok so how can you tell it's

00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:55,880
going right well for me it's the

00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,050
essences is this there's some sort of

00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,210
positive aim and something is happening

00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:04,580
to achieve the same and it's possible to

00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:07,040
measure that this aim is being met ie

00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,300
there some sort of feedback ok and this

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,070
could be generalized to any sort of

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:14,240
learning situation and if I were to

00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:17,480
change that and explain that in the

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,060
sense of the group based dojo that the

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,530
aim is that we've decided on a problem

00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,630
we've all agreed on the name and

00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:26,000
something is happening to fulfill that

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,560
aim so we work collaboratively in groups

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,150
to solve the problem and there's some

00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,350
sort of feedback not only within the

00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,760
group's while you're doing the practical

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:33,380
activity but at the end when you do the

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,150
show and tell and people are giving you

00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,830
critique and suggestions and you can get

00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:41,960
some sort of idea as to how well you've

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:43,700
done ok so I've been talking for about

00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,440
half an hour and I'm coming to the end

00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:52,280
so I'll end with some conclusions and

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,840
personal observations um so I'll assume

00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,090
everybody here wants to be a better a

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,810
better developer and one way to do this

00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:06,230
is to attend a dojo but this is only one

00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:08,930
way of improving yourself and people who

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:12,530
want to learn and improve themselves are

00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,910
often looking for teachers I really like

00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,460
the definition of the expert from

00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:21,260
yesterday's keynote um the same could be

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:23,390
applied to teacher as well and I'd like

00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,760
to say beware of people who offer

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:28,610
themselves as gurus or who promote some

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,160
sort of a system or who offer pithy

00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:35,360
aphorisms that sound really cool and you

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:38,540
think ah yes I'll practice that we have

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,770
500 years of music education history to

00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,380
draw upon when you're training a

00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,200
musician and music education is full of

00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,660
systems and pithy aphorisms and great

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,050
teachers and not so great teachers

00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,750
just to go through some of them so i'm

00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:58,520
going to move away from the microphone

00:30:52,750 --> 00:31:01,280
and i'll just talk really loud so oh is

00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:06,260
this working yes it is dark rosary the

00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:08,330
mix is a movement to music gratis add

00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,190
plan a sum is a way of learning how to

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,200
write counterpoint which is how you put

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:14,780
two very different melodies together and

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:18,470
they get to sound really cool okay that

00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:19,880
was invented 300 years ago and I was

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:21,980
taught how to do that when i was at

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,370
music concert with us so it's still a

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:28,340
methodology that's used today modus

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:30,170
novus is something that they inflict on

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:32,660
why they inflicted it on me its ear

00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:35,570
training a tonal ear training which

00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:38,540
means that it's not in a key like Doremi

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:42,830
Faso partido um it's it's a tonal it's

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:45,940
it's it's horrible really the code I

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:48,850
method code I was an interesting guy and

00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:51,230
he focused on working with little kids

00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,390
well all sorts of musicians but

00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:56,120
especially little kids and he got them

00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:59,720
to learn hand science I can't remember

00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:02,330
them now but a hand signed for each for

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,890
each note in a scale and so as they were

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:05,600
singing along they would make the right

00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:09,230
hand sign for the note that they were

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,940
seeing at that time and that well that

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:14,630
helped them become very good singers for

00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:16,220
a start so that's the code I method Paul

00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:19,160
Hindemith was quite a famous composer

00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,740
again they inflicted that on me as oral

00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,140
training that's not so much a tonal as

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,640
tonal ear training so they would play a

00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:27,680
melody in fact they would play a

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,510
four-part melody a string quartet or

00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,580
something and they'd play it four times

00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:33,080
and expect me to have written it out no

00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,570
perfect by the end of it things like

00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,550
that and the whole point of this book is

00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,400
that you start simply and you get better

00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,930
and better Suzuki method who's heard of

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,930
Suzuki method cause it's quite famous

00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:48,020
okay Suzuki method is for learning extry

00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:51,560
instruments mainly and it's basically

00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:55,340
show and copy show and copy show and

00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:59,290
copy and they also get the parent of the

00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,290
child to learn along as well

00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:08,180
but the problem with that with showing

00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,500
copy showing copies that you'll get a

00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,540
student who might be able to play the

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,110
Mendelssohn Violin Concerto but not much

00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:17,180
else really so um this is the problem

00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:19,370
with having particular systems that you

00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:22,580
might follow people get kind of rather

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:24,710
obsessed with them um well the Suzuki

00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,330
method it doesn't work for everyone and

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:29,420
that's the same for any method so I

00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:32,480
would advise Oh encourage people if you

00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:35,330
can safely ignore a system um you know

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,620
if something else works for you and in

00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:38,180
the very worst cases they can do a lot

00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,130
of damage and I produce students that

00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,840
I've met that could play some fantastic

00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:42,800
pieces of music in the audition but when

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,720
you actually sit them in an orchestra

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,090
that just stuck there like puddings not

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,690
being able to do anything which is not

00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,880
very nice for them as well as for you

00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:55,340
also it's it's tempting to be impressed

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,100
and following listen to people who offer

00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:01,280
systems and methodologies and speak in

00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,560
mysterious ways and I'd encourage you to

00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,800
be cynical with these sorts of people

00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,330
and ask questions of them just like we

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,830
do in the dojo we ask questions of each

00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,510
other you know why are you writing it

00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:13,010
like that you know why did you make that

00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:16,280
piece of code working the way I did

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:20,090
there so basically learn to practice

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:25,520
learning really and yeah that's a pity

00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:28,130
have arisen so I'll wrap up and say I'm

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,450
kind of with Socrates um don't just

00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:32,630
blindly follow what other people say oh

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:34,850
do make up your own mind cultivate

00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,900
autonomy Autonomy's rather an important

00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:38,570
concept in philosophy of education

00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:42,140
because that's basically what the

00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:43,370
teacher is aiming for is for autonomous

00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:46,490
students they're trying to do themselves

00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:48,400
out of the job basically um if you're in

00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,960
London come along and say hi i

00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:54,020
advertised on the python UK mailing list

00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,070
um is that another one of yours go to

00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,110
you no it's not okay binary beer bottles

00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:03,950
it's that installation so I have a

00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:05,090
question for you guys after you've seen

00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:06,980
this talk how many of you are going to

00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,610
go home and organize something like a

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,610
code Durga

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:19,690
you'll try it good you need to find

00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:21,549
people which are motivated that's the

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:24,880
only problem yeah absolutely because if

00:35:21,549 --> 00:35:27,369
not it just failed epically well yeah it

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,140
depends I mean in London we've got quite

00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:32,680
a large Python community anyway and

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,589
we've got about 15 or 16 core attendees

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:37,539
at the dojo and we are dojos are only

00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:40,720
about 30 I encourage you to come to

00:35:37,539 --> 00:35:45,190
Plymouth yeah I can imagine the thing

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,170
what you might like to do then is um is

00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,640
trying to coordinate with another group

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:50,769
maybe a whole bunch of Ruby developers

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,990
and solve the same problem in Ruby which

00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:54,970
is kind of as readable as what almost is

00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:57,009
readable as Python and you can do sort

00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,509
of compare and contrast with them as

00:35:57,009 --> 00:36:01,390
well so you don't have to just try and

00:35:58,509 --> 00:36:04,269
target one particular I'm not targeting

00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:06,609
any particular language I'm saying for

00:36:04,269 --> 00:36:08,559
me it'd be okay you know it's not not

00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:10,450
language oriented it the whole concept

00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,559
of this dojo is really really

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:15,730
interesting problem is that in any case

00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:17,920
you should come to Plymouth and see it

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:21,640
yourself yeah yeah I quite understand

00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,200
yeah absolutely um is it clear what you

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,259
might what you do in a dojo if i

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:31,299
explaining this properly yeah okay cool

00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:35,230
any more questions we eat okay this is

00:36:31,299 --> 00:36:37,509
it we eat pizza we drink beer we decide

00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:39,009
a problem we solve it in groups and we

00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:40,569
give us hows about hour and a half and

00:36:39,009 --> 00:36:42,460
at the end we tell each other what we've

00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:47,230
been up to and that's it that's five

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:49,239
steps it's not rocket science okay

00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,739
fantastic yeah I was going to say if you

00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:53,559
in Italy then yeah sort of more or less

00:36:50,739 --> 00:36:57,130
there bruna yeah in London you have

00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:59,079
quite a big a big Python community what

00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:03,249
if you don't have any local community

00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:05,410
will you start a dojo and try to build a

00:37:03,249 --> 00:37:06,640
community around it or start doing

00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,880
something else and then use that

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,680
community and Duff I suppose that

00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,160
depends on the situation you find

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,049
yourself in really for example you know

00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,789
Bruno used to live quite close by to me

00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:21,190
a melon Keynes we could have started at

00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:23,640
Python dojo where we were because I can

00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:25,590
see at least two people who

00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,450
within 10 miles all have lived within 10

00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:29,280
miles of where I live and there's also

00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,110
Michael and other people around so we

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,900
could have about six to seven people and

00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:35,700
we could do a randori based dojo rather

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,680
than a group-based dojo but if you're

00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,020
stuck out in the sticks like poor guy on

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,630
the front row in Plymouth then it might

00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:47,970
be better to figure out where's the

00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:49,610
closest big city in aim for that so you

00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:53,370
know Southampton or something like that

00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:55,350
I suppose it depends on on your context

00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:59,250
really um there was a question at the

00:37:55,350 --> 00:38:04,230
back hi this is not the question in

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:09,630
Italy we did dojo I think four years ago

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:13,260
yeah from burnout from Paris and I met

00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:17,520
burnout in Munich yeah and we did it

00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:22,500
dojo in Milan for three years and we

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:26,400
used dojo to learn languages the last

00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:31,380
Doge I did I show python3 than the

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:35,600
receiver there was Ruby nest people that

00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:39,530
use a ruby and was very interesting to

00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:42,780
to compared to the two solutions and

00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:45,600
there was even Java people and so on I

00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:50,010
don't think it's possible to start a

00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:55,560
community with dojo causes at least in

00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:59,240
Italy is a little bit noisy and that you

00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:05,220
have to know the people if you want to

00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:07,440
fail safely yeah so you know obviously

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,270
not too much but not even like no one

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,359
speak at all and just people

00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:14,950
concentrated its to take the fun away

00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,839
it's a it's up to the person who is

00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:19,660
organizing always being kind of at the

00:39:16,839 --> 00:39:23,559
MC to to make sure that it doesn't get

00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:28,589
out of hand yeah you have to gather to

00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:31,690
trust the people i have with the weather

00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:33,819
where if you're coding with someone you

00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:37,559
don't trust that you can't fail it

00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:41,650
safely you can you cannot show your

00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:47,849
you're very very deep you know aching

00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:53,279
side any more questions Jonathan oh

00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:56,739
sorry I'm just one thing with organizing

00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:58,420
media groups and stuff I i recently went

00:39:56,739 --> 00:40:00,789
from just organizing on a mailing list

00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:03,099
to use me using meetup com this is for a

00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:05,019
group in Australia and they're just the

00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,729
the number of people that turned up

00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:09,039
because we're using a central organizing

00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:11,229
website as opposed to just a a mailing

00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,460
list was when we doubled the size when

00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:14,710
we did that so if you're trying to

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,779
organize a group really recommend having

00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:18,099
some kind of website support Oh meetup

00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:20,440
comms quite good and there are others

00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:24,130
yes absolutely we I announce it on the

00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:26,499
UK mailing list but we use um not meet

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,210
up one of the other ones and people

00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:29,769
booked tickets so we set a limit of 30

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:32,859
people otherwise it just gets out of

00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:34,420
hand and we when I announce it the

00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:38,460
tickets are sold out within about six

00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:42,609
hours so it's very popular Jonathan yeah

00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:44,920
version-control there's two things the

00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:47,589
first is that when you're coding you got

00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,210
version control anything oh well I could

00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:51,190
have to do it right now because I can

00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:53,319
change it later which is true but you'd

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:55,809
rather do it right now and I think

00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:59,259
that's part of the concentrated formal

00:40:55,809 --> 00:41:03,279
thing yeah but the other thing is I've

00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:06,460
got into the habit now of making commit

00:41:03,279 --> 00:41:08,650
whenever I can so sort of every 15

00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,710
minutes or so make a commit with the one

00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:13,960
line one line message if I can do it

00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:18,339
that way I like to do it that way now

00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:21,869
what my sort of question or sort of you

00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:24,420
you're doing stuff in the dojo and a

00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:26,640
version control record of the fire

00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,790
might be quite useful and interesting

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,950
and be anonymous you know yeah

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:34,500
absolutely so when we do the randori

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:37,140
counter at the end of each 10 minutes

00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:39,600
lot or passing unit test dr. commit and

00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,770
it'll be the two people who made who you

00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,540
know who was the pilot who was the

00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:46,040
copilot and some comment about yeah

00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:51,180
whatever it was they were doing we did

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:54,090
last year we did a dojo project that was

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,800
based over several dojos so we try to

00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:59,280
write an old-school adventure game

00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:03,270
text-based adventure game and each month

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:07,680
we would we would choose a problem from

00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:09,480
the domain try and solve it and at the

00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,330
end of the show and tell we would bless

00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,840
one solution and that would go into

00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:19,410
github or wherever as in form the basis

00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:21,090
of the next iteration so for example the

00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,190
first Steve the first evening we did

00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:26,370
that we are the problem was represent

00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,830
the game world and what a good example

00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:30,270
for lots of reasons so most of the

00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,310
group's I think four out of five groups

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:34,200
had a directed graph really where there

00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:38,810
was a node for each room and the edges

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:41,010
were the routes between all the rooms

00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:43,290
and that was a lot of fun but one group

00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:46,650
they did some sort of weird grid based

00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:49,610
system that that organically grew out of

00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:53,280
nothing and they failed spectacularly

00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:55,410
but it was really interesting to see why

00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,570
they did that and explain themselves you

00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:58,950
know we got so far you know we're half

00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,450
an hour into this we committed ourselves

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:02,550
to this way of doing and then we

00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:06,140
realized we'd made a big mistake here

00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:09,960
and this is why we made this big mistake

00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,440
so um yeah so we use version control in

00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:16,320
that instance when we're doing single

00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:19,410
problems in an evening people kind of

00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:24,030
get brownie points if they have unit

00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:25,680
tests and if they have a version control

00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:27,330
I suppose although I've never actually

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,740
seen version control when we've been

00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:30,740
doing group

00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:39,670
group-based DOJ's um so yeah Lawrence

00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,410
that comment about virgin control made

00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,210
me think about something we did we

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,940
didn't do cojo Jewess but this was a

00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:47,680
work where we like would get new people

00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,690
or people who try and trying to

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,770
basically increase the bus number so

00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:52,660
that there was some piece of code that

00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:54,310
like one or two people understood and

00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,710
more people needed to understand it so

00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:59,230
we would have two people up front

00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,790
hacking on something yeah and but since

00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:03,070
other we wanted other people to hack on

00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:05,080
it as well and we the problem we the

00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:08,260
reason that we needed to do something

00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:11,080
was that we had two people that were

00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,770
Emacs users and then we had a bunch of

00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:16,900
heretics and we needed some way of

00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:19,240
having the of getting this to work yeah

00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,320
so what we did now the the the good

00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,060
thing that we had was of course that we

00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,710
controlled all the machines so what we

00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:26,320
did was we put no machine on them we

00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:28,690
just had a dedicated box that so we you

00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,450
could literally just use show your own

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:33,280
desktop and the reason that source

00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:34,330
control checks works with that is of

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,310
course because you need source control

00:44:34,330 --> 00:44:38,380
to keep the source synchronized between

00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,930
different people I don't know if that

00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:44,080
might be too much tech for dojo yeah

00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:47,800
it's seriously the we try and be as

00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:50,800
lightweight as possible because as we

00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:53,760
found out in the first dojo um you know

00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:55,750
if people aren't using your your

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,600
development environment is a kind of a

00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:01,150
very personal space and if you're given

00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,160
some geezers macbook with them on it and

00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,710
you're an emacs user who uses a blunt

00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,090
ooh then you're you know you're screwed

00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:08,590
basically and you're you're spending

00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:10,690
half your time trying to figure out what

00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:12,610
the hell's happening but I think you've

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:19,780
made an excellent point and it addresses

00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:22,770
the guy from Plymouth thank you you do

00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:26,020
it at work and organizing a dojo at work

00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:28,180
it's a great way to increase the bus

00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,920
number as you say and if you were to do

00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,140
something like a randori casa where you

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,860
had more experienced coders who were

00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:38,290
always um paired with less experienced

00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:39,780
coders or new new new hires or something

00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,220
like that it's a great way of spreading

00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:44,290
information and also for the new hires

00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:46,180
in a safe environment to go

00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:48,430
I'm sorry I haven't got a clue what

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,620
about or why this is working and what

00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:52,000
this is doing because it's forcing the

00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:54,340
people who were there all ready to go

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,080
over their decisions and say look we

00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:59,020
built it this way because of this that

00:45:56,080 --> 00:46:02,130
and the other reasons and it's it's yeah

00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,940
so we had a little more strict

00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:06,280
teacher-student model mostly because

00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:10,390
like we had seriously arcane pieces of

00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,920
Fortran yeah and so it was a bit more of

00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,510
a teacher-student models we didn't we

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,740
didn't really do the rotation but I

00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:16,300
figure you know if you do it with like

00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,910
with let you said with Python and you

00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:20,440
solve problems that no one is that you

00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,450
don't have where one person in the room

00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,580
is like ridiculously more advanced than

00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:26,380
everyone else then you know so they

00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:28,870
could be the co-pilot and you and you

00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:29,980
rotate on the on the pilot for example

00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,630
so there's always somebody looking over

00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:34,770
your shoulder who knows this piece of

00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:38,760
code and you can ask daft questions to

00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:40,690
talking of questions any more questions

00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:47,050
no no I don't think there's one over

00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:50,290
there so where do you do these in a bar

00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:55,150
in your house okay so I better mention

00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:58,480
and that um so I used to do contracting

00:46:55,150 --> 00:47:00,700
for a company called fry IT I'm quartier

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,480
works there and Bruno who set the other

00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:07,510
side of you was an intern and so I

00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,360
proposed this idea and they support the

00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:12,970
community by letting us use their office

00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,420
for free they part they pay for the

00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,860
pizza and the beer and another way that

00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:20,200
we're helped out is that O'Reilly in

00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:22,660
fact is Josette downstairs every month

00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:25,840
she sends me a python book and if you

00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:31,150
look at some of the pictures of guys in

00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:33,430
the dojo you'll notice that they're all

00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:34,870
wearing name tags okay that's kind of

00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:35,830
important because if you're new there

00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:37,210
you need to be able to know with the

00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:39,250
people's names and people you say who

00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:41,140
you are as well but also at the end

00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:43,570
everybody takes their name tag off we

00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:45,190
put it in a box choose someone at random

00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:47,650
and they walk away with a free python

00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:50,680
book from O'Reilly which is kind of nice

00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:52,849
as well but it's organized in some some

00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:55,869
small companies office

00:47:52,849 --> 00:48:01,789
have you ever been to a Parisian dojo no

00:47:55,869 --> 00:48:03,739
no this is all we looked into like I

00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:05,779
said we looked into what the prison dojo

00:48:03,739 --> 00:48:07,640
rules were myself and Jonathan and some

00:48:05,779 --> 00:48:09,200
of the other guys and we thought okay

00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,690
we're going to do it like this this is

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,319
really quite good its formal its

00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:17,960
structured what could go wrong and as

00:48:15,319 --> 00:48:21,109
you know it'll went actually horribly

00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:24,229
right you know and like I say we we took

00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:26,799
the concept and we forked it and we we

00:48:24,229 --> 00:48:30,109
adapted we I want something it up

00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:32,299
we formed with it yes we we adapted it

00:48:30,109 --> 00:48:34,999
to our tomorrow in particular groups

00:48:32,299 --> 00:48:37,309
needs so then perhaps the best take away

00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:38,569
that you can have from this talk is well

00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:40,970
you've heard what we do you've heard

00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:43,670
what the guys in Paris do now try and

00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:45,710
you know work with that and use that as

00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,809
the basis of something that you might

00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:50,029
want to do as well and it'll be

00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:52,670
different for you as well i'm assuming

00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:54,950
mind you our Python developers the same

00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:57,759
everywhere in the world if that's the

00:48:54,950 --> 00:49:06,339
case then you know you're onto a winner

00:48:57,759 --> 00:49:06,339
