and do thank you and welcome everyone

00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:20,600
and thanks for so numerous participation

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,590
is this working okay thanks I I would

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,340
want to also think the pike on Italy for

00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:35,359
the best european conference ever that

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:37,639
it's my first one and today i would like

00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:46,639
to say something about building complex

00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:48,819
web applications having fun so i'm

00:00:46,639 --> 00:00:52,429
andrew and i'm a software integrator

00:00:48,819 --> 00:00:56,389
right now working in Italy but i'm

00:00:52,429 --> 00:01:00,229
originally from Poland I have eight

00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:03,079
years Piton experience and right now I'm

00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:07,280
mainly working with blown and recently

00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:10,340
with by ramit with pyramid and i'm also

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,229
an open source contributor which i will

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,229
tell more at the end of the presentation

00:01:16,929 --> 00:01:24,829
since three years i'm working with the

00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:28,810
red turtle team the red turtle is a

00:01:24,829 --> 00:01:32,749
python-based and custom oriented company

00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:36,950
it was founded 12 years ago in Ferrara

00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:41,119
and the majority of the customers right

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:44,329
now are from the public sector but this

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,619
probably could change in the future so

00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:52,990
this is just a very brief description

00:01:47,619 --> 00:02:01,009
who am i and where I'm working and now

00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:04,100
why I'm here so I strongly believe that

00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:09,590
the simple file is an important factor

00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:11,930
during software development in the last

00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:14,269
few years we have finished several

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:15,350
complex projects and some of them were

00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:19,250
successful some of

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,780
we're not so successful and based on

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:23,480
this experience I would like to share

00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:27,020
some thoughts I will not be talking

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,080
about certain methodology or a very

00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:33,500
concrete approach you should use but I

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,880
would like to say about the very basic

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,640
architectural principles i would like to

00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,810
also promote blown because it's a very

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:49,160
good CMS and also to promote pyramid

00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:54,740
which was not built by aliens so let's

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:56,750
start with clone and it is among the top

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:03,080
two percent of all open source projects

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:06,170
according to offer it has a nice number

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:09,710
I mean quite large not and large active

00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:13,460
core developers community this developed

00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:17,330
since 2001 and recently the light is for

00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:20,510
that one version was released it is

00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:28,670
focused mainly or not mainly but it is

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:33,020
focused on multi-language there are more

00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,820
than 40 languages available and it has

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:40,760
the best security track record of any

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:41,780
major CMS's you can check online and you

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,860
can see the numbers if you are

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:48,080
interesting i can tell you later those

00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:52,310
are one of the major plum deployments as

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:59,600
you can see quite big institutions and

00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:01,520
companies are using it but clone is not

00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,800
only about technology is also a little

00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:12,380
bit about the community and people

00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:15,950
behind it so the community is something

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,020
very it's an amazing thing in in plone

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:23,150
world as you can see it is growing very

00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:26,470
fast and on each conference you can see

00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:28,870
always additional people that are coming

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,990
and this is something that is really an

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,310
amazing thing and it makes some

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,080
difference I mean you can see the

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,140
difference comparing clone with other

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,540
open source also Python communities it's

00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:44,560
very helpful and I'm really proud to be

00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:46,870
a part of it so that was basically the

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:55,720
plone the technology and the people and

00:04:46,870 --> 00:05:02,010
now let's move to pyramid so and anyone

00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:08,980
knows something about pyramids not bad

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:16,600
so so what's pyramid it's a web

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:19,630
framework very small it's them fast and

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,570
it was basically engineered with speed

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:28,300
as a very concrete goal as you can see

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:34,780
it's almost twice fastest jungle it's

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:43,660
stable it's stable also because it is

00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:46,450
tested and very well documented so this

00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,520
is a Python framework which is not the

00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:49,930
micro framework but also not the full

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:54,370
stack frame works it's somewhere in the

00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:57,930
middle which in my opinion it's a big

00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:01,270
advantage which I will tell more later

00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,250
so this is the reason why I'm here I'm

00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,740
will try to show you some architectural

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,470
principles i will show you some examples

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:12,010
of blown deployments the python the

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:13,930
permitted deployments and how you can

00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,390
work how you can use those tools

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:25,120
together and successfully so i will

00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:29,110
start with a bad story this will be the

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:33,430
first from two use cases this one is not

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:35,289
quite successful and any similarity to

00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,590
known technologies or institutions is

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:40,210
purely coincidental so i will not try to

00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:47,770
name anything directly

00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:53,860
me but I hope you get the point so first

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:59,440
the customer the customer was a blue a

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:04,300
large public sector and tithing it has

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,870
more than one x 1000 employees and he

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,110
needs a complex intranet and the

00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:15,070
deadline was more or less two years and

00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:17,919
by the complex intranet I mean at a very

00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:20,349
specific document management system with

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:25,080
advan sophisticated workflow and

00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:31,000
security so that's that's a requirement

00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:33,210
so for that project we have choosen a

00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,210
team

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:45,819
and the first problem we made we have

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,550
mixed some roles in the project in the

00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:51,129
development process so we have the the

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,770
software architect that was some time is

00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:58,300
the project manager sometimes the

00:07:53,770 --> 00:08:00,520
developer and sometimes the tester and

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:03,550
we have also skipped the development

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,379
philosophy because we thought that we

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:08,020
will define a very small team that will

00:08:05,379 --> 00:08:14,139
work very closely together and we can be

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:17,430
as much as I as possible so as you

00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:24,729
probably think it was wrong and it was

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:29,529
so that was the team then we have also

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:31,810
chosen technology for that project and

00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:35,349
we wanted to use very cool edge complex

00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:37,419
one so not the one that already was on

00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,909
the market but we thought that we can

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:44,829
use something new that would be better

00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:46,510
than the one that exists and after that

00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:49,990
we have started to struggle with the

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:54,209
learning curve affect anybody here was

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:59,500
struggling with that problem before now

00:08:54,209 --> 00:09:01,329
impressing your lucky guys so basically

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,220
what the learning curve effect means for

00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:06,459
us it was that almost everything was a

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,010
prototype we didn't have time to deeply

00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:13,440
investigate the technology we have

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:17,130
chosen and we have been prototyping only

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,329
but that was not the video prototype so

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,699
after this learning curve perfect

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:24,850
process we have as a side effect also

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:26,680
the Technic technical design depth which

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:30,730
was more than an average technical

00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:37,839
design that both typical project so this

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:41,070
was the technology and to make a small

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:45,430
summary of this very epic failed project

00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:47,079
the main problems were the mixing role

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:50,230
so the project manager as a software

00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,279
architect as a tester in the technology

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,720
that didn't fit in

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,970
and there was no fun at all the problem

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:02,139
of the technology that didn't fit in is

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:05,410
also the fact is also because it was too

00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:11,139
complex and we have introduced to many

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:15,970
technologies which effectively increase

00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:20,110
the risk of using them so that was the

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:22,870
bad story that happened in the past a

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:26,680
long time ago I think we have learned

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:33,360
something from it and recently we have

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,360
finished the good story the good project

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,149
and in this case I will make another

00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:41,709
disclaimer in any similarity to known

00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:44,620
technologies and institutions is

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:52,180
entirely intentional so I would try to

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:56,220
main and name them directly yes so let's

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:59,740
start with the customer the customer is

00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:04,620
it's called aterna water it is a start

00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:07,389
up the new American startup it is based

00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,160
the main office is in Miami but they

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:14,139
have also offices in New York and Los

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:18,629
Angeles and as you probably can imagine

00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:18,629
they are doing something with the water

00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:29,399
yes and yes they are selling water which

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:32,259
is quite important part of the US market

00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:37,959
but they are not selling water in

00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:44,850
bottles in the traditional way they have

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:48,220
their own water wave systems which is a

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:50,170
very sophisticated magic machine that

00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:52,629
can deliver still water sparkling water

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:54,639
that tastes like well-known brands also

00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:56,949
juices and maybe in the future a chicken

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,059
soup I don't know but the machine is

00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:00,209
more or less like that they have

00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:04,389
different varieties of these machines

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:05,290
the main customer of our customers of

00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:10,149
the main customer

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:16,000
very nice restaurants bars pops all

00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:23,620
those places where you sell beverages in

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:27,940
a very an enormous number so this is the

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:35,680
customer that approaches and what did

00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:40,810
they try to build so the project

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:44,949
requirements they wanted to build the

00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:48,750
system completely paperless so they

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:51,519
wanted to make it completely digital

00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:55,630
they didn't knew exactly how to name

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,509
that system after spending months and

00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:03,750
weeks we get to the point that it was

00:12:58,509 --> 00:13:08,519
something like almost a full year p and

00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:16,980
yes so this was the main requirement

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:20,250
paperless sales and by that I mean crm a

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:25,199
sales management warehouse management

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,199
the e-commerce and the support

00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,519
the order is also important because this

00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:38,279
is more or less how the the whole

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:40,379
process is going so for the CRM they

00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,259
needed a customer management with

00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,929
satisfaction management order status and

00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:48,959
those kind of things some sophisticated

00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:52,769
reports also for the machines they were

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:58,350
selling and some alberton campaigns and

00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:59,699
this kind of stuff for the sales they

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,649
wanted to have a network management

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:04,079
sales network management so all the

00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:08,939
sales agents in the US should be somehow

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,860
connected with a tree structure with

00:14:08,939 --> 00:14:13,079
additional permissions based on that and

00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:15,809
other features they wanted to have

00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:17,639
invoicing an accountancy the revenue

00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:19,980
counter for those sales agents that will

00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:22,889
automatically count how much money did

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:26,189
they earn and also a discount management

00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:29,939
very small application that allows sales

00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:31,679
agents to discount machines for the

00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,660
warehouse they wanted to have a catalog

00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,509
management so all the products they were

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:38,699
selling only the machines but also

00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:40,949
juiciest accessories one of the

00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:44,490
accessories was a Wi-Fi it is it's not

00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:46,410
was it's a Wi-Fi card you can plug into

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,209
the machine then automatically it sends

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:50,309
information to the central server when

00:14:48,209 --> 00:14:52,889
it needs to change the filter how much

00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:56,389
water then consumes and so on so those

00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:58,350
kind of stuff was in the catalog and

00:14:56,389 --> 00:15:00,299
they need an application that will

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:02,519
manage it so there's also a warehouse

00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,910
management quite classical one and a

00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:09,029
logistic tracking so every time somebody

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,399
is moving a machine basically machine

00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:13,919
but also beverages accessories between

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:15,929
warehouses or between supplier and

00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,819
customer they need to track everything

00:15:15,929 --> 00:15:23,669
of course then there's a ecommerce which

00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:27,449
is actually an online shop for those

00:15:23,669 --> 00:15:29,309
beverages and accessory stuff there is a

00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:31,589
very sophisticated machine configurator

00:15:29,309 --> 00:15:34,290
which I'm very proud of because I made

00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:38,419
it which is actually an interactive

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:42,910
wizard for the customers in the SIS guys

00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:45,440
so it can automatically

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:47,840
proposed the best machine for the

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,260
customer so you need to in to input

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,060
provide some parameters how many

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:56,870
customers you have how many tables in

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,820
the restaurant how many waiters all the

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,760
stuff i mean there's an enormous number

00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,620
of data it collects and then based on

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:08,630
some algorithm it proposed you several

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:10,250
machines that best suits your needs so a

00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:13,700
part of the machine configurator we have

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:15,350
one also online payments and that

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,050
concludes the e-commerce part and the

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:20,690
last one is the support so every time

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,420
the machine is broken into have a filter

00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:26,240
change or an emergency service or the

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,440
whole installation process it's kept in

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,850
the support I know that the order

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,160
installation process probably doesn't

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:33,200
fit logically in this part but from the

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,390
business case point of view the customer

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:40,300
wants to put it into the support so it

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:44,540
is here so those are the requirements

00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:46,460
very shortly and also checking from the

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:48,530
business point of view we have divided

00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:50,780
it into the intranet and extranet so the

00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,580
part that is available only internally

00:16:50,780 --> 00:17:01,100
in the company and the part that is if

00:16:52,580 --> 00:17:05,090
that is exposed also to the customer so

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:08,960
just to finish the requirement parts the

00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:11,300
whole process should be paperless and I

00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,930
think we have achieved the goal the only

00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:22,160
moment when you really need to have a

00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:23,510
printed sheet is the contract but this

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,270
is a legal stuff you need to bring the

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,450
contracting to sign it and you need to

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:30,680
scan it and put into the system back so

00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:37,120
the whole process is completely

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:40,630
paperless they are also some gotcha so a

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,630
part of the fact

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,759
then we didn't know that we are building

00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:50,789
an erp from the beginning we also didn't

00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:53,159
know all the requirements because it is

00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:56,100
a start that it was a start-up so the

00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:59,669
customer didn't have and huge experience

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,620
in depth in the market so he didn't know

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,539
exactly all the details all for all

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,740
those steps in the process he didn't

00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:06,269
know exactly how the warehouse

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:10,440
management will look like or should look

00:18:06,269 --> 00:18:13,919
like and so on and so on so yes the

00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:18,929
requirements were not rock solid and we

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:22,110
need to properly choose technology so we

00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,940
can grow with the customer also not just

00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:25,950
for the first phase that has just

00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:29,100
finished but also in the future when the

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:31,529
new requirements are eyes the second

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,580
problem is that the customers in us we

00:18:31,529 --> 00:18:41,929
are in Italy so we need to carefully

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,929
plan the meetings this kind of stuff

00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:49,259
based on those two maybe not the second

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,539
one but mainly the first requirement so

00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:53,970
the first point that the requirements

00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:56,129
are not a rock-solid comes the third one

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,500
that we need to find a proper framework

00:18:56,129 --> 00:19:02,279
we didn't have huge experience before

00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,710
with small frameworks like pyramid we

00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:08,220
have mainly experience with soap and

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,820
blown it is about Python world and we

00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:16,950
knew already from the past that we are

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:21,149
not able to build and an ERP a vertical

00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,320
application in plone entirely so we need

00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:25,139
to choose something we need to find

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,220
something new and the last go chest is

00:19:25,139 --> 00:19:29,070
that we have only five months to

00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:34,039
delivery because the customer wanted to

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:38,039
show the system on some food fer in

00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:41,070
Chicago so it was a very fixed deadline

00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:47,730
and we couldn't postpone it even after a

00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:51,659
week so this concludes the requirements

00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:54,620
part and now we can try to go to the

00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:54,620
project background

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:05,700
yes actually this is nobody from the

00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:07,890
turtle so the dev team was defined in a

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:11,450
completely different way than in the in

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,670
the past projects we have explicitly

00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:17,670
defined a software architect role that

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,340
was responsible for the database design

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:22,410
and the integration layer we have also

00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,490
excluded the project manager from the

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:29,760
development team and we have divided the

00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:32,690
developers the software developers into

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,309
the plone team and pirate pyramid team

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,760
the region to do that was we wanted to

00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:42,390
minimize the risk of introducing the new

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,980
technology as you probably notice we

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:48,000
have choosen plone and pyramid which i

00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:49,860
will say in a moment why like that but

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,450
the important thing here is not blown

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,600
and pyramid the important thing is one

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,460
of the technologies in this case blown

00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,710
we already have experience we already

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,870
have a lot of experience using it the

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:04,110
second one was completing you so to not

00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:05,790
mix in the people to not force everybody

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:07,440
to learn something new and to also

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,929
minimize the risk we have divided the

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,100
team completely which means they were

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:23,190
not even working together for most of

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:25,509
the time what was the result from

00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:27,850
this choice and what Baba was the side

00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:29,679
effect of this choice first of all we

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:32,860
have if we have just found that

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,230
prototyping could be good and could be

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,929
quite satisfied you can have a lot of

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,809
satisfied from that and we have spent

00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:44,200
roughly about ten percent of our whole

00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:47,159
time for prototyping mainly of course in

00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:53,049
permit but also some parts in plone and

00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:57,039
we have also it was not just a simple

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:59,529
prototyping that we just make a draft

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,710
package that enters the production we

00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:05,080
have put this whole process into an

00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,460
ongoing process so we have been starting

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,559
with a prototyping we you have learning

00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:14,289
new things where we have been improving

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:15,879
things and also from that process the

00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:21,899
pyramid for marking newborns which I

00:22:15,879 --> 00:22:24,850
will tell at the end so yes this was

00:22:21,899 --> 00:22:26,710
very interesting discovery the second

00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:30,580
thing is that we have also discovered

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:31,720
that we need always that the sorry not

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,100
always that the collecting of the

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,169
specification is the process that is

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,549
ongoing we knew it from the beginning

00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:38,889
that the customer doesn't know exactly

00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:40,690
what he needs but believe me we didn't

00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:42,669
realize that he completely doesn't know

00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,490
certain things and we need to work very

00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:51,070
closely together and I think sometimes

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:52,960
we have also helped him to to choose

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:56,289
from the technological point of view to

00:22:52,960 --> 00:23:00,909
choose the proper thing so this was also

00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:02,409
quite time consuming task the last thing

00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:04,950
the last conclusion the last side effect

00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:09,159
was yeah we have started to have fun

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:12,429
using the software mainly pyramid but

00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:16,059
also plone but long we already knew so

00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:21,190
it was fun let's say on the same level

00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:27,549
but pyramid was fun to discover that was

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:28,899
really nice so now let's focus if we

00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:32,049
know already the customer we know the

00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:33,399
requirement we know the team we know how

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:36,000
we have configured all those things

00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:36,000
let's see

00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:42,169
what is the technology behind it and how

00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,570
we have glue together everything

00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:54,380
probably already know that it's blown

00:23:45,570 --> 00:24:00,799
and pyramids so why pyramid we have

00:23:54,380 --> 00:24:03,390
tested several Python web frameworks I

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,990
would tell more about the one that we

00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:12,540
haven't choose later we haven't chosen

00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:15,210
later the white pyramid mainly because

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:19,140
what I said already it gives you a great

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:22,500
flexibility so it's not a micro and not

00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,120
a full stack frame work it was for us

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,929
easy to learn because the architecture

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,270
is very similar to soap maybe not

00:24:27,929 --> 00:24:32,700
similar but it's not so far away let's

00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:36,480
say like that it supports equal alchemy

00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:38,309
out of the box which we have also

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,730
experienced from the past it has a great

00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:45,000
documentation and believe me or not it

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:47,490
gives you a lot of pressure during the

00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,960
development process which connects a

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,940
little bit to what I said before that it

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,600
gives you fun you can substitute it as

00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,600
you like

00:24:56,350 --> 00:25:03,830
so those are the main reasons for us why

00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,870
we have to sperm it the second thing is

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,600
that probably most of you thinks that

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:11,390
pyramid is just a black hole I mean you

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,850
just download it from from pi PI and you

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:17,270
are getting nothing right you need to

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:19,580
write everything from scratch yes that's

00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:23,150
true but the point is different the

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,070
point is that I think it is not the most

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,870
important thing that you are having full

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,880
I mean for us for that project of course

00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:33,320
it was not the most important thing to

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,180
get everything in the stack so get maybe

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:39,230
a working already RP that need to be

00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,430
configured because the requirements as I

00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,860
said at the beginning we're not clear

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:46,220
and we want to have something that is

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:47,480
flexible the second thing is that what

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,320
we have discovered is that building

00:25:47,480 --> 00:26:02,510
something in pyramid even something very

00:25:50,320 --> 00:26:07,220
quite complex like alike yes like a

00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:10,880
crude that extends the the form alchemy

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:16,250
package it's not so difficult we were

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:17,630
able to do that as a sub-project during

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:23,930
those four five months of development

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:26,330
and what is very interesting about that

00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,310
is that it is really comparing also to

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:31,360
other frameworks of course it is not as

00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:35,990
complex as what you get if you use

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,390
probably I don't know if somebody who

00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:40,040
knows something about loan he knows

00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,420
archetypes and the widgets in archetypes

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,820
there are much much more complex you

00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:46,460
have much much more of them but of

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:49,400
course in this use case we didn't you

00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,080
all we didn't need to have everything

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:55,040
what we need to have is just a multi

00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:58,130
upload widget something like like a

00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:00,260
metrics unix widget that you can just

00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:03,350
change the kilos two pounds or meters

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,630
two yards and so on remember that the

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:07,190
customers from us we need an

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,690
autocomplete widget and those kind of

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:14,669
things so building it was really

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:17,700
not difficult and so I really encourage

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:19,320
you to not be afraid of pyramids do not

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,610
be afraid of building your own stuff and

00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:28,590
share with the community and I was what

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:30,559
I would say also later what we did with

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,789
the screwed we have merged it with

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,070
pyramid from alchemy project we have

00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:38,370
release it we there was a sprint but

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:44,970
more later okay so this concludes the

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:50,100
pyramid part now wipe loan yes because

00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:53,940
it's the best CMS just like that its

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:56,789
enterprise ready it's by

00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,440
enterprise-ready I mean you have

00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:59,850
hundreds of loan companies all over the

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:02,490
world so you don't have right now

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:04,669
nowadays you don't have problem to find

00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:08,460
support you don't have problem to find

00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:11,039
deployment you don't have problem to

00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,919
find a company that will make a

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,820
tailor-made project it's made to meet

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,789
nature it's stable it has a huge

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,750
community that is actively developing it

00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:28,169
and it has a lot of atoms I will just

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:31,200
show four of them which we have been

00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:33,529
using in aterna project this is the

00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,120
first one which is the plum from jen

00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:38,399
actually it's it's a through the web

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:41,100
form generator for plone so you can give

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,559
to your end user or to your customer a

00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:46,259
powerful tool to build their own they're

00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:50,429
their own forums with very sophisticated

00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:53,159
works those actions and so on in a

00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:54,990
turnip project I mean this is what we

00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:56,610
are always struggling with this is a

00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:58,289
normal experience for the plone

00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,330
developer is that when you are giving a

00:28:58,289 --> 00:29:02,279
plone to the customer he's shocked right

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,159
I'm getting this for free yes you are

00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:06,690
getting this for free and one of the

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,120
surprises were was blown from Jen

00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:13,259
because he wanted to the customer wanted

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,870
to build and just like that very fast

00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:18,149
before this despair show you need to

00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:20,039
build a complex forum for the

00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:23,559
registration and stuff and those kind of

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:25,480
stuff instead of asking us to build it

00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,090
normally to create a forum deployed on

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,950
production and so on he was just using

00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,049
pro from jen and he was able to do it by

00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,269
himself in 20 minutes maybe a very

00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:36,820
complex form so this is really amazing

00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:39,220
part of blown the second thing that we

00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:44,799
use was its POI which is an issue

00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:46,509
tracker for plone we have been using it

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:49,149
in a Terran awful all those support part

00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:51,279
so every support every time the machine

00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:53,620
is broken every time the customer wants

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,230
an emergency call and so on we have been

00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,059
using poi it's quite complex i would

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:02,909
just don't want to go deeply into the

00:29:58,059 --> 00:30:02,909
details the important thing is that

00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:09,279
right now in the recent versions it is

00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:13,600
quite complex refactor so the code is

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:18,759
really extensible and it has nice

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:21,149
features like I mean okay probably you

00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:23,259
already struggle with the tracking

00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:26,200
applications like track more or less

00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:28,149
probably this is quite new track the

00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,710
benefit is that it isn't alone so we can

00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:32,710
connect to all the resources you have in

00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:34,899
plone you can attach or make a relation

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:36,549
to a document that is in the FAQ or in

00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:42,009
the document repository and so on and so

00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:45,190
on so this is really a powerful to die a

00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:48,610
sir this is something new that it is

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:51,909
right now called I a so before it was XD

00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,409
v this is not directly Apple own product

00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:59,289
i mean the plum product is called tronic

00:30:53,409 --> 00:31:04,419
teeny but the answer is just an approach

00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:07,210
to to take an HTML why frame and turn it

00:31:04,419 --> 00:31:09,490
into a proper team for a for your

00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,549
favorite CMS it could be blown it could

00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:16,389
be something else I don't know why the

00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:22,360
slides skips quickly but the important

00:31:16,389 --> 00:31:27,710
thing is this one sorry this one that

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:32,659
you have the this is just stop please

00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:39,500
no no no go back please why doesn't want

00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:44,539
to listen to me very bad so I will need

00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:47,029
to force him yes thank you the point is

00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:48,770
you have a static HTML that you can

00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:51,110
download from a free web resource

00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,270
whatever so this is your HTML and the

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:58,390
CSS and JavaScript whatever you are

00:31:53,270 --> 00:32:02,559
writing a file in XML that is a rule

00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:06,980
some kind of rules that were very fast

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:09,230
and now stops that are here those are

00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:12,350
the rules okay and this is the final

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:15,950
result so you can see that the the real

00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:18,200
free the Rio HTML resource with CSS and

00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:20,450
JavaScript was transformed into blown so

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,840
you are just taking apart one diff and

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,580
put it here that this diff need to be

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:28,130
here in clone this column need to be

00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,390
here and this is the concept if you are

00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:31,130
interesting there are a lot of talks

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,830
about die a so there are a lot of

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:39,470
tutorials I don't want to say anything

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:41,809
more it is really really a complete

00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:46,880
change for teaming in plone you can

00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:51,080
right now do a very nice-looking plum

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,309
teams not in weeks but in ours and the

00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,260
important thing is that you don't have

00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:56,929
this problem with complexity lon

00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,140
complexity that for the photographic guy

00:32:56,929 --> 00:33:01,850
you need to have you need to download

00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,490
few megabytes of X with dependencies you

00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:05,929
just need to give him the static HTML

00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,270
you just need to know more or less about

00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:10,520
XML and how to transform things and

00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:11,750
that's it what is new in the plot up

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,520
teaming right now you don't need to even

00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:15,740
shipped as a Python neck you just need

00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,270
to you can just create a zip file you

00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,840
can just zip the folder of the resources

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:25,010
and the rules and it works the last

00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:27,559
thing a ling what loan this is a very

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:30,679
nice product for for plone well this is

00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,649
what I said also earlier blown is very

00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,750
focused on multilingual and all those

00:33:33,649 --> 00:33:39,700
internalization stuff it's really easy

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:41,799
to create content in multiple languages

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,350
it is not I don't know if it is shipped

00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:52,480
out of the box with clone I think not no

00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:53,950
you need to download it but yes so we

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,269
are not right now using it in a turn

00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:57,700
abut we are planning to use it in the

00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:00,250
next phase because the customer will be

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,899
going to other markets like Mexico and

00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:07,020
others things so we need to keep all

00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:09,970
those things properly translated yes so

00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:14,050
this is more or less why plone and why

00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:16,780
pyramid and now let's go fast to the

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:19,810
integration part and I will try to show

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:25,320
you how we have forced pyramid to work

00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:28,320
with blown the first thing we have used

00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,810
for the integration is sequel alchemy

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,700
this is also the reason why we have

00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:35,589
chosen pyramid instead of other

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,510
frameworks for instance because it works

00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:39,730
with silicon e out of the box without

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:41,740
any problems and this is more less what

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:44,649
we did we are using phosphorous the

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:46,929
recycle alchemy part there's then then

00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:49,720
we have the shirt model shelter package

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:52,030
sorry attend our models which contains

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,560
the Justin the models from sequel

00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,270
alchemy so it doesn't have any

00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,190
dependency nader to plum native to

00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:01,329
pyramid and then it is important and

00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:03,640
reuse in those two applications the

00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:05,520
benefit of this approach is that in

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:08,890
pyramid of course you can build those

00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,020
pyramid from alchemy forums and go on

00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:12,760
with the vertical application in plone

00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:16,480
instead you can directly create some

00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,920
very fancy reports working directly on

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:21,099
python objects because you are importing

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,470
them from from the aterna models it

00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:26,050
works really well it gives you a lot of

00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:29,140
flexibility and what is also important

00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:31,869
you can completely disconnect the

00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:34,869
pyramid team from the plone team this

00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:39,310
part i mean the main part here was done

00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:41,589
by the AA by the architect guy and the

00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:43,569
plum team was reusing just the aterna

00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:47,589
models and the pyramid team was also

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:49,890
just reusing it so it also gives you the

00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:52,910
stability because you don't need to I

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:54,470
mean you minimize the

00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:55,880
the problem that somebody miss an

00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,380
attribute or something you just have one

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,070
repository for your models you are using

00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:03,110
it in both applications the second

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:07,490
integration part was the authentication

00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:09,410
and authorization yes this is more or

00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,220
less than at the concept we we have in

00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:17,090
in the project in aterna project we have

00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:19,940
to type of request I mean at the end the

00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:22,700
request is one but it is using different

00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:25,460
paths so if the path matches the plone

00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:29,270
part for the authentication we are using

00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:31,250
pass plugging say sequel alchemy if it

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,160
matched the pyramid but it we are using

00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:36,470
just the repos who plugins SI which is

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,960
the default in there's a default

00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:43,580
plugging in repose who we are not using

00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,440
we are not lunch and we aren't using

00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,480
plone in the whiskey environment so we

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,460
could of course our chief we can

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,310
simplify everything by just using repos

00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:55,220
hoop for both but then we will need to

00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:57,500
change the architecture quite a lot and

00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:00,430
just disconnect plone from the zeo

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,720
cluster and so on and just reuse

00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:06,020
probably not whiskey in apache to serve

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,120
both we didn't want to do that we have

00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:10,700
good experience with using zero

00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:13,750
clustering so we didn't want to

00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:17,420
introduce too much of the new staff

00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:20,240
remembering still the bed story so this

00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:24,350
is our approach and the storage is of

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:27,700
course possible so in the postgres we

00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:30,830
are keeping the users groups and roles

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:33,440
we are keeping them for both plant and

00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:35,800
pyramid so when you are using this past

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,080
plug in sa for plone it automatic

00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,230
automatically substitute the default

00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,390
blown security right so you are not

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,100
storing users anymore in zero DB you are

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:48,140
not storing users in Polonia using them

00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:52,940
you are storing them in plone in in

00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:55,780
progress also the groups and also the

00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:58,820
roles because the plone security is

00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:03,590
based on those two we have simplified

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:05,900
the authorization part in pyramids we

00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:07,010
are actually using just a simple group

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,660
mapping so we are

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:12,650
you just add the user to a group and

00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:14,180
then in the code we are attaching the

00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:17,150
group to certain functionalities and

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,800
certain permissions we have also the

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:22,400
single sign-on which was quite trivial

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,930
and not complicated to add in plone in

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,510
the in the bundle you have already up

00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:31,400
long session plugging that is using the

00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:34,070
Model T so this is what you have in

00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,620
plone in repo in pyramid you have repos

00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,300
who plugin that is doing exactly the

00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,920
same the only thing you need to just

00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,080
define and configure is the sure key

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,400
that need to be the same and the same

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:47,930
cookie name after that it works maybe

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,330
not directly out of the box you need to

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:55,570
make some very small patches in repose

00:38:50,330 --> 00:39:00,290
who plugin is exactly but after that

00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:02,420
everything works very smoothly so we

00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:07,340
have the sequel alchemy we have the

00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:10,070
authentication and authorization and the

00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,630
last part of the integration part is the

00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,690
build-out we are using build out for the

00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,460
deployment and because we are using the

00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,860
same Python version we are using Python

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,930
to the 64 both blown and pyramids you

00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,220
can just very easily even if you are

00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,600
using different versions you can also do

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,520
that but in this case it is even more

00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:30,380
easier so we are just using one build

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,670
out to rule them all and the benefit

00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,390
also from this approach is that you can

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:36,650
share the generic configuration in the

00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,870
same deal of you can reuse some

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,370
environment variables and this kind of

00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:43,270
stuff and share them in both blonde and

00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:46,520
pyramids like database connection string

00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:48,830
and so on and so on as you can see also

00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:52,010
that terminal models are shirt in both

00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:54,140
clone and permit so this is just the

00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:59,210
glue we are just yeah we are gluing the

00:39:54,140 --> 00:40:03,170
whole staff with this builder last look

00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:06,350
on the on the project itself so in front

00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:08,330
we have in front we have apache then we

00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:10,820
have also beaker which we are using for

00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:16,460
sharing the session we have a very very

00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:18,440
tiny application that is using it so I

00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,450
was not mentioning it but this is an

00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:22,730
additional another part

00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:27,320
the integration you can reuse there's a

00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:30,470
collective dhikr that very easily plugs

00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:32,210
into the plone and there is a beaker I

00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,200
think I remember exactly the package

00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:35,359
name but there's also a bigger

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,450
implementation for pyramid or repose bfg

00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:41,060
but I think pyramid also and actually

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:45,410
you just need to configure it properly

00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:46,970
and then you just reuse it so we have

00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,700
the beaker we have the past plugins and

00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:52,040
repose who stuff for the authentication

00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:54,109
and authorization we are reusing

00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,810
postgres in both blown and pyramids and

00:40:54,109 --> 00:41:02,480
blown is also using for the internal

00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:04,339
blown part is using the ADB and if it's

00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,810
about the internet extranet part it is

00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:10,130
more or less like that so the majority

00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:12,619
part of extra net is done in plone also

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:17,210
from the user experience point of view

00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:19,820
I'm blown is much much better developed

00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,040
it has more I mean it has better using

00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:25,339
interface and user experience than our

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,170
crude in pyramid of course so the crude

00:41:25,339 --> 00:41:29,450
part is for the customer for the

00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:31,400
internal customer usage so for the

00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:35,990
infinite and the unknown is used for the

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:38,270
extranet and having this sure storage in

00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:44,540
posterous we can reuse the data whenever

00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:47,210
we want okay so this concludes the

00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:50,710
integration part i have only mentioned

00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:55,839
here those three men three main things

00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,839
of course this concept can be later

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,099
extent and you can add another piece of

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,890
software that is integrating it but the

00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:05,810
important thing is that according to me

00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,810
and according to us this is a very good

00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:09,859
starting point so based on that you can

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:11,359
based on this project you can see that

00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:15,319
it is possible and you can extend it

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:19,369
later so now it's the part for why not

00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:24,819
other competitors so why we didn't use

00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:24,819
other other technologies

00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:36,420
before I will show another slides I have

00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:38,520
few questions to ask how many of you was

00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:47,370
using at least once Django in a

00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:51,050
production project okay drupal yes we

00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:57,450
have drupal users here as well open erp

00:42:51,050 --> 00:43:02,150
not so many don't be shy plone ends up

00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:06,630
pure soap pure abusers yes yes also okay

00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:11,270
so it's more or less equal weight not

00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:17,010
afraid so first thing is why not Django

00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:19,020
well actually I think it should be right

00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:20,310
now obvious for everybody why we didn't

00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:26,070
use Django we didn't use jungle because

00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:29,490
it for us it was too complex let's code

00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:35,970
more magic so the important thing is

00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:39,750
that we didn't want to based on

00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:42,720
something that is quite complex that we

00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:46,370
didn't have any experience before at

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,290
least production experience let's say

00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:53,070
all the obstacles are the sequel alchemy

00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:55,230
that using it in in Django is tricky I

00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:57,390
know it is possible but i think it's

00:43:55,230 --> 00:44:02,130
tricky maybe maybe i'm wrong but this is

00:43:57,390 --> 00:44:04,350
what we investigated and yes and this is

00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:08,520
not flexible framework so for us at

00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:10,770
least and for this project so for us the

00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,270
point that the specification is growing

00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:14,150
and this is the same problem we have in

00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:17,700
the in the bed story i was saying before

00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:20,070
this was a red alert for us i mean do

00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:24,140
not use something that probably in the

00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:28,770
future you will sperm sperm or time

00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:30,510
monkey patching or doing some very nasty

00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:33,390
gluing instead of building something

00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:36,240
from from sketch even if you need it so

00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:38,990
this is this was our approach and until

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,990
now it was quite successful

00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:47,720
so why not drupal also a CMS it has a

00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:50,900
nice community and it's quite popular

00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:59,480
yet the security problems are obvious

00:44:50,900 --> 00:45:01,770
lon has only 16 drupal 370 and fries

00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:06,140
then there's the integration problem of

00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:09,210
course we wanted something in Python and

00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:11,580
which of course is this doable you can

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:15,690
integrate Drupal if with pyramid or if

00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:18,300
with Python stuff if you want why you

00:45:15,690 --> 00:45:22,140
should and the last part is missing

00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:25,590
features for us which are you we are

00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,990
using plone for for ages things like

00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:30,900
workflow and complex security or a

00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:32,790
complex ACL is something standard you

00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,880
are getting it for free you are getting

00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:37,290
it out of the box and we didn't want to

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,890
use it of course we didn't want to lose

00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:43,440
it of course for certain use cases you

00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:46,380
can convince the customer that he can

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:48,390
have something not so advanced and so on

00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:52,830
but for this project it was a it was a

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:55,380
failure so we couldn't use it the last

00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:59,310
thing that probably you will think why

00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:05,610
we didn't use for the ear p project why

00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:09,510
we didn't use open ear p well as i said

00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:11,510
in the slide it is not that we didn't

00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:15,240
want to use it it's more like hmm

00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:17,130
because first of all from the first

00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:18,900
approach and from certain discussions

00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:20,790
with the community and the developers

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:25,050
that are using it we get an impression

00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:26,220
that this is also quite complex and of

00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,300
course you are getting a lot of things

00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:32,730
for free but then you're getting to this

00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,800
to this problem with the complexity

00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:36,180
monkey patching and tuning up configure

00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:42,300
a ting and all the stuff that we wanted

00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:43,740
to avoid the second very regular matical

00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,720
problem is that we didn't have enough

00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,520
time to engine fully investigated

00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,460
because we don't we have those five

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:52,230
months deadline and we didn't want to

00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,850
spend half of this time for prototyping

00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:58,170
and searching so we just spent

00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:59,520
just ten percent and honestly the second

00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:01,680
framework we have been testing was

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:06,300
pyramid and I didn't wanted to change it

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:09,720
so maybe open erp here would be a great

00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:14,340
thing I don't know if somebody has

00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:15,650
similar projects done in opening up Lee

00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:19,920
I want to share after the talk i'm

00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:22,080
really curious to hear about that okay i

00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,550
think we have something around 13

00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:30,900
minutes so i will show you also the

00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:35,040
following slides that were optional yes

00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:39,060
the result so the whole project as i

00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:40,620
said this pyramid and clone based but

00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,350
this is just the architecture this was

00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:44,730
our decision for the customer especially

00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:49,170
for the internet and for the extranet

00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:54,030
part it shouldn't be clear shouldn't be

00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:57,000
obvious and we shouldn't show when we

00:47:54,030 --> 00:48:00,180
are moving from blown to pyramid and

00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,210
from perimeter P 422 blown the interface

00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:06,150
a part of the fact that the internet is

00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:10,200
not so rich because it's done in permit

00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:14,480
and blown is more sophisticated the

00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:14,480
overall layout should be very similar so

00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:22,110
the plone part looks more or less like

00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,680
that right it is not a very typical

00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:29,670
blown skin because we are not using all

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:33,900
of the plan features here what is common

00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:36,690
for both permanent loan is the top bar

00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:41,550
so the logo and the navigation and also

00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:45,450
the user personalization stuff they are

00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:47,940
common this is another slide with

00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:53,040
another view this at the end the main

00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:55,740
part is a typical typical plone typical

00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,080
plus side this is the view of the if the

00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:01,000
emergency part with the the support part

00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:05,410
as you can see here

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:07,180
and this is the documentation part this

00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:14,110
is actually right now and this is a

00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:15,370
forum so they can use a forum inside the

00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,080
Internet next on it so they can

00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,970
communicate with their customers and

00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:24,040
they can communicate internally in the

00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:28,260
company so this is blown now let's see

00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:34,300
how pyramid what looks like the ends

00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:37,510
very similar you can see the nice forum

00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,740
alchemy part and the rest is very

00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:42,000
similar you have the port that you have

00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:42,000
the top bar and the rest is the same

00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:51,880
this is one of the most complex models

00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:54,040
that we have so the product itself to

00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,840
the catalogue part it has something

00:49:54,040 --> 00:50:01,270
around 150 attributes with different

00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:06,220
widgets the the multi one the multi up

00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:09,340
loud one the render multi multi relation

00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,660
part how to complete all the stuffs it

00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,880
works very fast we didn't have the

00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,400
problem that sometimes exists in ARCA

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,490
times when you are building a very

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,770
complex archetype in plone you can get

00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:25,900
some problems with performance of

00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:27,250
rendering all those stuff here we didn't

00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,800
notice any and we didn't make any

00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:32,920
sophisticated stress tests but for those

00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:34,590
use cases for more than 100 fields with

00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:38,290
complex widgets we didn't find any

00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:41,320
performance issues the second slide this

00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:44,880
is more or less dashboard so an entry

00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:48,460
point for the customer you don't see any

00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:50,080
any real life data here I was just

00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:52,840
making the screenshot quite fast so

00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:57,810
normally here you have you have all the

00:50:52,840 --> 00:51:01,360
data fill in and this is also pyramid

00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:05,310
those this is a typical for marking you

00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:10,620
widget based on of course require ue and

00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:13,780
the last part some reports stuff and

00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:14,500
that's it so this is the pyramid part

00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:17,800
but

00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:21,370
of blown and pyramid and a part of the

00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:24,910
typical web use case the customer also

00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:32,650
wanted to have a small part that will

00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:35,710
work only in iPad so we did also a

00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:37,480
partner for for iPads only this is the

00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,000
Machine configurator I was telling you

00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:44,890
before that allows the sales agent and

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:48,940
the customers to configure eight the

00:51:44,890 --> 00:51:51,640
dream machine let's say those are all

00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:56,140
the data they need to fill in after that

00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:57,520
you are getting some beverages to choose

00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,460
if you want to have apples or oranges

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:04,180
that will be filling in or whatever if

00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:07,350
you want to steal water or sparkling you

00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:12,370
are providing some typical addresses

00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:15,880
stuff and some statistical information

00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:19,800
so this part actually the ipad part was

00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:22,180
not built using for Malkin II because

00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:24,310
the form alchemy and pyramid from

00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:26,860
alchemy especially it is great for for

00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:29,770
the typical web use case so for the

00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:32,070
browser and for the browser for the for

00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,800
the PC let's say and this kind of stuff

00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:37,210
the ipad part was very tricky to do it

00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:38,740
properly because as you can see the

00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:41,200
interface is quite rich there are a lot

00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:43,420
of things that need to fit in and this

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:47,830
is basically a custom template so we

00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:49,570
didn't want to customize the whole

00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:52,270
pyramid for mark any part just to have

00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:57,990
four or five screens for the wizard so

00:52:52,270 --> 00:53:02,410
we did it actually information which was

00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:07,620
actually not a big deal so this is the

00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:16,330
ipad part and that concludes the whole

00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:22,420
good story project and now two slides of

00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:24,340
of a summary what matters after all

00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:29,460
those experience the bet experience and

00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:31,690
the good experience I have found that

00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:33,750
one of the important thing is to find

00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:35,890
proper tools I know it is not very

00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:38,380
bright and probably most of you already

00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:41,460
knew it but i will still repeat it

00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:45,130
because I think sometimes there's a very

00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:49,420
big temptation to use a very edgy

00:53:45,130 --> 00:53:53,050
technology and what is important is to

00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:55,410
find the proper balance so the project

00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:58,540
should consist something which is

00:53:55,410 --> 00:54:00,100
innovative but the math the major part

00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:03,640
should be built on the things that you

00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:05,200
already knew so this is not only about

00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:07,330
the framework part not only about the

00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:12,570
CMS which you are using but also about

00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:16,780
the CSS toolkit for example I remember

00:54:12,570 --> 00:54:22,600
for the bad story project we also use a

00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:24,430
very nice javascript toolkit the XJS far

00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:26,440
the right now i know i think it's not

00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:31,330
called xjs anymore or maybe it is i

00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:34,780
don't know but we have used it for the

00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:37,810
project it was rich with widgets it was

00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:40,870
very fancy and the problem is that we

00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:43,720
have also struggled with the learning

00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:46,180
curve effect it is really nice for the

00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:48,910
for the very easy demo but when you want

00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:53,140
to customize it when you want to fix

00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:55,240
some very very deep problem you are

00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:58,350
spending weeks and you are not

00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:01,810
productive so finding a proper tools

00:54:58,350 --> 00:55:05,800
that will be smart enough and that will

00:55:01,810 --> 00:55:11,260
fit into the project is the first

00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:13,330
important thing the second is the roles

00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:15,970
in the project and this one depends of

00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:17,770
course very much on the on the scale of

00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:23,410
the project how big is it and how long

00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:25,000
it will run but what I see and this is

00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:27,970
also probably obvious for some of you

00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,500
that was doing a complex project and

00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:30,370
we're working in a big themes and so on

00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:33,760
that mixing the

00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:37,300
walls so doing things that you should

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:40,150
not intend to do in most of the cases is

00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:43,600
wrong because then you are losing the

00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:49,120
responsibility in the team and you are

00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:51,700
losing the productivity and this is one

00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:53,770
of the things that in our case we have

00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:56,590
improved a lot comparing the bed story

00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:58,750
to the good story so I think I really

00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:03,670
strongly advise you to rethink sometimes

00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:07,240
when we think the cases when you think

00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:09,700
it is better to have a MacGyver in the

00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:14,650
project that is doing everything I think

00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:18,280
it is not always good so we had four

00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:23,920
minutes left I would go right now to the

00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:27,460
last part what's next what's next is

00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:29,530
basically about the pyramid croute that

00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:32,350
I was already saying before this is what

00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:34,750
we did for this is the part of the

00:56:32,350 --> 00:56:39,420
software that we develop for the form

00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:43,840
generation and for the widgets so do not

00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:46,120
manually wrote all those forms we have

00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:50,110
based on the on the kelpie I don't know

00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:54,940
how to pronounce it honestly on this

00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:57,670
prototype that was written by by CLG it

00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:01,060
uses sequel alchemy for the models from

00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:03,610
alchemy for the forms and optionally you

00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:06,160
can also use fa jquery which extends the

00:57:03,610 --> 00:57:08,710
jquery doing right now it is known as

00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:13,060
pyramid from ankeny and what we did last

00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:15,490
week there was a very small micro sprint

00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:17,320
in ferrara in red turtle office and we

00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:18,730
have been trying to merge and i think we

00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:21,340
did it quite successfully which i would

00:57:18,730 --> 00:57:23,200
tell any moment merge all those code

00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,810
that we did for the aterna with the

00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:30,490
pyramid firm count alchemy that was

00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:33,550
developed by guile the maintainer of the

00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:38,740
form alchemy package so what we have

00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:42,040
accomplished right now comparing to what

00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:44,220
was before we have the even hooks so you

00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:48,390
don't need to monkey patch your

00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:50,880
kroot framework to modify the model

00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:54,690
before you save it or before you delete

00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:57,480
it you just can subscribe to that event

00:57:54,690 --> 00:57:59,820
we have the custom view customizations

00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,640
of view and actions so if you want to

00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:05,040
have a different view for one of the

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:07,710
models doesn't matter if it's listing

00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:09,000
edit one of the crude views if you want

00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:12,210
to customize it you can use the sub

00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,520
component architecture and register a

00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:18,480
custom v for that we have right now also

00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:21,750
the internalization support one of the

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,480
widgets that we missed in the pyramid a

00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:27,060
formal candy was the autocomplete one it

00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,740
is there then we have also the Pacer

00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:31,770
templates so right now it should be very

00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:34,380
easy to start up your project if you

00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:38,520
want to taste test it I will show you in

00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:41,359
a moment how to do that really easy the

00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:44,099
plans what we have also started to do is

00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:51,680
define static integration anybody is

00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:51,680
familiar with fun static yes it's a very

00:58:51,950 --> 00:59:02,880
fantastic middleware that first of all

00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:07,550
you can just try to imagine if it will

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,660
be amazingly great to be able to write

00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:12,060
JavaScript dependencies like we are

00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:14,310
doing in the Python packages so you can

00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:16,830
just say that the pyramid from alchemy

00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:19,109
depends on sequel alchemy greater than

00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:23,849
zero dot seven and you just write it in

00:59:19,109 --> 00:59:26,070
your setup bi and you don't care how it

00:59:23,849 --> 00:59:28,109
works but it works this is more or less

00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,940
what you can do with the fan static you

00:59:28,109 --> 00:59:33,119
can make the dependency between the

00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:35,670
JavaScript that you are using of course

00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:39,570
it is much much more but this is one of

00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:44,660
the its greatest features and this is

00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:48,420
the plan we have a very good start up I

00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:50,960
don't know how how how complex it is

00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,960
right now how

00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:59,220
okay it's almost done it's almost done

00:59:56,310 --> 01:00:03,660
right so this is the pay certain player

00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:05,910
I was saying just peep inside pyramid

01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:07,620
from alchemy and then paste paste or

01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:10,290
create pyramid from alchemy in your

01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:12,780
application it would create you the

01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:14,550
typical demo pyramid from alchemy

01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,980
application using the fa jquery all the

01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:19,110
new stuff that i was shown before you

01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:22,380
can play with it you can see how easy is

01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:25,110
to define models and get out of the box

01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:27,810
nice forums and so on more details are

01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:30,720
available on our blog post so we can see

01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:33,930
the whole summary of the sprint and i

01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:37,620
would like to thanks again to the

01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:42,380
sprinters to guile to patrick that is

01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:42,380
here i think we can have a small ovation

01:00:45,290 --> 01:00:50,930
thanks to them we were able to achieve

01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:55,080
all those things in actually three days

01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:56,730
without not being quite productive i

01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:58,680
will not say anything more on what is

01:00:56,730 --> 01:01:01,020
important is that we have right now the

01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,020
new releases of pyramid from alchemy nfa

01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:05,790
jquery they are fresh from yesterday

01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:07,200
everything that i was just saying all

01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:12,050
the documentation everything is updated

01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,050
you can go there lunch the spacer script

01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:28,940
that was here and voila and i think this

01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:31,940
one was the last slide yes that's it

01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,940
thank

01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:46,839
are there any questions how did you how

01:01:44,259 --> 01:01:49,089
did you add v how do you did you manage

01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:50,769
four page templates for for both sides

01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:55,779
they look very similar that you share

01:01:50,769 --> 01:02:00,460
them somehow or or not I mean between

01:01:55,779 --> 01:02:02,680
plot and pyramid yes no we they are made

01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:05,650
completely separate I mean the design is

01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,900
the same of course the CSS is and I

01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:10,930
think thirty forty percent similar a

01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:13,150
shirt but the HTML is done from scratch

01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:16,089
we have a temptation to use dial maybe

01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:19,479
all that may be more deliverance to to

01:02:16,089 --> 01:02:21,069
skin both of them but honestly we

01:02:19,479 --> 01:02:24,779
thought that this would be faster at the

01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:24,779
end the views are not very complex

01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:37,930
anybody else okay thank you very much

01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:40,539
and I hope you at least try pyramid from

01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:43,589
alchemy and pyramid for your next

01:02:40,539 --> 01:02:43,589
