mr. illustrate the working with seven

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:19,010
this is my work from the macrophages are

00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:22,870
suggesting advertisement to the web page

00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:27,680
to listen I love the scrubbing date

00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:32,629
installment extraction my presentation

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,360
is organized in full on background what

00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:37,040
is the context of advertising and the

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,170
difference between a collector

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:45,760
advertising and thus also searched and

00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:50,360
what is this graphical form of therapy

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,180
by seven and the application of wrapping

00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:57,170
techniques for the extraction day for

00:00:53,180 --> 00:01:00,950
advertising I finish with a conclusion

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,800
in their future direction all right

00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:08,899
Alberta me is a major source of income

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:11,830
for most the website 209 the plasma is

00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:15,640
that of the Commerce and in a

00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:20,410
page they didn't feel that for promotion

00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:22,840
their website is the principal is a

00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:30,400
sponsored search and the content for

00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:35,290
advertising total search is taking with

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,110
the advertiser by a set of the K words

00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:42,220
if for example work the website and

00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:46,450
design for need your website the user

00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:51,820
search in these cables for example

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:57,630
website and desire will be displayed the

00:01:51,820 --> 00:02:01,030
site of advertiser in religion position

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,520
in this picture can you see the

00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:08,200
difference between a response or

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:13,510
searched and the Thunder link not

00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:18,489
sponsored context advertising is a way

00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:21,190
always if advertising appropriate to the

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:24,989
content of the web page the visible

00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:29,160
service of context are advertised in is

00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:29,160
google with google adsense

00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,819
the other is replacing the variation on

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,049
their components between the content of

00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:44,830
the page and the other context what

00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:48,329
matters is the integration of offer

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:52,750
content and advertising rotation

00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:56,409
circular advertising is a takings that

00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:00,010
starting from URL finds the webpage link

00:02:56,409 --> 00:03:04,980
and scrubbing each link and found and

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,980
selected advertising for a proposal and

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:17,340
what is the shopping thanks so I was

00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:21,250
describing serving a definition are

00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:27,730
different from ice road and scrape is

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:31,260
only a way to report some data from all

00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:36,700
the way famous who knew machine UPC and

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:40,139
so we created a total erase all the

00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:45,280
trays in use data structures of happy

00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:50,019
but nowadays is also serving the nickel

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,270
to chef data from all sides and also

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:59,440
from

00:03:52,270 --> 00:04:06,770
cider with the web to Leo or more

00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:09,530
difficult with the is EA and center of

00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:15,320
the sort of JavaScript to the

00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:19,510
technologies so with the web scraping we

00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,460
create the spider that can grab

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:27,160
information from the Lancer what would

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:31,850
what we want in AP type of site and

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:36,800
obviously there are a lot of libraries

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:42,230
in python that had these features and

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:45,170
the most important as the known as a

00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:48,500
beautiful opal they have some

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:52,460
restriction because there's a twist good

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:57,470
blend but it lacks a some more Busta

00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:04,970
features it was mechanized it's like a

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:08,990
robot to which you can program each step

00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:13,400
of your stripping technique le smile

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:18,820
have some information about the XML

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:25,460
Sandra xslt Sandra so you can go through

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:30,680
deep inside your XML or HTML structure

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:36,400
very well so html5 lieber is an

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:42,780
extension with you can use it also html5

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:46,380
file and so you have only and this

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:50,070
will you desire you a lovely the poverty

00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:53,669
rate with last Sanders that lacks on LP

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:59,610
smile straight my white peers where we

00:05:53,669 --> 00:06:05,490
are or the sample from swiping some of

00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:13,290
these I scrappy is a more flexible for a

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:16,980
little project but and beulah also the

00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:22,070
ability office sometimes like template

00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:27,980
and so you can create such as our

00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:32,760
example for creation of more difficult

00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:39,919
scraping died so there are also some

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:45,320
other libraries from last web

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:48,660
technologies like a web 2.0 and

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:51,240
JavaScript last technologies like a

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:56,940
booty were people including my cookie

00:06:51,240 --> 00:07:01,460
for or by side with a computer you can

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:06,240
use like a browser library so you can

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:09,810
load or data from our site ringlets we

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:14,210
blend with the site with JavaScript so

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:19,229
the clicker on the bottom of form our

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:22,890
you have to use the JavaScript daughter

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:27,539
liquor order double get what you want

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:31,880
and Peter from exaction accommodate an

00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:36,150
order will data with JavaScript

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:40,740
interaction with other HTML unit is a

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:43,710
uncle facebook invite on with the HTML

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:47,969
you eat Britain server with the in Java

00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:51,389
so you have to actually kill me are you

00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:54,559
with Joe server running and HTML you

00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:58,709
were invited to interact with this

00:07:54,559 --> 00:08:06,119
selenium is another big project to

00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:10,099
interact with something of this same

00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:13,669
technology her bra is based on xarna

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:18,049
that is a project of modular suite

00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:21,719
promote shell is a another library to

00:08:18,049 --> 00:08:28,979
interaction with chrome google chrome

00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:34,019
browser and this is the most speed way

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:37,829
to add grab of sight in new technologies

00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:43,349
because they were only to run from with

00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:47,689
the distraction of shell and give it a

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:51,569
port with this arabic of Python you can

00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:54,470
try to connect to come in your words in

00:08:51,569 --> 00:08:58,470
your everywhere when you run chrome and

00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:03,779
you can open top interact with chrome

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:07,800
very motley Bezos by autumn this is like

00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:13,500
a robot to with decided for the monkeys

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:17,120
and library that also in the materials

00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,850
we grew and at ever sometimes lycra

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:26,519
Travis creeping right side parag is used

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:29,579
I think's in a earrings text browser to

00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:35,660
incorporate javascript file watcher is a

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:35,660
another way to interact with firefox and

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:43,550
this is all library to Lulu and

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:48,529
beautiful so that is used in a new tour

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:54,440
brothers and is the simple one and you

00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:58,160
can have some shortcut to to go get what

00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:05,410
you want unless I'm this is an example

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:10,610
for a login login process so yeah II

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:16,600
finding your page the partial fielder

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:21,230
and and then I try to put rain and

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:25,600
naming by you all your input and then I

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:31,970
put the upper on your salad laughlin

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:34,730
same things we make nice recognizes you

00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:41,120
can witness you can program step-by-step

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:44,030
your spider daughters and so you have to

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,589
create another browser and I often you

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:53,690
every word and then select from like a

00:10:48,589 --> 00:10:59,230
beautiful should like and the creation

00:10:53,690 --> 00:11:06,140
of this object ragazza and allow you to

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:12,280
try to put on socks on some the dishes

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:17,870
all filled for input on your corporation

00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:21,459
because the SEC former Lord your form

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:22,910
from the website and you can put data

00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:26,300
like

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:29,579
oxidation and violin and then yesterday

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:34,860
zooming all to the solder and you get

00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:39,889
the answers as Rogers and so go on with

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:44,579
vehicle with Ray's implementation in 27

00:11:39,889 --> 00:11:46,739
in this world using a method or option

00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:50,100
offered by beautiful super and no

00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:53,429
mechanism how to our pristine techniques

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:56,639
to contact for opportunity it is block

00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:59,999
diagram are summarized the disturbed for

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,600
disruption in his prototype of creating

00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:08,970
a analogy only a southeast partner

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:14,749
because dynamic has been a dynamic model

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:19,079
is more difficult so the first step

00:12:14,749 --> 00:12:24,119
consists of extracting paintings listen

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:30,889
I write in a vital sweet something at

00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:36,420
work you are L rattles a list of insert

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:41,490
this URL for example Ryan dot-com in

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:44,910
some cell for rationing extra fine

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:47,760
English the information

00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:51,200
websites or on webpages or attendance or

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,200
what closin in

00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:08,240
 is the revenge and the link is in

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:11,840
this veranda for XM page in second step

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:16,240
i extracted the sorcerer code for

00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:19,490
disrupting is the elevator for for these

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:24,590
techniques I use it you are a leader in

00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:27,950
here fish fish that slop in distance

00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:32,380
code and find their ass in this version

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,380
whereas only the service partner

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,800
application of strapping in takings

00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:45,860
contextual advertising so children are

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:51,410
given it first in this is possible as by

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:58,280
using porn oreo simply insulating fills

00:13:51,410 --> 00:14:01,580
the ural linker linguist point in any

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:05,390
unit xbox of searching his way the

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:09,520
surfaces return a list of leads right

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:09,520
and a coordinate with our villains

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,920
for each bravery the following the model

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,250
excess the zoo school will come over it

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:27,240
by your labor at this point a of two

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:33,630
possibility a work with link on working

00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:39,870
with a all to death this is a picture of

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:46,820
the people i have used for the

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:51,630
extracting their purpose in the problem

00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:55,440
is a method of the option offered by

00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:58,740
mechanized and beautiful super i take

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:06,990
the body and extract detection in the

00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:10,230
tagger a colonel work of class in asia

00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:16,200
the link advertising inside you can see

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:18,140
a piece of was analyzed and found all

00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,550
the nice this is a proposed

00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,010
advertisement taken proposed it

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:29,720
according to a given assuming a

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:32,820
certain level of relevance or run bf3

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:37,110
Capilouto theater is a website on i

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:39,900
driving is a teaspoon of advertisement

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,390
or shocker this basically arrived it

00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:45,750
others Jason official advertisement to

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:50,370
eat to design of it I dealings and it's

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:55,700
rather the arts exactly need from the

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,700
school of eat a bigger one or running

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:03,819
Eternal Word star is one of

disney's analyzed the peonies and find

arrival into the police to us and

00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:17,829
related for beautiful and are related to

00:16:11,019 --> 00:16:27,059
apartment of souls he has a for romney

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:31,680
said also all on proposal enough with

00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:31,680
according or even policy

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:42,239
this project and one meter suggesting

00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:44,939
suitable as forgiving web page to listen

00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:49,229
early decision written in Python data

00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:54,839
ASAP as enemies of Europe Asia randomly

00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:57,660
sex for us except advisor in future

00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,539
water to re-scrub in taking support

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:08,069
dynamic advertising socialist ours

00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:12,559
according to user interest question or

00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,559
throbbing by who

00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:23,979
statim and for data of question about

00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:26,669
your visa thanks to university of

00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:26,669
gambling

00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:58,609
you say that this is to suggest some ads

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:02,029
that would be suitable for a game of a

00:17:58,609 --> 00:18:06,200
patient yes this is something like you

00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:08,919
you get the worst like horse riding

00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:13,489
equipment and so on and then we'll

00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:16,340
display some ass related media saw for

00:18:13,489 --> 00:18:22,460
horse equipment or somewhere to high

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:27,470
horse or something is it is it is a way

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:29,889
to earn money from this tiny to get

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,889
money out

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,740
it's a possible

00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:55,089
with anything you can optimize it or

00:18:49,059 --> 00:19:01,070
possible mine because his technology

00:18:55,089 --> 00:19:08,019
allow you to optimize the presence of us

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:16,190
on the page and so you can tell order

00:19:08,019 --> 00:19:20,239
what the website he started I de comer

00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:25,099
side but this is not the aim of this

00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:30,379
water exposure to these beautiful stages

00:19:25,099 --> 00:19:38,059
about the possibility to grab arts from

00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:48,159
websites in unmarked away and thanks to

00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:55,869
the old other day gasps you set a summer

00:19:48,159 --> 00:20:04,359
diorama with the presence of other in a

00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:04,359
set of time and so he ran something

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:13,519
global information about the side and

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:21,639
vegetable thrust inside so is the mango

00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:25,669
course but with this technique you can

00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:31,909
grab from internet not to put on

00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:33,889
something to change something on the

00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:39,740
roadside that they look and know that

00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:43,220
axis but these Hugh

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:49,820
welcome your web page and you wanted to

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:53,570
check users preference ISA you have to

00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:57,820
use something like JavaScript but part

00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:00,950
is running inshallah if you want about

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:05,929
with the scrubbing technique for your

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:09,800
service is losers because if you have

00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:13,429
your partisan like in Django you are

00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:17,740
going to use is a big job definition for

00:21:13,429 --> 00:21:22,690
getting the other from other side of you

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,690
another question

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:36,660
so if I'm understanding your

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:39,000
presentation renegade what you're doing

00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,919
is you're looking at all websites that

00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,299
already have as point of view and

00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:49,970
pulling out those ass and are getting

00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:49,970
zero you is that correct

00:21:54,119 --> 00:22:00,959
I understand well it seems that have

00:21:59,189 --> 00:22:03,979
grown to my past that are already

00:22:00,959 --> 00:22:03,979
whenever sir

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:33,590
is a bit of articles for automatically

00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:36,580
proposed of advertisement revenues in in

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,580
future with

00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:50,900
is in with the assertion again he's a

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,900
phase of project

00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,810
gotcha

00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,129
listen

00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,110
also louder than anything wrong

00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,970
I'm straightening in the past you can

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,940
destroy be particularly as you'd assume

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,880
you listed many tools there do you

00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:35,290
recommend one or few jewels for people

00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:37,530
who have a bad way of showing them at

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,530
all

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:56,090
what is a big question because you have

00:23:49,310 --> 00:24:00,920
to use the elaborate you with the with

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:03,950
the urine with the love you selected you

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:08,660
have to do what you want so did I

00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:12,800
beliefs perfect and we what we want to

00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:17,470
do because some eyebrows are better for

00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:22,300
one Oscar but not for other one so the

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:26,830
multi Broncos I need to move of

00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:33,290
represented but for some ice cream or

00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:40,760
paralyzed you were to use I only one or

00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:43,070
two and so the main difference between

00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,830
the first least the signal is the

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:49,100
proposal is the first lease if you start

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:53,870
your side and simplicity program on the

00:24:49,100 --> 00:25:00,490
side right and so the best one if you

00:24:53,870 --> 00:25:08,660
want to start to newspaper I think sighs

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:14,510
with the commercial that you suffer you

00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:18,860
finger rear corner from fight online or

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:23,990
registry then there is also sometimes

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:26,410
like rain that is a big project and we

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:32,270
saying you can do everything you want

00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:35,059
then also there are some times where we

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,879
work it well

00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:42,350
opportunity to work in saw certify like

00:25:37,879 --> 00:25:46,519
and the ground like reported and the job

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:49,549
sitting guy is a very powerful and we by

00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:53,289
side in berkeley whether people p decide

00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:57,320
and so with x technology you can

00:25:53,289 --> 00:26:02,389
implement this router in your kid that

00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:06,110
is called Aurora and and so with a

00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:12,440
cookie repeat you can create are also

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:20,029
like a spider to describing this is the

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:26,860
best level or describing for new site

00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:34,539
and then there is also 5 we're here that

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:42,190
i remember that using firefox engine

00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:42,190
there is another one that is extrude on

00:26:48,400 --> 00:27:00,100
co-op who is using a su Rana tarana is

00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:04,780
about a modular suite and he tried to

00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:10,820
using something from 50 slaughtered and

00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:18,559
so you have the same gene for HTML

00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:23,179
grades in JavaScript if you are from

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:29,720
Java water HTML you it is about one

00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:32,950
because if you are if you had a deuce

00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:37,100
some scrubbing with Jarrah and I

00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:42,860
mutation yes you will do the same point

00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:47,030
language but is female unit you have to

00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:50,150
run asada so you have server running on

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:54,559
your graphic and angle task was manually

00:27:50,150 --> 00:28:00,110
go with library so it's not very little

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:05,120
for a skewer organization and then if

00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:08,330
you want simple to some more simpler and

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,960
technique beautiful shop is the best

00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:16,100
because because of the static web page

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:24,710
you have to get all things in a very

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:29,179
easy way the other one I used a decent

00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:33,760
hell because we tell is an end it is not

00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:39,880
bite of you deposit on a user my lyrics

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:43,550
sot where the best performance in a

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:49,760
reading despite all the work you want

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:53,460
from the xml page and so you have to use

00:28:49,760 --> 00:29:00,330
a spotter so you can sure

00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:03,390
your cement base cost and you can have

00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:08,240
some anchor so you can change on the

00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:12,120
floor I xml-based work on with other

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:15,480
because all DOMA is spiritual decline

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:20,750
and change or land in the development

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:26,960
and we create a new document they were

00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:29,669
and this is the best I think so

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:34,490
beautiful so hopefully you start comes

00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:38,850
with static page and foremost cherie

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:41,779
started with dynamic web page is very

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:41,779
stressed

00:29:52,179 --> 00:30:00,610
sasson work Marcia best has pages to be

00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:06,429
alone that's called chicken juice from

00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:11,649
MIT that's maybe a little like I am but

00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:16,019
much much more actually just a small

00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:19,029
editor for cows trips inside and low

00:30:16,019 --> 00:30:26,169
status we know where to see what does

00:30:19,029 --> 00:30:31,360
and it also made taps and execute chance

00:30:26,169 --> 00:30:34,320
to come web pages and I think also use

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,320
these monitors

00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:52,450
yeah your library buttocks and I think

00:30:46,790 --> 00:31:01,610
says working because Jamie's listen but

00:30:52,450 --> 00:31:09,500
not the same and extend much more I know

00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:18,560
I at least the BBS want to there are a

00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:26,600
lot of yay wait Sam luminant 0 and

00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:29,030
negative charges I'm suggest one one way

00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:31,910
to use it for probably be too i can use

00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:34,580
without my phone this article one

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:37,940
wanting to use it could be that if you

00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:42,500
have a page and you want to earn revenue

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:46,160
you could find some advertised in the

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:49,360
local area advertise similar things you

00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,360
could simply found them

00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:26,830
yeah it's a good idea but I selected a

00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:30,350
typical and we could sign to using a to

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:34,120
do occasion to try to give information

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:40,220
about acquisition from getting you

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:54,760
bathtubs you want to make you a little

00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:59,899
more but we decided as some Sun face

00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:03,080
they are formed and then I clothing yeah

00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:06,200
but usually the companies that emphasize

00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:08,750
they will have a foreign language yank

00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:12,309
and call them and ask that you want to

00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:17,769
advertise my homepage to because I i

00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:17,769
right about the horses and riding hood

00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,980
