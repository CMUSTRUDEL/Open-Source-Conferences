okay great okay everybody today I'm

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,770
going to give you an interruption App

00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:12,360
Engine this is a story that may have two

00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:15,059
different endings and I'm not sure which

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,830
any more than bootay so either we're

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,539
going to do an example where I'll show

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,960
you how to create an app engine app

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,970
maybe I should plug in or I will tell

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,130
you about other cloud other google cloud

00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:32,070
products besides happen Abaddon is only

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,660
one google pal powder so all you guys

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,110
tell me what you want to see towards the

00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:41,430
end okay so I message on the Gulf Arab

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,960
get a google you can get the web page

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,740
for App Engine it's little one right

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,750
below and then you can contact me in my

00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:58,350
Twitter or you can also follow the App

00:00:48,750 --> 00:01:03,530
Engine team Twitter ok so if go to

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,530
google appengine I it has changed

00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,430
um

00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:14,250
okay so about me this is just a lot of

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,720
descriptions too important most

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,580
important thing about me if you haven't

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,390
already comprised office earlier is that

00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:25,920
I have to teach so I companies they give

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:29,760
you pause the conference's i right so i

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,190
have a google seen before most important

00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:35,550
thing is echoed so i worked at all these

00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,470
different companies before working on

00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:41,250
full time as a soccer here for the last

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,070
14 years you can hang on well are so

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,740
easy to do as you find job as a primary

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,660
softer in here where the main tool that

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,100
you use the fat that's been kind of

00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:55,410
tricky know even though it was so so

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,320
some work to do for backup to sort of

00:01:55,410 --> 00:02:00,060
catch up on Long angsting so the first

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,800
I'm going to do is before I talk about

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,700
what happen janiers some want to talk

00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:09,300
about local communities besides going to

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,489
be a buzzword compliant so most of you

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,380
go to English then is to talking about

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,380
we're averaging distant to a picture

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,480
this is a system google is sponsoring

00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,480
the conference you guys

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,099
will you go about something so he go

00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:33,099
somewhere don't get something from

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,280
so I want you to be aware that there is

00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:42,650
there are google user groups all around

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,820
the world there are longing parents as

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,530
well so as you want to be able to talk

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,150
but wherever you are from there is

00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,070
probably a Google technology use brute

00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:54,320
nearby so I have one of those cigarettes

00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,060
agent remember it via the place that you

00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,960
can go a little bit all us was the g

00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,200
Google technologies gasps and grab the

00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,200
scissors

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:12,819
just a going to pass on state people

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:18,319
every other one ok pick one yeah

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:21,290
whatever one you want all right so what

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,020
is a competing basically so here's a

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,250
more official definition of computing

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,239
from the national institute of standards

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:31,370
and technology at the come up with about

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,170
a year ago a little over a year oh so

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:39,530
it's a very formal definition is correct

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:42,680
but it complicated actually been around

00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:47,060
for even longer okay so a long time ago

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,459
in 1984 sun microsystems had the company

00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,010
slogan must be network is the computer

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,560
okay so you know they had already been

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,989
thinking as long as you have connection

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,470
to the network we have the machine that

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:03,170
do all the work now the one thing that

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:07,760
made it so it was not possible at the

00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:10,280
time was because machines do not reach

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,010
the commodity pricing stage yet right

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,640
sun microsystems machines as well so

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:20,540
sorry I HB deck they're all very

00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:23,270
expensive so so that's why I like you

00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,540
know between you do not take off that at

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:29,860
that time hitting

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,780
as inexpensive as they are now so how

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,940
competing sort of you know came into

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,770
really strong focus in life 2004-2005

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:42,460
alvin amazon came up with depends on my

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:44,800
services everybody know ec2 s3 ok and

00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,250
the main reason is because amazon over

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,350
all this time in their entire existence

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,710
has built up enough you know they have

00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,890
very large data centers and you have

00:04:53,710 --> 00:05:00,700
many many machines lost Harbor lots of

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,850
disk in order for them to survive the

00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,380
day after american thanks to you right

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,900
so you know that is like the biggest

00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,270
shopping day of the year so you have all

00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,670
these machines so that you know they can

00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,070
take all these for the holiday gift

00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:21,340
orders right where are all those

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:25,390
machines doing in july not much take up

00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:30,040
electricity so they wanted to try to

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:33,370
recover some of the money by subleasing

00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,500
their computing power to everybody okay

00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,920
and that's why that's how sore my

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:43,060
service or really started the whole you

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,970
know let's make commercialize up and so

00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,490
and then large companies followed after

00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:51,060
that that had a lot of resources matters

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:54,240
on google

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,150
force as a lot of parties have expand

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,810
hey what I think we could turn computing

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:04,380
into a utility like your power and your

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:07,560
water and your as you see here natural

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:11,550
gas at home so I'll computing is making

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,320
computing utility okay of course there's

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:16,740
no people always talk about benefit at

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:20,700
all you know you can even grow shrink as

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:23,910
needed inger automated so that all these

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:27,440
good things about pop from you I don't

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:31,350
have to go but it is more marketing

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,360
interesting the plane is my next year

00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,800
one-fifth of the largest to other

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,660
companies in the world will be using

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
some sort of public cloud services

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,400
whereas you know two years ago it was

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,740
only it was less than five percent so

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,220
about computing is happening regardless

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,790
of control

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,700
so I went to a very interesting talk

00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:57,110
given by the chairman of semantics John

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:59,870
Thompson and he said that you just

00:06:57,110 --> 00:07:02,090
should not fight it ok now it's probably

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:03,620
not a good idea if he's in Jose tomorrow

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,200
it will switch everything to the cloud

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:09,410
computing I'll be not a good idea you

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,140
can't do it all day so they suggest that

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,870
you as a company you slowly start

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,120
migrating eventually everything's gonna

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,760
change anyway everything's going up

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,390
anyway they might as well start now the

00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,310
started with a smaller systems are not

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,720
as critical that you can sort of have a

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,390
little bit of downtown or whatever

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,190
that's it so transition over so don't

00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:34,970
you ever know a long time is a

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:37,820
suggestion okay so there's three

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,480
different levels of upgrading I'll

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:43,610
describe to you what they are so at the

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,060
first level we have the highest level

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:52,130
you have SaaS which stands for software

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:56,990
as a service and so in software as a

00:07:52,130 --> 00:08:00,110
service this means that whatever

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,080
software you use everything is online

00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:05,000
you can only access is software for a

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,160
web browser there's nowhere else for you

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,729
to get it so an example that would be

00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,800
female got email sales force than that

00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:15,140
you have to have web browser you is a

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,330
piece of software that only exists on

00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:20,530
the internet

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:22,800
pc or anything else ok so there's either

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:28,240
of examples of software-as-a-service

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,389
everything is full of plural vendors at

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,630
the very bottom is IAS which is

00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,510
infrastructure as a service and that is

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,550
where we have the familiar amazon in

00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,219
those all those services all right so

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:44,800
you're renting sheen do you know your

00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:48,779
ranking disk so they give you they give

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:52,180
you a hardware they give us should see a

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,980
networking and cooling that's all you

00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,370
get everything else about that is your

00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,420
responsibility databases operating

00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:03,550
system web server load balancing

00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:05,980
monitoring reporting when all of those

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,750
things you responsible for whereas at

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:12,430
the software service there you won't do

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:14,440
anything except login ok yeah along that

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,779
nobody really talks about as much as

00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,320
everybody knows about officer everybody

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:22,120
has your gmail hotmail email whatever

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,920
and everybody does audience or services

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,649
because you want to read something great

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,500
they had early after are very much his

00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:32,110
platform as a service but to me it's the

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,930
most powerful at all you know regardless

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,560
of you know that could work or we have

00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:41,380
in a team and ignore that right ah it's

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,140
not a by is actually true the reason is

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,360
because platform as a service gives you

00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,070
everything that you don't get with the

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,170
infrastructure as a service it doesn't

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,350
have a new your application necessarily

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:55,959
right i can write an application but

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,870
separate from that is oh it should i

00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:01,660
used can i use what web service Reggie

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,480
what operating system should i use can i

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,730
use ok those things are taken care of

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,710
automatic whereas the infrastructure i

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:11,980
have to worry at all that stuff too in

00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:15,870
addition to my appt at the platform

00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:18,820
layer the other guys were about is a nap

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,070
ok and i upload it to whichever company

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,640
is here Microsoft or Google doesn't

00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,950
really matter I'll put it and they write

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,779
it for me on the same machine that I

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:30,910
brought the rest of their company ok

00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,279
anyway I'll know that Google has spent a

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,920
lot of money buying machines and

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,279
building up our ears that are around the

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,410
world to make ours is available it has

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,360
to be right because my google we think

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,460
of scale is it something a Google scale

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,070
is the phrase bees inside the building

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,040
because it has to be very big how many

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:54,610
people have gone to you calm and about

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,490
500 before right you guys ever out in

00:10:54,610 --> 00:11:00,970
here a google search page you may have

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,070
months long as you never have it because

00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:06,279
the company goal is never have bad

00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:08,709
service ever so they have paid a lot of

00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,209
smart people to actually build this

00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,279
whole day so what did you lock your

00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:15,279
application to run the same systems to

00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:18,520
that's really the value add and I've a

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,610
platform and you use platform as a

00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:24,430
service to write software service

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:26,950
applications because once you write it

00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:30,339
those applications down different cloud

00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,750
and so they in fact so your users don't

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,670
have to worry about anything else

00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,620
set for creating a login or have

00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,650
identification or authorization to the

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:41,800
data okay so it gives you everything

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:46,850
that infrastructures does not have and

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:48,920
order to build SAS applications that's

00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,760
why I think it falls hard because it's

00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:55,010
random between vocals ok so this app

00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,530
engine app engine is where you create

00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:02,090
your app you upload it to Google and any

00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:05,600
NASA screamo browser or where you are

00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:07,550
both have application because you will

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,930
suffer develop and it will get so if you

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:11,450
can actually excessive locally before

00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,720
uploading live and once you do upload it

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:18,130
live to to Google into the cloud your ad

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:22,670
is instantly available around the world

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:26,240
free mostly except for China or we might

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:29,570
be locked that's not our our proposed

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,240
the government so issues to do that and

00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,400
these rotating Boston IP addresses so

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,230
some dr. Abbas long-term stress has to

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,870
stop

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:41,690
get onto that and also out of here

00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:46,640
official leader so a very difficult for

00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:48,470
tank op de ver very persistent and those

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,620
times I always get around the government

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,660
because that's what people do he has

00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:59,660
this evening at your expressed by your

00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:02,660
government to so anyway so the main idea

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,800
about having a good platform is that you

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:09,950
don't have to worry about any of these

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:12,050
things all separated at heart okay you

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:17,060
know we gave me the machines either day

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:20,090
today's little bouncers first you have

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:23,830
to tell appear on users you know we have

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:27,620
web server database server logs

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:29,240
reporting versioning Otto during all

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,520
those things Google using for free

00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:33,410
because these things don't really like i

00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,939
said earlier don't have much to her

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,579
house

00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:38,709
what is called cross functionality it is

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:41,859
a nice it on top of you in your opposite

00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:49,089
elbow but it's not exactly a trap Alaska

00:13:41,859 --> 00:13:51,939
facility in your app is so you try to

00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:55,629
tell if you do it yourself ukyo stood

00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:57,399
yourself the other costume so for

00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:59,199
example I'll tell you like Amazon they

00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,449
have a lot of hardware that's not do

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,459
anything in the middle year they just

00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:06,189
have machines to help you survive the

00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:07,949
bait shop units you have to work you

00:14:06,189 --> 00:14:11,379
know if you have infrastructure to

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:13,929
co-operate nice offer you know packing a

00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:16,959
caliber that sooner or later you got my

00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:19,209
people help a that sooner or later or

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,939
maybe once way for my sequel to

00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:23,769
something like knowledge like mama de or

00:14:21,939 --> 00:14:26,559
senator or something like that you have

00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:30,129
to go all that work okay baby eels

00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:32,169
databases unless he may have a lot of

00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:34,629
maintenance you have to wear a ver you

00:14:32,169 --> 00:14:35,949
have to monitor your traffic and see

00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,789
whether or not people have enough

00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:41,109
capacity you know I launching serves

00:14:38,789 --> 00:14:43,299
portrait of i-5 service there's a big

00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:44,679
difference in cost if you're a small

00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,929
company that doesn't have a lot of money

00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,419
buying 20 surgery which do out a

00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:51,159
business but it's also possible that if

00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:53,289
you don't have own machines you also go

00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:56,379
to business people you can load because

00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:58,179
somebody's to you or slap shot right so

00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:00,159
very hard figure out how much you need

00:14:58,179 --> 00:15:03,009
and I guess one of the most expensive

00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,299
things that that the average and other

00:15:03,009 --> 00:15:07,329
platforms kind of gave you the

00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:09,139
scalability to build that is very very

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:13,519
hard we have

00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:15,350
15 years and even then took up several

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,339
years I have to build a petition for us

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:23,480
are in a forest operating goes along

00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:26,899
with ashes so this is the markings like

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,669
in a marketing sites google said well

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:32,600
we'll give you anything inside one talks

00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:34,999
were arrested he's easy to start because

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,249
we these free applications that you to

00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:40,459
try it out leaves three quota so they

00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:46,429
try it out and he thinks is right yes

00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:48,290
find and use it very often and only if

00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:51,199
you receive the people that we have to

00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,299
charge you money if you if you have said

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:57,049
it had a lot of traffic give me a much

00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:59,449
at all a very economical easily started

00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:04,100
that way easy to scale means you don't

00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:07,189
have to do in at all in a drawer be

00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,749
brain that is something wrong it was not

00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:10,309
a lot of traffic there were one

00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:15,139
application developer he was coming

00:16:10,309 --> 00:16:17,389
sorry so that you know one day the

00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:20,449
famous actress did need more about an ox

00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:22,759
app and she feed about it and is it

00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:25,730
ain't no 14 million people try to access

00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:28,910
is their app okay you know that until

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,339
he's checking their gloves did I say the

00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:33,199
service everyone down they had a lot of

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:34,970
time you can see it on the graph just

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,889
went up way high and then go back and

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,559
out and all other people tell is just

00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,119
cool so you never lonely these things

00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:43,069
are going to happen but they didn't know

00:16:41,119 --> 00:16:44,899
about it and I mustn't worry about it

00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,730
right that's the developer that's the

00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:49,610
one thing you do have to think about ok

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,100
and then easy to maintain so of course

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,049
you know evidently doesn't to we're not

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,480
source code repository for your

00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:59,240
application but we do save versions of

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,490
your out for you so no

00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,740
once you rang a live production you know

00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,410
you have everything in your universe so

00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:10,010
like it or in material you have let

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:13,100
every cabin and then maybe you know II

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:15,170
lasater you have no virgin shoot so you

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,030
think I source code you also upload that

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,160
the advent but they need to start all

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:21,620
those really bad Vulcans I really want

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,569
to go back okay so you don't have to go

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,600
and back to your source code control

00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:29,540
system go every single file it was

00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,700
Yvonne and I hope that my repository was

00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,590
correct you know I hold my testes tell

00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,020
me it's correct and I'm in a real boat

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:40,010
if you all have to do that that isn't

00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:42,260
automatically saves the 1010 version of

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,910
the standards of your app so you can say

00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:45,770
with a political about you say you know

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,590
I don't want to meet you I just want to

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:51,080
select a one and then rode out when you

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,360
can do that from the control panel okay

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,770
but you know of course it's good idea to

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,800
have original troll but that hasn't

00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:59,390
really perhaps off the purposes okay so

00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,320
we're looking to that city to maintain

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:05,840
your application i have 52 so in other

00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,179
words engineers at Google do all the

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,280
dirty work for you and you don't have

00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:12,740
little haters because we have those for

00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,050
you alright so we go vertical something

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,720
wrong with the system as any time you

00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:19,670
guys are probably drive engine up by the

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,040
time you have your problem somebody

00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,399
already knows about it at Google because

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,889
we happy

00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:30,359
around the block washing system actually

00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:34,649
the matter how genes even contacted if

00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:36,570
necessary okay so you don't have to get

00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:41,789
I keeper so basically if you are very

00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:42,599
small company we are your IT team all

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:45,719
right so let's talk about other

00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:47,519
components so ya know what the system is

00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:50,190
right so there's four major parts

00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,659
rapidly we have landed on top switch is

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,219
what are the languages that you can use

00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:55,799
to write your application for the team

00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:57,769
to the library to a beeline we have a

00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:00,929
web-based administration console view

00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:02,820
the site we have the sale of fish up to

00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:06,320
the hitch earlier and it's a software

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,940
development kit please do your absolute

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,479
okay so the thing that you have no

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:14,179
control over is the scale infrastructure

00:19:11,479 --> 00:19:17,399
and it isn't all her Google's Nicole

00:19:14,179 --> 00:19:19,259
okay you know where your machines are

00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:21,779
you know what kind of cheese do you know

00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:23,899
what kind of operate that it's some sort

00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:23,899
of

00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:30,869
Google filesystems primary file system

00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:35,970
is our expedited partner and we're going

00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:38,429
to be table which is on religious or our

00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:41,869
paper was written in 2016 have to look

00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:46,619
up at details of how deep it was

00:19:41,869 --> 00:19:53,340
previously laughter chiara google da

00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:57,320
system we had a homemade everything just

00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:59,820
because you think we should carefully

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,519
they were lost our people our

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:04,679
researchers or graduate students

00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,320
graduated trainer research toward right

00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:11,659
working a google is like working you

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:11,659
like like like postgraduate school

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:17,730
halloween her net you know give you food

00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:21,210
and they they fought hard you want me

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:29,359
there exercise rooms so really is like

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:29,359
being in Eddie's really matter as well

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,580
so it must resemble

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:42,470
yes

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,470
it not

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,730
so

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,720
language runtime so you support free

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,110
programming languages at this time you

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:59,280
can use right application with three our

00:20:55,110 --> 00:21:00,960
Python Java and grow and because we have

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,880
to support java you have a bunch of

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,710
alternative and i'll show you a little

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,140
bit later but even shows because they

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,390
were computer batteries included also

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,860
still very new but a patent Addabbo

00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,590
certainly the super batteries included

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:19,520
because they pretty much glued

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:23,130
everything need to get started with that

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:30,990
which function part Jesus I comfortable

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:32,610
thought so pretty popular Lee's house or

00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:36,500
holes were actually working on to us

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,500
it's getting over 26

00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:46,490
they're soldiers a psalm in the market

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,049
demand they will be sources on there

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,140
anything in a few has a passion about

00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:54,500
you sure well because the STK the PI SDK

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,559
is almost certainly open to the energy

00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:03,679
charter you didn't go and sit for he

00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:06,080
threw us as well as well so one of the

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,260
most highly highly requested items as ph

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,919
e but we sort of existing that right now

00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:18,049
but there is a lot of market and so is

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:20,419
akin Colonel valor kg so there is

00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:22,340
alternative but the attorneys top not

00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:25,010
what PHP programmers are really excited

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:28,429
about so but I thought about that whole

00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:33,140
area so creating languages for an hour

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:35,059
at Java go and go actually the Dover

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,220
just came out of you I don't last month

00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:41,510
so it's very very nude but there you

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:46,160
have it several hundred house already so

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:50,780
yeah we'll see if it slide this is three

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:54,170
before and after on its outside you see

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:57,380
that so forth so the path was chosen up

00:22:54,170 --> 00:23:01,880
just because we were surrounded the team

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:05,810
and I suppose this but a panel was very

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,670
first one time for a tension and reason

00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:10,490
why I was chosen it was because you can

00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,710
develop very fast in addition tell you

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:14,720
all this together you know right very

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:17,300
little barrier you know happy computers

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:21,080
nice teenager to use that it awesome

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:25,250
attitude robotics library of actors and

00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:27,650
models so very routine guy and added in

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:34,430
april two thousand eight so it's three

00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:37,820
years old huh java stood up ok so we're

00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:40,190
tight on with the ease of use so job is

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,900
everyone enterprise so you learn

00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,630
eventually we really got that supporting

00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:47,090
a ceases very close needs to the job

00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:49,250
service and is much as possible again

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:52,760
it's also understand or a package to

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:55,000
models and we also have a special custom

00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,890
eclipse august so you are first user

00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:01,340
then we have several tools that plugin

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:06,290
that help you at invest MGMT web toolkit

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:08,150
a suit for alternative IE ESO para java

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:12,190
programmer you don't you love how easy

00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:14,679
or net easter sunday and there's also

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,470
there's also happen to support them stew

00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:19,899
is this not from google company from the

00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:23,250
vendors that may goes to add east but

00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:27,370
this plugin for Eclipse / dat my google

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:29,350
and again alternative practices okay so

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,450
go along i said it's sort of the

00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:33,519
combination of highland job it gives you

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,870
sad and type language that people want

00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:39,490
so much but it as simple syntax kind of

00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:42,669
emotional about right in between without

00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:45,879
the posse arabsat exact language but

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:49,419
it's at its sort of ease of use of the

00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:51,220
empty language to the slaughter if you

00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:53,139
can never play with go before you might

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,370
want to give it a shot if I average in

00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:59,590
to do it mystified case alright so act

00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,659
Java so without any earlier that we try

00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:04,690
to stick very close to john sanders all

00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:07,000
these jazz ours sure if you know how to

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,460
write serve it creates serve it out then

00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,990
you have let happen very soon to that

00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:16,000
you notice a way back xml is also added

00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:19,029
it smell if you're familiar with using

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,870
GAO VA PA you use those tools or

00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:26,390
operation editors there's a lower level

00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:28,490
objectify that you don't like doing

00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:32,060
a little level and have it work a little

00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:33,560
bit faster God objectify or you sit

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:35,750
about that I just want to use the

00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:39,590
low-level gay story and you want to do

00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:41,750
that as well there you are a legend

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:45,650
Dolly Parton's that I can follow the

00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:47,540
same process to try to map everything

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:48,860
else is awful so whatever your mirror

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,030
will give it up with something really

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:55,250
different and also a tasting is reported

00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,170
as well this is a gradual standard it if

00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:59,180
you said that it's not working for you

00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,340
you know at least you know that you know

00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:03,790
JT of the APA outside of that would say

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:07,190
it goes for you don't get any URLs and

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:10,400
emailing and then you know else are and

00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,580
try not to lock you in but the plugin

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,100
for Eclipse see it's very horsey but the

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:19,250
most important a car here's the google

00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,810
absolutely love it slacker she attacked

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,040
your shoes whether you want added

00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:27,440
support active for your project or not

00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:32,030
and then you get you know behavior code

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:35,600
managers hablo de Graaff okay it had

00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:38,030
arrested on the server that users we

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:41,420
have something possibly a little Slayer

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:43,370
so on internet patent java and go with a

00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,639
pregame languages by now that we have a

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:49,139
JDM y axis or otherwise

00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:52,929
written on top of the again so sala Ruby

00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:56,409
movie or Ruby so here's the alternative

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:59,469
HP this is Fergus which is PHP writing

00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:02,649
top of the GM the very first approach is

00:26:59,469 --> 00:27:04,839
like BP language the acidic as you can

00:27:02,649 --> 00:27:07,209
just grow I'm sure sequel their utmost

00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:09,999
be cheaper and dude you have to sit

00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:12,909
upright ESG a theory you know little

00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:16,239
discs or so that is very different at

00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:18,459
BPS not used to so thought you suffering

00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:23,139
a series to perform the faculty were

00:27:18,459 --> 00:27:25,839
very good a PhD am a very fine too it's

00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:30,820
just that your experience writing a PhD

00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:32,820
at Singh also run a dog treats you right

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:36,879
up and of course all sitting right on

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,979
running attack on a picture as well and

00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:42,369
all of the more recent journals such as

00:27:38,979 --> 00:27:44,529
an example of any type automatic so it's

00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:47,889
a lot of you get asking well why would i

00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:50,259
want to write and have it run right just

00:27:47,889 --> 00:27:51,969
really pure python all the maybes enough

00:27:50,259 --> 00:27:54,450
without of course is you know you're

00:27:51,969 --> 00:27:57,429
coming too because many years it'll help

00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,259
settle Java packages library you don't

00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:00,999
lose all that or you want to quarrel

00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:03,450
that over right some of your new

00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:06,429
properties using Python obviously i

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,709
instantiate possible all the java

00:28:06,429 --> 00:28:12,219
positive and we'll just work with each

00:28:08,709 --> 00:28:13,059
other so as we had blue hassle-free haha

00:28:12,219 --> 00:28:15,399
below and

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:18,429
gather and so that's the new skates I

00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:19,960
icon this particular case all right so

00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:22,330
it's also what is that integration

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:24,399
console use it for every app that you

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:27,480
have and we try to give you some data on

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:30,190
your applications so one of the things

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,049
people know states that a bad news or

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:34,179
the downside of using cloud computing

00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:36,519
system is that you lose control out

00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:38,440
something to be I don't have the rec

00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:41,379
access my love I don't have direct

00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,289
access to recording system that i want

00:28:41,379 --> 00:28:46,509
to write for my tool to analyze to the

00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:49,809
performance of my adam its users from

00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:52,179
how all this is going so because of that

00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:54,039
google is getting you as well basically

00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:56,379
impossible to kind of make up for that

00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:58,929
you'll have it we try to keep as much

00:28:56,379 --> 00:29:02,200
data about your app as possible that

00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:03,610
your name is okay so that you don't have

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,679
to be able to be able to give it to you

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:09,159
so we show you how much traffic you what

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,950
happens okay so you can see the SAT

00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:14,980
words of two years old so you have a lot

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:17,799
more data now we're outta here this is

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:20,470
you to do a basic idea of loyalty pass

00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:26,350
okay see how the traffic graph show you

00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:28,929
know from now and up to 30 days what you

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:31,179
know what would your topic pattern that

00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:32,769
you see there i think a lot of funny and

00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:35,350
then the ending is pure out of spikes

00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:40,090
also off so this seller is all point

00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:43,690
five five requests per second but eating

00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:45,850
so that's a half happy about to say it

00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,559
more well request every other second so

00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:49,779
getting a little bit about it right

00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:50,919
every other day or some other browsers

00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:53,440
in your apps are you getting a little

00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:55,570
for the project is also telling you

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,309
about your usage in your building so

00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,919
there's a little market shows you where

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:02,139
your people is any and whether you've

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,800
exceeded I've already asked it tells you

00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:05,900
what your overall it is

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,450
you so far whatever your budget is and

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,870
how much it's costing you so far is the

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:14,210
cpu for bandwidth or email because I

00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,700
that is a sash compare and see on the

00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,530
top edition which you are I just making

00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,330
me compares and we'll just percent

00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:22,640
overall of all your ears what is the

00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,820
current oh that you're experiencing I

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,980
just want to throw it out for her bippy

00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:29,600
it tells you like what what your cheek

00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:32,150
you you're using it over here you can

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,890
see inside an atom or about I can get

00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:37,190
more details about my toga I can get

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:40,070
access to logs from my app I can take a

00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,650
look at my tias or in disease I browse

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,970
today that I have about a store can you

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,920
settings I can control who the

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:48,530
developers or if I a pike an advantage

00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:50,750
of the versions I can control that bill

00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,520
essays and get the documentation system

00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,020
size all these things that we gave you

00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:57,860
this tool so that you don't have to

00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:00,680
build it yourself okay and then we also

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:03,140
have this overall system status okay so

00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:07,760
you know it's not always green like this

00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:10,010
message I look great you're not i mean

00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,970
cloud computing systems not immune

00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:16,310
issues but the thing is a lot of times

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:18,350
people people see people are

00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:21,380
experiencing problems with app but the

00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:23,290
hood assistance shrp ingredients or the

00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,570
wonder why is that

00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,490
well things this thing is not from your

00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,040
app this seems from the entire system

00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:32,500
overall so even if your app is being

00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,360
naughty you know some problems not all

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,010
after having tried so it's only because

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,110
the general problem or it's affecting

00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:40,390
you know a lot more than just your app

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,160
that have to show up and like I said

00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:44,320
earlier by the time something actually

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:47,830
shows up here somebody already knows

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,650
about it thank you so you're inviting

00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:53,080
any situation than just a you know file

00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,520
is dating somebody go go go alright I

00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:58,030
will probably just tell you that

00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,520
somebody already fixing it all right so

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:03,130
anyway that's how about yes ok so the

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,320
SDK comes to the development server so

00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:07,690
you can try locally for your uploaded

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,740
magic reduction very easy to deploy all

00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:15,580
you need is your credentials I do I or

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:21,070
use command line and ashford is Leah CA

00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:23,560
and i'll see you at eight Gus alright so

00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:26,179
i'll talk more about the AP is

00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:28,249
momentarily but for now

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:31,220
about what's happening users that we

00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:34,610
have just an idea who uses App Engine

00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:36,110
and what's the other number sorry so App

00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:39,919
Engine actually has been growing very

00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:43,039
steadily since the original which is the

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,279
original wash so we've been around for

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,549
three years now and usage actions taking

00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:51,379
off significant to the point where you

00:32:49,549 --> 00:32:56,240
made this announcement Google i/o last

00:32:51,379 --> 00:32:58,789
month and that is that Google has put

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,429
their their game behind the product and

00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:03,559
you're coming out a preview of to become

00:33:01,429 --> 00:33:06,769
an official product now it will not be

00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:08,470
canceled all right unlike other Google

00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:10,750
products on for tonight

00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:12,789
it just happens to private I the ad

00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,830
agency didn't decide about either not

00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:18,600
because so it will come up preview no

00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:23,020
any kind of visually supportive product

00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:25,630
which is good news the reason why what

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:27,700
kind of broke that we had first of all

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,620
there's more than 100,000 after

00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,850
developers per month active means

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,760
they're actually using it you're

00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:39,750
uploading versions using the product to

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:43,270
develop upon so 100,000 but every month

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,669
there are more than 200,000 active ask

00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:47,289
every week that means in practice so you

00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:51,760
guys can all go back to your government

00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:55,360

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,059
any traffic right so removing all those

00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,159
apps that are getting traffic every day

00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:01,480
there's more than 200,000 actually these

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,460
numbers and giving you a very

00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,650
conservative the actual numbers are a

00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,690
lot higher over now ready to make those

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:09,820
numbers public it the beast hunters who

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,260
can make public it's all you need to

00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,540
know that these more than whatever

00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,520
numbers i have here acted apps there's

00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,220
more than 100

00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:21,190
developer the more than 200,000 us every

00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:23,440
week and if I was to take every single

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:27,010
app engine app and put it together how

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:34,929
many pages we have a okay anybody wanna

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:37,960
take a guess how many pages Eddie it's

00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:41,320
1.5 billion eight years to do it but it

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,960
was ok let's go yeah it's a kind of

00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,210
shopping so for a while we were under

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,330
the radar and as soon as we went over 1

00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:52,929
billion pages a day a senior VP found us

00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:55,060
because it is not a billion then it's

00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:58,060
it's not google scale who won't notice

00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,490
but what about over again we got a visit

00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:05,680
from the senior VP protestant drinks and

00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:07,869
eats sweets ok very it's a pretty big

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,650
number against it's all obstacles

00:35:07,869 --> 00:35:14,109
together and I individual Lots so who

00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:15,700
are some of our developers so these are

00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:20,050
some well-known company that you sent in

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:22,030
of course you know ebay and the American

00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:24,790
shocking company that's why don't run

00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,830
their entire company off pathogen but

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,200
they do run certain parts were coming

00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:31,570
off that same goes for another piece

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,599
listen here evite if you have reason

00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,099
before call to the party they also run

00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,460
at least ten percent of the topic

00:35:36,099 --> 00:35:41,500
throughout fiction okay PAGASA ladies

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:44,260
companies in particular used to overhear

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:47,700
about eco Canadian there are interesting

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:50,680
scale cases I do that you should give up

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:52,750
so many folk is the first one so i don't

00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,730
know if you guys use facebook or not but

00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,619
you know there's a possible poking or

00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,530
writing what poking is where you poke

00:35:56,619 --> 00:36:01,570
your friend AKA here kind of thing and

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,180
then another company called slide came

00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:06,849
up with a super poke so instead of it

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:09,730
spoken tonight you can like throw sheep

00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:11,230
at them okay or people will be here or

00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,240
give a high five or something so that's

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,970
more interesting and then there's a stir

00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,900
company called bodycote okay it has a

00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:22,880
little icons

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:26,770
avatars and you can dress them and play

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,270
with them every day make them happy and

00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:33,890
there are all the social networks like

00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:36,770
Facebook MySpace or hi5 being either on

00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:39,440
every social network and giving a lot of

00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:42,590
money okay so we know that are very

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,280
successful so kind of scaling have a we

00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:49,700
were able to do a pension I skip the

00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,380
side they have more than 62 million

00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,410
register

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,330
users select until at least ccc million

00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,300
rows in a database or actually

00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:02,770
optimistic views froze relational

00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:04,600
database right so see some more than 64

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:07,030
million register view the top in fact a

00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,160
few months ago ok so that's a lot of

00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:12,040
users now registered users without

00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,530
having an app is that app active so the

00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:16,180
normal number is how many these users

00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:19,360
are actually common playing with a

00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,700
little friend every day ok facebook

00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,920
there are three point six million daily

00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,260
active users daily happy it means they

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,480
can check her out everyday on myspace

00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,040
there was one point nine active users

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,990
all hit or at least five and half

00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,600
million people kind of play with a

00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,280
little friend every day ok and you're

00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,640
making money and I don't even found the

00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:44,340
other social network of the wrong

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:46,360
question yes they are because they

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:48,310
launched really good day right after

00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,920
African came on and the job of reporting

00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:53,650
us are 41 years so he denounced the jobs

00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,300
or at the one year anniversary and in

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:58,590
the go else became a three-year

00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,910
anniversary yes they are you can pack up

00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:05,320
this let's go back to a couple more

00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:08,740
house so enterprise loose enterprise

00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:10,600
apps ok so this web files of these very

00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:13,630
very interesting company so if you're

00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,180
familiar with American soft fading rules

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,970
you know

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,860
through America America has the SEC or

00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:20,990
securities and exchange commission that

00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,580
monitors you so if you are a public

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,080
company very big company you have to

00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,420
report all of your earnings numbers

00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:29,240
right and so doing all that people in

00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,310
Philip s3 form you have you know your

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,350
quarterly earnings your annual earnings

00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:36,290
and all that paperwork it is very

00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:38,510
non-technical okay it's all like numbers

00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:40,370
and search to the following companies or

00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:43,340
the products are so the very boring

00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:45,560
thing so what these guys they actually

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,510
put all these reports in the money into

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:49,610
the cloud so that all you do is you take

00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:52,010
or Excel or whatever you just dump it

00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:54,230
into this thing formats everything for

00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:57,650
you and they uploaded directly to the

00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:59,600
SEC all in the time okay so they have

00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,280
very very customers these are very big

00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,770
things to go there all public companies

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,790
right so they are an enterprise-level

00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:09,890
company and so this is the indication

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:13,250
that you can use that in for Annalise

00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:16,580
scale apps another thing which I be

00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:18,560
recently out of your local office the

00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,150
royal wedding website was basically

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,050
happened now we all that and stuff

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:25,760
because all these are women but there's

00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:29,510
some mentioning of you

00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:32,360
okay so on the day of the way they

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:34,880
actually their app had over 2,000

00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:36,320
requests per second okay so back up in

00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,000
earlier side where should the admin

00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:42,490
console member how that I'm saying like

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:47,170
25 requests per second okay so this is

00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:51,050
2000 web browsers aims at every second

00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:53,260
okay there were 15 min 80s and five and

00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:58,220
five or six million visitors that day

00:39:53,260 --> 00:40:02,090
now this is just their blog there live

00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:05,420
streaming out had a much large metal I

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,760
can't tell you yet we'll see we made

00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,410
that number public but it is much larger

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,780
than this number that are going to watch

00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:13,780
TV right and of course in America they

00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:22,730
oh my god site talk to Walter that was

00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:25,760
at elbows to that I mean it was

00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:27,890
everything right both classy any but

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,490
they use a nap nap without a post to

00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:33,170
think so it's serve on the static

00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,180
content they was like it was a much

00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:39,020
larger number less just stays over five

00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,960
digits years hey diabetes requests per

00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:43,500
second

00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,619
this half every second okay now think

00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:48,359
about how you build that into your app

00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:50,010
ok so that's one of the main reason why

00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,170
you won't go with system i'll get it

00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:54,750
because the skin is one of the most

00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:59,089
expensive and difficult age bill and

00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:02,369
he's a is also just were gaining

00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:04,440
okay so for example i don't know he

00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:07,410
seemed that the universe game just came

00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,650
out a lot version for prom so that is

00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:16,349
actually hosted on a vision as well and

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:17,760
most other apps electrolux let's talk

00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:21,330
about the other company wanted mission

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:24,060
at cedia what they do is said hang out

00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:26,910
of this wherever they do ask for

00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,730
specific events like a sporting event

00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:32,760
that only happens once in a while by the

00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:34,800
world cup or something or if Hollywood

00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,080
one seduce sort of special commotion

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:39,570
just for their blue hears about that so

00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:42,080
he thought they make it it starts with

00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:45,810
don't try to get a lot of times they go

00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:48,240
so that's this type of scale so we

00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:51,090
already saw on the previous page when we

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,740
have to you know two thousand requests

00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,480
per second but here's an example of how

00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:57,840
that trafficking for this app God and

00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,410
we'll see 1600 requests per second but I

00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,630
think this is like it was an old boy

00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:05,580
vent or it was a president obama time

00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:08,310
all habit of it so nobody knows about

00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:11,670
india and then suddenly the news here's

00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:15,300
eisley on the television radio so then

00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:17,910
the capitals of the 400 and 800 800 for

00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:21,150
wall and in the event starts and so they

00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:24,090
bloomed with all the way up to 1400 and

00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:27,360
in a piece of 1600 and even in for about

00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:29,250
here and is he talking about now but

00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,500
these users didn't have to worry about

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:35,010
that because I didn't handle it so this

00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:37,410
is this dissipation hours so six hours

00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:41,190
three hours so in one hour you know they

00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:45,540
got from zero of the 800 requests per

00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:48,000
second absolutely okay that's my other

00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:50,490
two examples game so the other thing I

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:52,650
would say is your app does not have to

00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:54,870
be but a stop right you can be given

00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:57,510
back in for a whole lap so you have the

00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,340
same issue I'm writing a formal platform

00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:02,370
but i have a whole sit back in some

00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:05,220
where do i put myself or if i go to the

00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:06,600
cloud to do okay the reason because you

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,900
might have to have something back on

00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,760
frosty don't have a house and it kind of

00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,760
love you

00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,260
just have your website all you have to

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,740
do to be able to pop your app engine app

00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,660
is to be able to make HTTP poster yet ok

00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:22,400
welcome you to wrap it up and you do

00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,190
whatever you need to do and if you can

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,320
see me it crap on the phone this is

00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:30,830
a good place I think for likely eyesores

00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:33,770
or metals or badges or contact

00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,780
information things that you know what if

00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:38,570
somebody you know drop their phone they

00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:40,520
broken we lost we got stolen right and

00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,950
then longer I sources vary more to the

00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,990
poser challenging somebody right I would

00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:47,120
be bad experience that everything is on

00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:48,800
the phone is gone so it'd be great if

00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:50,420
you could I save it to the file

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:52,310
somewhere so that they get a new phone

00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:54,470
number you saw your app but they get it

00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:56,210
roll data back again right so this is a

00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,150
good way to help your pain your user

00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:00,820
experience much better okay get the data

00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:04,550
off of the phone as much as possible

00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:07,970
yeah on your HTTP invention in kop your

00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:09,590
attitude to have ok so again not

00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,150
everything is web-based so that's the

00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,120
most important thing on sit on this

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:15,740
slide alright so I actually talked about

00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,460
each of that in the ball what we're

00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,680
working on ok so so I got addition to

00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,740
the floor we have a contained

00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,300
environment so that you know again you

00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,220
lose a little bit of control a very

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,010
modern school you'll have a loss so

00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,750
trying to get back to you now you know

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,310
that we're running in the file you're

00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,410
sharing all these resources with other

00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:40,460
apps it would probably get it back and

00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:43,130
you have to be very not happy if some

00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,650
other apps access to your app source

00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,950
code or data right no I'll have to have

00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:49,160
it

00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,990
your such as private right so in order

00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:53,329
to make it so that your cloud neighbors

00:44:50,990 --> 00:44:55,250
play nice to each other we have a

00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:57,320
restricted environment you're executing

00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,380
the sandbox you do not have woken full

00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,290
okay so there are certain things that

00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:05,630
you cannot do we don't allow you to open

00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:08,930
a local file we don't allow you to

00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:11,180
create a socket and go along an existing

00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:13,670
calls because those things could be

00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:15,560
potentially dangerous all right but why

00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:17,210
would you want to open a socket I mean

00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,730
really if your app is kind of a pass on

00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,920
it pretty much useless citizen array he

00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,800
be able communicate me up at world so

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,829
instead of beating the sockets will give

00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,010
you usually go and make a call to Laura

00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:34,310
and get the results will let you send or

00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:36,230
receive email as your app can do that as

00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,609
an email pretty obvious but sometimes

00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:40,430
people didn't know that you can see me

00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:43,190
Mulder as well same goes for I am or is

00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:45,380
messaging shot exton TV you're going to

00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,359
actually send these messages from your

00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:51,290
app or we see these messages you can

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:55,040
write like a cat box or sort we gave you

00:45:51,290 --> 00:46:00,680
the ability to go in cash and distribute

00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,270
event passion for you if you have jos it

00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:04,849
involves absolutely other research is

00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,829
you have to execute everything your

00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:08,510
Apple a new request comes in that I'm

00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:10,849
request must finish it you must respond

00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:12,410
back to the user in 30 seconds it

00:46:10,849 --> 00:46:14,450
because we can't have you taking all the

00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:17,450
resources with other users so there's a

00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:19,099
30 seconds if you're trying to do

00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:22,490
something and it takes longer than 30

00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:24,170
seconds evensong a task and how to the

00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:26,630
background and you can have up to ten

00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:28,460
minutes to that and that's not long

00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,500
enough you are just about server and

00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:32,180
have it running on App Engine you can do

00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,910
that we call that backends don't have

00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:36,950
the icon here for it yet that's all back

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,690
in so you have to have servicing they're

00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:40,910
running you're at it and have all the

00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,160
time always love is always there so

00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:48,609
there's no more deadlines if you have a

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:53,240
writing service so each use every slice

00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:55,520
have either an agency and our users have

00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:57,349
a Google account if you lost or if you

00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,960
don't refuse is to having a google

00:46:57,349 --> 00:47:02,510
account you can use open IE so he is

00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,190
more flexible mobile and we're actually

00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:08,119
work on and improve this over that you

00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:10,400
may even more channel so that your

00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,079
future we also need this API so that you

00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,560
want to let host of the photo album

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,780
there we have the API SUV size of it is

00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,510
profit it is rotating it is not a normal

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,190
things that you want to do images so the

00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:22,920
preview photographers you want to host a

00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:25,589
report

00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:28,200
and it was automatic you upload a

00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:30,030
massive wad that'd be to do is decide

00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:36,359
before you can make thumbnails for you

00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:38,309
the SE cages pills of this customer so

00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:41,280
yes we give these eight guys because you

00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:43,829
don't have the ability to eventually get

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:46,890
a little clouds but we do have a 58 guy

00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:50,010
you create a civic while you just had no

00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:51,930
good temporary / can't plug you know a

00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:54,329
local file on boxes you don't know how

00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:56,730
you lost your shoes writing on so so you

00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:58,770
use the violators you have distributed

00:47:56,730 --> 00:48:00,390
violent share all the instances of your

00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:06,240
outfit which i think is a better

00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:08,460
solution and so in summary we add

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:10,980
features of antigen all the time this

00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:13,380
list is changing so often it going to be

00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,599
this kind of a talk I have to update the

00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,980
slide and running out of room here so

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,450
I'm going to have this consolidated do

00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,400
all 2,000 al 2009-2010 a 20-month

00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:27,540
English a book or either baby were told

00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,460
services together we have the

00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:31,770
documentation the augmentation have

00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,049
categories and you can go to Edward love

00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:38,190
the services that nobody was assisting

00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:41,309
the API sock but there's no and off to

00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:43,500
know a single place there's also sort of

00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:45,630
a services paid brigands they want to go

00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:48,450
to happen as you know like mobile stuff

00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:51,450
so easily yes you should be so you know

00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,430
I know that has to be maintained well

00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:57,700
it's not as maintained as the regular

00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:01,950
doxa ok read about on stage yes

00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,950
which we use a success the service

00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,869
so the question was about URL so i gave

00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:13,109
my own URL so we gave you one for free

00:49:09,869 --> 00:49:15,119
apps combo and use that if you want

00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:21,420
maybe it also see me that something else

00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:23,009
didn't go and just redirected yes so for

00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,710
example the most recent things that we

00:49:23,009 --> 00:49:27,779
just came up with or the boat launch

00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:30,660
announced until be preview pool cues in

00:49:27,779 --> 00:49:32,970
addition to pascal so not only he great

00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:35,220
ass and lavenders to run the right way

00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:38,369
it's going to be as possible but pool

00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:40,680
cues are where you can aid the queue you

00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:42,839
can actually create this cast even from

00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,750
an average apple point is currently by

00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:48,630
posting it as starts consuming those

00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:51,660
that casts the poll give you can have

00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:53,490
happened a lot of a full pass out of the

00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:55,619
pool yourself or having straw hat

00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:58,170
fullest so you can manage two different

00:49:55,619 --> 00:50:02,009
jobs where at is easier the producible

00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:03,779
consumer or both or either okay so

00:50:02,009 --> 00:50:06,269
that's a that's another future we get

00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:10,710
back into each one long term of service

00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:12,630
outside a demain so just yesterday we

00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:15,750
released a pigeon one point five point

00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:16,760
one so this one of the main ones 1.5

00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,130
because I

00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:22,130
well yesterday we had least of all my 50

00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:24,170
on which is having Jill a header files

00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:27,140
you gave you know figure out where

00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:29,180
you're at or very easily at we support

00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:33,740
the left image format now we have a

00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:36,590
photo RPC and a PR cr-z we also have HIV

00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,250
as okay which may I mean to lot of the

00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:41,650
over the world

00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:45,120
and his channel presence also channels

00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:51,220
basically let you know like begin or

00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:55,570
sits out WebSockets more like a dress so

00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:59,230
hrd chrg is our our livelihood if it is

00:50:55,570 --> 00:51:01,750
or CA you choose one when you open when

00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,460
you start your app hrd is more reliable

00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:06,400
one so that's a default and we recommend

00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:08,530
that one the other one the other one is

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,690
not as reliable it might be slightly

00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:12,940
faster but the performance is really

00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:14,110
about the same now so we all recommend

00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,570
people using the high replication

00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,370
datastore because it's more reliable all

00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:21,010
right so you may have heard like over

00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:22,840
the last year that on you know certain

00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,490
periods of the year in twenty ten or

00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,650
twelve two thousand nine that App Engine

00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:27,910
datastore was not as reliable so we

00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,320
wanted to address that because I was

00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:31,270
hurting a lot of customers so that's

00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,430
where high replication datastore came in

00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:35,200
at the beginning of this year and so and

00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,610
it's so popular and it works so well now

00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,590
that we recommend that because it's much

00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:41,350
much much more reliable so that's not as

00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:43,300
much of an issue anymore so as far as

00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:45,310
what we're working on for the future so

00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,630
one thing is again we mentioned we're

00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:49,900
coming out of preview mode so it will

00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:52,030
become an official product okay one

00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:54,100
thing that you cannot do with if you do

00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:56,170
choose to see name is that we don't have

00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:57,520
XSL access yet so people have been

00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:00,310
asking for that so just keep that in

00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:02,890
mind we also want to have improved

00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:05,350
import export of data into the data

00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:07,270
store we're going to have full MapReduce

00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:09,700
right now we just have the map the

00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:11,910
mapper and we are working on finishing

00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:14,920
the shuffle part and the reduced part

00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:16,870
but you can you can map out you can map

00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,820
over a large set of data now so at least

00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:21,760
there's part of it it just doesn't have

00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:24,130
the self-produced yet so we gave a talk

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,440
at Google i/o on the current status of

00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:28,150
MapReduce so if you want to find out

00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:30,970
more about that status and you just go

00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:32,890
to google.com / io to go to see all the

00:52:30,970 --> 00:52:34,840
talks just click on the App Engine talks

00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,430
and you'll see the MapReduce one the

00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,410
other talk that we gave IO is about

00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:40,030
full-text search okay so for some reason

00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:43,210
people think that Google is a search

00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:46,060
company ok and then why could I not do

00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:48,070
searches in my app engine now ok well

00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,450
you know the google web crawler is I

00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:51,680
mean the Google search engine is made to

00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:54,619
grep the internet

00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,300
not your data okay so we had to have a

00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:57,790
separate team build this thing from

00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,230
scratch and not only can you do

00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:02,599
searching texts over your data store but

00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:05,119
you can also do Geo searches you can

00:53:02,599 --> 00:53:07,490
search for you know datetime things now

00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,540
so that is also going to be launched

00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:10,190
very soon and you can find out more

00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:11,480
about that by looking at that Google i/o

00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:14,710
talk as well that's very exciting

00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:18,740
actually working on Python 27 support

00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:21,260
right now we're on 25 only better

00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,869
monitoring and alerting system and we

00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:25,309
want to raise some limits that you know

00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:26,960
people are asking for but if you want to

00:53:25,309 --> 00:53:29,329
see the roadmap the public road map is

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,470
down here so just go to the web page and

00:53:29,329 --> 00:53:41,089
you can go look at what's currently on

00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:43,690
the roadmap a question ok that's a good

00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:43,690
comment

00:53:51,269 --> 00:54:02,159
I don't know how many minutes ago that

00:53:57,329 --> 00:54:04,259
was though three or four a dish dish in

00:54:02,159 --> 00:54:05,909
terms of this entire screen all this

00:54:04,259 --> 00:54:07,529
entire screen is the App Engine roadmap

00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:09,479
so those of you who are watching the

00:54:07,529 --> 00:54:11,399
video all I just did was went over these

00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:13,469
bullet points to do it on your own

00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:15,149
without me in fact just go to them just

00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:16,049
go to the web page because that's

00:54:15,149 --> 00:54:19,229
probably have more up-to-date

00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:21,329
information actually I think so that's

00:54:19,229 --> 00:54:23,999
what we're working on so we don't like

00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:26,369
to do vaporware okay where it doesn't

00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,989
exist if you see something on the road

00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:29,899
but that means there's at least one

00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:33,509
engineer actively working on it already

00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:35,159
okay we will not tree announce anything

00:54:33,509 --> 00:54:36,899
you can think of this as already as a

00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:38,729
pre announcement for not agreeing on

00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:40,439
something I'm working on okay so we are

00:54:38,729 --> 00:54:44,279
actively working on these things right

00:54:40,439 --> 00:54:45,000
now I still need something yes how can I

00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:47,280
come

00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,710
that my data doesn't migrate to

00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:53,500
companies meaning

00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:55,390
okay right now so the question is how

00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:57,220
can i prevent my data from being

00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,380
migrated to countries where my data is

00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,200
not allowed to be in okay so right now

00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:04,570
App Engine all of the App Engine data

00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,330
centers of that running google data

00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:09,730
centers only in the u.s. right now so

00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:11,980
all the data centers that your app

00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:15,190
engine app runs on runs out of google

00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:18,520
data centers in America not in the EU

00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:20,109
not in Asia and Australia museum all the

00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,080
data centers are currently in the u.s.

00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:25,780
we are working on providing European and

00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:30,960
Asian support but that is not ready at

00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:33,190
this time okay so just so you all right

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,410
let's talk a little bit about Google

00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,390
Apps now some people get Google Apps

00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:38,500
confused with App Engine they really

00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,990
don't have anything to do with each

00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:43,390
other Google Apps is like Gmail Google

00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,310
Calendar Google Docs all right that's

00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:48,010
apps not at the engine all right so I

00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:50,560
want to make that clear but you can

00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:52,750
write App Engine apps that run it's on

00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:55,810
your apps domain okay what does that

00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:58,030
mean so when you put you to buy or use

00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:01,030
Google Apps it's pretty much free for a

00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:04,839
few users and you get you're gonna get

00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:08,530
you get gmail google calendar in google

00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:10,020
docs and that all runs on Google's

00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:13,150
infrastructure in google data centers

00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:15,040
but you can also add in your own custom

00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:17,230
a patent applications to this whole base

00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,789
and it will show up in your apps domain

00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:22,869
control pound just

00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:25,119
absolute control all right so so instead

00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:27,669
of music Fiat SpA company they'll give

00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,289
you you have a Google Apps domain and so

00:56:27,669 --> 00:56:31,059
you can actually access your app using

00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:35,380
google absolutely so that's another way

00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:37,959
to maintain the way you do it is you

00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:40,029
tell apps that a I have an app engine

00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:43,509
app I want you to register that with

00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:44,829
apps and then in your control panel here

00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:46,689
where you can control your emails to

00:56:44,829 --> 00:56:49,329
your gmail settings your calendar

00:56:46,689 --> 00:56:51,369
settings and cool doc settings your app

00:56:49,329 --> 00:56:52,809
engine app will be put in here just as

00:56:51,369 --> 00:56:55,959
if it was something you bought from

00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:58,119
google except you wrote it ok so to your

00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:59,829
users you know to your users you'll just

00:56:58,119 --> 00:57:01,839
look like anything because a normal app

00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:05,609
that showed up on the system so that's

00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:08,859
an interesting way to you everything ok

00:57:05,609 --> 00:57:12,069
alright so that's the end of the main

00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:13,630
presentations that I have let me show

00:57:12,069 --> 00:57:15,549
you a little bit about getting started

00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:17,259
and then we can have choose the ending

00:57:15,549 --> 00:57:18,880
of our story gear whether you guys want

00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:20,529
to start coding right now if you have

00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,089
your laptop's if you want to start

00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:23,739
putting up and I can show you how to do

00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:25,839
that or talk about other google cloud

00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:27,279
technologies to so let me just at least

00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:28,839
show you what it looks like if you were

00:57:27,279 --> 00:57:30,370
to do this yourself in your own hotel

00:57:28,839 --> 00:57:33,310
room or during break

00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:37,000
have a nice long break ok so there's

00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:39,340
only 60 or elles you have to memorize ok

00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,540
so we started with the blog at the very

00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:44,290
bottom so you should keep an eye on a

00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:47,560
blog you know we update vlog every every

00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:51,370
week a reality it's pretty active to

00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:53,380
probe and create an account you go to a

00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,940
bed and a google com so this is where

00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,800
you log into your apps and you manage

00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:59,590
your app so you do have to have a phone

00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,910
that does text messaging using SMS and

00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:04,750
because we need to confirm that you are

00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:06,310
you so that's where you do that if you

00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:08,080
are a Java user and you want to get

00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:11,320
access to the Eclipse plug-in you go to

00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:15,010
code up google com / eclipse if we want

00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:19,150
to get to the you know the SDK the

00:58:15,010 --> 00:58:20,650
public public open source clients where

00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:22,660
you have access to the wiki the issue

00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:26,320
tracker it's like that it's otay

00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:27,880
google.com / p / Google App Engine main

00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,130
homepage ravaged and already told you on

00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,690
the first slide is koda google account /

00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:33,610
App Engine that's where you can go

00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:38,020
download the SDK that's where the docs

00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:40,090
are that's the main homepage so there is

00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:42,010
an online tutorial 3 to get started the

00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:45,160
helloworld tutorial like any other you

00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:47,770
know product but if you get the on hello

00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:50,200
world you want any more than that some

00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:52,360
of us at Google have created additional

00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:54,220
code labs that go you know they give you

00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,930
more that go up with me on the

00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:58,900
helloworld tutorial so you can access

00:58:55,930 --> 00:59:00,700
that at the bit ly /g code labs you can

00:58:58,900 --> 00:59:03,710
actually get code laps for App Engine

00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:08,330
for Android or html5 pro

00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:09,710
even for way if you like wave okay so so

00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:11,599
bunch of us on the team I'm created

00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:14,420
these four users if you want to just try

00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:15,830
out travel to different a peons ok so

00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:17,839
when you get started with that and

00:59:15,830 --> 00:59:19,780
you go to the web page we download it

00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:23,300
again here are the more important links

00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:24,500
i forgot to mention that as the main web

00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,540
page you can also get access to the

00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:28,910
forums can also go to stack overflow

00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,680
because we have google engineers looking

00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:33,290
at psycho employ any questions about App

00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:35,839
Engine there but if you have a real

00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:37,339
serious question i would suggest you

00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:40,430
check both stack overflow as well as the

00:59:37,339 --> 00:59:42,320
forms both good places now forums are

00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:43,640
also monitored by google employees as

00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,410
well so you would actually come to the

00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,390
forums if you have more specific

00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:49,070
problems like you know billing issues or

00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,690
quota problem for whatever those things

00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,520
people can't help you work on Stack

00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:56,990
Overflow you can only help you with the

00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:58,640
technology in the API ok so what happens

00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:01,160
is when you download it you can either

00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,900
choose to run an app into the depth the

01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,030
government server off the command line

01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:07,040
so you would i gu dev app server ducky

01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:10,130
wide or if you're using Windows or Mac

01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:12,109
you can get a UI or if using job and

01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:13,849
then you have Eclipse okay so this is if

01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:15,859
you're doing Python you're running on

01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:17,300
mac and windows and you don't like to

01:00:15,859 --> 01:00:19,310
use a command line okay then you can

01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,109
rather development server like this just

01:00:19,310 --> 01:00:23,119
like you can type of a man lack or you

01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:24,830
can deploy your app live upload it to

01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,200
App Engine by using captain fig update

01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:28,900
and this the deploy button okay so

01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,820
whatever you're comfortable

01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:34,780
we just have to provide your credentials

01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:36,910
again okay all right so when you create

01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:38,980
a branding project using one of these

01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:41,200
you eyes you get these three files for

01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:42,640
free if you're not using you know if

01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:45,040
you're using dis linux where we don't

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,990
have you know you why you have to kind

01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,870
of create these two three files to agree

01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,730
files from scratch so but it's not that

01:00:49,870 --> 01:00:53,530
marred the indexed IV animal is not

01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:55,240
necessary average and will tell you what

01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:56,650
you need when you need an index file

01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:59,710
with two most important ones with the

01:00:56,650 --> 01:01:01,060
config file which is a PMO and your main

01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:03,190
control ring that people like you have

01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:05,470
other people I files as well we can roll

01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,240
in your other any other Python project

01:01:05,470 --> 01:01:08,890
as well as if if you don't like our

01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,480
jungle one point to support you can

01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,920
actually take the Django 1.3

01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,560
distribution and just drop that into

01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,930
your app okay just make sure you filter

01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:18,400
out filter out all of the

01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:20,470
internationalization stuff that you do

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,260
not need because there's a maximum file

01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:25,360
limit of three thousand files three

01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:28,150
thousand files including static files so

01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:29,800
be very careful we support the zip file

01:01:28,150 --> 01:01:31,300
so if you want to throw all your DIY

01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,500
fails into a zip file so you can get

01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,720
around the three thousand five

01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,890
limitation you can do that too okay but

01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,180
you know for example if you guys are

01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:38,740
Django developers you know that certain

01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:41,980
things you can't put in a ziploc as we

01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:43,570
use of life manage py okay so that you

01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:45,250
have to have out but other other

01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:47,200
libraries that we can have a zip file to

01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:49,210
kind of get around this limitation until

01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:53,230
we can get this changed or lifted some

01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:54,670
time okay all right so when you edit the

01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:56,230
app dog animal you can see that the

01:01:54,670 --> 01:01:58,030
configuration is you have to give your

01:01:56,230 --> 01:02:00,370
application name followed by the Virgin

01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:01,000
which could be any string you're using

01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:03,190
the pine

01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:05,650
time right now we're using API version 1

01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:09,130
so compact on 2.7 support comes out

01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:11,110
they'll probably be version 2 and then

01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,820
down here you specify all of your

01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:15,190
handlers so you give regular expressions

01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:17,350
to all the URLs and whatever URL smacks

01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:18,970
the pattern they get handled by this by

01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:21,040
the hamlet let you specify so you can

01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:23,190
have more than one but this is this just

01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:26,620
says may not be wise to handle every URL

01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:28,690
okay I do have a question yeah it said

01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:30,130
it's probably a very silly question you

01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:35,200
mentioned earlier on this one if you

01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:40,360
were personal getting honest you put

01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:42,040
some limitation on the other books yet

01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:46,000
those shits oh yeah beekeeper aggressive

01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,500
yes that's right president question no

01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,480
that's question people ask all the time

01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:51,810
anyway so yes can you develop a rescue

01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,810
service

01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:04,560
you have given so this show that using

01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:14,790
or do you I cannot work oh yeah that's

01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:18,450
right not in the next that's right so I

01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:22,280
think that gives a pilot so I have at

01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:26,540
least 45 oh yeah I'm wrong lyrics yes

01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:29,550
but if you have I don't think hi Deb has

01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:32,670
the pydev plugin doesn't have the same

01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:34,800
stuff as the Eclipse the google eclipse

01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,090
plugin so that's the thing yeah you can

01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:38,010
use it close to do to your python

01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:42,590
development but it doesn't have the UI

01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:42,590
features so question

01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:50,010
what

01:03:51,569 --> 01:03:56,489
what can he what are we using to build

01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:58,529
the sandbox it's it's custom-made so we

01:03:56,489 --> 01:04:01,469
restrict the things that you can do is

01:03:58,529 --> 01:04:04,289
for example for java you can only use

01:04:01,469 --> 01:04:05,969
the white listed class list for Python

01:04:04,289 --> 01:04:08,699
you don't have access to all of the

01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:10,079
modules and so there's a web page you

01:04:08,699 --> 01:04:11,579
can email me later or you can just

01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,079
google for there's a web page that says

01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:14,759
what modules you can't use with that

01:04:13,079 --> 01:04:16,619
venture basically you can't upload

01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:19,769
anything with C code and it has to be

01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:21,569
pure python okay and things like see

01:04:19,769 --> 01:04:22,739
pitbull don't exist because of even for

01:04:21,569 --> 01:04:25,589
see people is really just going to

01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:27,449
import pickle all right you don't you

01:04:25,589 --> 01:04:29,940
can't you know you can't use you know

01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:32,579
obviously OS that system is not going to

01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,319
work okay so a lot of things just don't

01:04:32,579 --> 01:04:38,869
exist you you'll get exception or it's

01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:38,869
empty this is a list for that

01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:45,410
no no it's it's just it's just white

01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:50,300
listening and some customers custom

01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:52,250
sandboxing alright so when you do create

01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:53,839
your sample app it makes a hello world

01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:55,640
for you this is what the app sort of

01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:57,230
looks like when you get this is sort of

01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,520
my optimized version of what you get

01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,829
automatically I'm actually trying to

01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,359
change via the UI so that it

01:05:00,829 --> 01:05:03,890
automatically makes Piper go to looks

01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:07,640
like this it's not as formatted that's

01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:10,220
nicely if this so I just just lower my

01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:13,460
priority list right now but anyway so

01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:15,440
you can see that for your handlers you

01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:17,270
list out all your URLs of your handling

01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:18,920
so the regular regular expression

01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:20,359
redirects everything here and from here

01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,760
you can kind of spawn off different

01:05:20,359 --> 01:05:25,609
handler classes all right so it's a with

01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:27,109
we support whiskey all right so you

01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:28,640
created a whiskey app and defying all

01:05:27,109 --> 01:05:30,440
your handlers and whatever handled you

01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,240
get facing URL from up here you can

01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:34,069
either write and get a more a post

01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:35,810
method all right to handle those

01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:37,600
requests and then use do whatever you

01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:39,790
need to do and then

01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,100
it go from here okay it's pretty

01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:43,900
straightforward web app is just one

01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:45,670
example this is the web but the

01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:47,590
lightweight web framework that we

01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:51,640
provide for free but you can also use

01:05:47,590 --> 01:05:53,470
Django if you want and you can there's

01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:56,500
also external frameworks that you can

01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:58,780
use like tip TTIP FY with another very

01:05:56,500 --> 01:06:01,230
popular bikeway framework it's an

01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:04,360
important suit style like flask actually

01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:06,610
and someone else also working on web app

01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,890
tube which is external as well so I

01:06:06,610 --> 01:06:10,930
think the most important thing is that

01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,220
you know if you just want to try it then

01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:14,080
you can use web app but if you want to

01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:17,500
use any more serious you can so we

01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:20,290
support Django 0.96 all would at one

01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:22,030
point to you want 1.3 like I said you

01:06:20,290 --> 01:06:24,130
can kind of just install that yourself

01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:25,990
with the rest of your out there one

01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,400
tricky cuz im using Django is that if

01:06:25,990 --> 01:06:28,780
you really want to write a django app we

01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,120
run around a pinch and we also have to

01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,100
go and download django django Dontrelle

01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,050
and general App Engine right everybody

01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:37,200
know about that ok because Django only

01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:40,120
runs on relational databases right now

01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:41,830
so to make it run on top of App engines

01:06:40,120 --> 01:06:44,770
non-relational database indeed is gone

01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:47,930
well layer so non realm has even

01:06:44,770 --> 01:06:50,810
backhands for for App Engine

01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:54,080
and for they're working on like the

01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:55,850
Sandra simple de think like that so

01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:58,010
they're trying to provide a generic

01:06:55,850 --> 01:07:00,860
layer to help make genuine on

01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:02,720
non-relational databases so you can look

01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:04,820
them up so once you're done with your

01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:07,670
appt I can go and you know again click

01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:09,200
on run on the GUI or I can just say dev

01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:11,180
app server dumb people and in the

01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:13,400
directory that my app is in where the

01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:15,620
three files are not abdominal and main

01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,240
deck py again the index is optional so

01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:19,430
once you do that until the directory

01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:21,080
name it starts your server again you can

01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:22,700
also use a launcher and when you go to a

01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,560
web browser you go to whatever port that

01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,880
you started it on gin generically if you

01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:27,740
don't specify the four to five eighty

01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,420
eighty or eight thousand you can see

01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:32,060
your hello world so that's exactly the

01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:33,890
same code that we had here that you can

01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:35,810
see on your local machine and once

01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:38,690
you're ready to go live you go to a page

01:07:35,810 --> 01:07:41,000
of google com you register these are you

01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:42,240
put your SMS that path your secret in it

01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,920
and then

01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,660
through your app you tell what kind of

01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:47,280
data store you want to use what kind of

01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:49,860
authentication you want to use google

01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,510
account over that he or whatever and

01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:53,220
then everything's good so once you're

01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:55,080
happy exists oh you one thing you have

01:07:53,220 --> 01:07:57,630
to remember resent it since you get in

01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,190
each app ID appspot com you have to pick

01:07:57,630 --> 01:08:01,140
a name that haven't been chosen already

01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:04,290
okay so you have to be very creative

01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:06,420
there all right and if you it's a

01:08:04,290 --> 01:08:08,760
one-time thing once that name is taken

01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:10,650
and what it can never get it again so if

01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:12,600
you care about that URL don't delete it

01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:13,830
and you delete your app it's not like

01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:17,150
it's going to come back into the system

01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:19,319
it's gone forever and keep that money

01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:20,970
anyway so this is what your computer

01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:23,040
control panel look like he'll tell you

01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:26,490
like what your app names are and what

01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:28,290
your conversion it is so currently right

01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:30,600
now because we're still in preview mode

01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:33,930
you can get up to 10 applications for

01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:35,730
free but once we go official we go live

01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:36,779
and you know becomes an official product

01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:41,759
you know we're going to get three

01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:43,140
applications okay so sign up now it

01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:43,750
won't be until like towards the end of

01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,190
the year

01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:47,230
so you don't panic like it's a

01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:51,009
convenient they wear nothing up change

01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:55,720
it to three but yeah again the whole

01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:56,740
ideas try before you buy really also so

01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,240
the other thing is when you get your

01:08:56,740 --> 01:09:00,009
when you have your app dog animal of

01:08:58,240 --> 01:09:01,720
course it generate the generic name like

01:09:00,009 --> 01:09:03,100
hello world obviously job let's take it

01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,690
already so you have to be to change that

01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:05,980
if you wouldn't want to put it live if

01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:08,020
you're just wanting to develop a server

01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:09,460
the SDK it doesn't matter what that is

01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,779
right because no else to be using it but

01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:13,690
if you're uploading live it has to be

01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:15,549
this name appspot com is your actual cat

01:09:13,690 --> 01:09:17,680
like evening alright so just be aware of

01:09:15,549 --> 01:09:20,770
that and when you're ready to go you can

01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:23,350
just do at configured ey other day again

01:09:20,770 --> 01:09:25,509
the directory where your files are so

01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:27,069
this is f engine technician I've done

01:09:25,509 --> 01:09:29,470
this I should have just seen you to

01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:30,970
desktop / google app engine not a little

01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:34,240
world because i always have to do how

01:09:30,970 --> 01:09:36,880
config update dot right if the directory

01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:38,589
game okay if I see eat into it unless I

01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,970
have a subject called the same thing we

01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:41,859
should do that they asking for your

01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:46,089
credentials I hear your email password

01:09:41,859 --> 01:09:47,589
on the email and password and then you

01:09:46,089 --> 01:09:49,420
just go to your iPod need appspot.com

01:09:47,589 --> 01:09:53,529
eat your app is again live to the world

01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:56,380
except for maybe China ok so that's how

01:09:53,529 --> 01:10:00,310
that works alright so that's that's the

01:09:56,380 --> 01:10:02,880
end of the top thanks for coming and i

01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:06,190
can again we have a few minutes left so

01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,320
i'll take Q&A now but afterwards i can

01:10:06,190 --> 01:10:10,840
either show you how to do epic and live

01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:12,310
on the screen or i can tell you about

01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:14,650
other google cloud products are

01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:16,489
interested so let's ask the Q&A first

01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:19,730
and then if you not asking

01:10:16,489 --> 01:10:23,090
they can also say other cloud or App

01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:26,389
Engine okay all right anybody with

01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:29,420
questions I guess he asked on your

01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:32,719
questions already okay Raymond so you

01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:35,230
had mentioned this case where developers

01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,230
to mean another

01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:43,020
that's right and if we set some limited

01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:46,640
said i will pay for up to this amount

01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:51,320
this is billing they can get Paige to

01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:51,320
reauthorize I'll take a pill really

01:10:56,020 --> 01:11:00,510
someone does a

01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:00,510
I

01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,820
okay good questions or I'll take the

01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,820
first one first which is do you free

01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:15,280
allocate you pay for stuff so yeah so

01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:17,680
basically when you turn on building

01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:20,050
right now so we give you a free quota

01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:22,060
that's great right but if you trust

01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:23,950
Google enough to give us your credit

01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:26,830
card number will give even more free

01:11:23,950 --> 01:11:28,630
quota okay and only if you exceed that

01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:31,930
additional quota do you actually get

01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:34,420
charged all right so what happens is so

01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:36,580
Google scales and up to a point where

01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:38,050
you reach your maximum and so what is

01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:40,870
the maximum you said you go so you do

01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:43,989
you do set a budget if you want more

01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:46,600
services but the current default is you

01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:48,550
get like one gigabyte of incoming band

01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:51,670
with a day as well as one gigabyte it

01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:52,810
out bound data so if you think you're

01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:56,020
going to exceed that then you really

01:11:52,810 --> 01:11:58,330
should set your budget accordingly so my

01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:00,850
suggestion is over allocate your budget

01:11:58,330 --> 01:12:04,870
put in a really large number the reason

01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:06,430
why is because and I've had people do

01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,840
this which is not a good idea so you

01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:09,040
allocate sermon because you know they

01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,630
don't have a lot of money they're afraid

01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:13,900
that we was going to charge them so much

01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:16,480
money for my business all right that

01:12:13,900 --> 01:12:17,920
they had a very low budget and when

01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:19,540
their traffic up to the point where

01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,310
they're hitting their limit and they

01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:23,260
asked us to own we need to up our budget

01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:25,840
we go our budget the problem with that

01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:28,270
is it takes a while for that to happen

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,850
okay the reason is because this is a

01:12:28,270 --> 01:12:32,860
recurring charge and those are different

01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:34,180
from let me go to a store the market by

01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,739
something in charge of credit card is

01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:38,080
very different when it's repeating has a

01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:40,120
very few more security it takes longer

01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:42,340
so when you do it when you set up

01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:44,230
building through app engine it has to go

01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:45,430
to check out and then Google Checkout

01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:47,860
hasn't talked to your credit card

01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:50,140
company has to authorize that occurring

01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:52,780
amount and so it doesn't happen

01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:55,120
instantaneously sometimes it taking more

01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:56,530
than eight hours okay because the credit

01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,930
card company is backlogged with these

01:12:56,530 --> 01:13:01,840
type of requests so if you're a panic

01:12:58,930 --> 01:13:03,820
situation it's too late okay so it's

01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,350
better to over allocate your budget and

01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:06,850
then if you don't if you know that

01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:09,460
you're at oh I'm never going to use this

01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:11,680
much budget then you can roll it down ok

01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:13,570
because bring your budget down does not

01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:15,219
require you to have to pre-authorize

01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:17,050
again with your credit card company so

01:13:15,219 --> 01:13:18,850
it's faster to bring the budget down

01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:22,190
that Lee's and make it go up over in a

01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:25,139
bad situation ok so that's one rep

01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:26,940
and then second question that Raymond

01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:30,929
had was about denial of service attacks

01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:32,309
so we do have a Doss API so and we

01:13:30,929 --> 01:13:34,199
actually tell you traffic's one of the

01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:36,960
things you cannot see on the on the

01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:38,699
control panel that was because the dots

01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,829
API stuff got added later there's

01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:42,960
actually a blacklist link at the end you

01:13:40,829 --> 01:13:44,400
can actually see from which IP addresses

01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,469
have given you the most traffic in the

01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,239
last in the current day and so if you

01:13:46,469 --> 01:13:50,429
think they're Russian spam or whatever

01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:52,860
you can actually filter up individual IP

01:13:50,429 --> 01:13:55,349
addresses you can filter out subnets you

01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:56,880
know you can control all that stuff of

01:13:55,349 --> 01:14:01,409
course they are no difficult if it's a

01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:04,079
do it if it's a DDoS so that's that that

01:14:01,409 --> 01:14:06,659
we can rely on google company to take

01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:09,449
care of because we also can tell we

01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:10,980
already have monitoring that takes care

01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:12,780
of that kind of stuff so that's sort

01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:17,219
beyond the App Engine but yes we do have

01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:21,160
a denial of service support okay yes sir

01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:25,000
I still have legal concerns you

01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:28,950
a few examples of already so for example

01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,950
i'm usually not allowed to low

01:14:30,260 --> 01:14:37,100
let's see you're not doing the logging

01:14:33,239 --> 01:14:37,100
Google is doing the long ones that count

01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:45,389
I see I don't believe it there's a way

01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:47,159
to turn that up and i might be wrong so

01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:49,969
it's best to drop me an email and ask me

01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:49,969
in the last the team

01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:55,899
getting invoice which shows the amount

01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:02,380
in Texas so right now so Google Checkout

01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:04,330
will show you what you're going to be

01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:08,020
paying including dat if you don't have a

01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:09,610
VA tid but we don't do invoicing yet the

01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:11,560
invoicing part will actually come only

01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:13,690
leave creamy road because some people

01:15:11,560 --> 01:15:20,620
want different forms of billing outside

01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:24,210
of Google Checkout yeah my hopes up it's

01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:27,210
supposed to be a real product right some

01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:29,340
question so

01:15:27,210 --> 01:15:33,369
I'm not sure you mention the fact that

01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:38,159
now you the reason to release I

01:15:33,369 --> 01:15:41,139
can jarate saoirse bathe her friend

01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:44,169
mechana circus that's full text search a

01:15:41,139 --> 01:15:48,459
hunt for the geographic that's right I

01:15:44,169 --> 01:15:50,639
can prove the point without a thorough

01:15:48,459 --> 01:15:52,809
and they just want me to this region

01:15:50,639 --> 01:15:54,429
yeah the best thing to do is to watch

01:15:52,809 --> 01:15:56,229
the talk at Google i/o that was given

01:15:54,429 --> 01:15:58,419
last month they give you a dell answer

01:15:56,229 --> 01:16:00,669
your questions okay but right now the

01:15:58,419 --> 01:16:02,349
product isn't out yet so I can't really

01:16:00,669 --> 01:16:05,769
say anything other than maybe that we

01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:07,749
drove up threes 1.5 or one paw we

01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:10,119
announced it at the same time we release

01:16:07,749 --> 01:16:12,789
1.5 but it is not in any release it's

01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:14,649
not a release product okay okay counting

01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:18,249
yes it's coming so watch the video

01:16:14,649 --> 01:16:22,419
Franklin yeah just like important for

01:16:18,249 --> 01:16:24,309
any GM sounds very interesting yeah we

01:16:22,419 --> 01:16:26,079
can't give dates okay mechanically mama

01:16:24,309 --> 01:16:28,239
say that yeah we can't give promises we

01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:29,919
can't keep but at least you'll know that

01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:32,320
we're working on it and then you may

01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:35,320
have they may give some sort of estimate

01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:39,869
in the video which I you need to wash

01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:39,869
myself actually ah

01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:46,400
mentioned it here guilty cuz I think

01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:46,400
about it can you stay

01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:52,600
yes right on bro uh-huh if you later

01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:54,990
decide that you want to offer black

01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:54,990
dungeon

01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:05,130
yeah and I was going to offer that's a

01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:07,200
both so first question is about well

01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:09,030
what if I want to if I decide that my

01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:11,130
django app I'd rather run it myself on

01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:13,860
my own status of that Benjen perfectly

01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:15,780
fine so in with that I suggest you use

01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:18,060
general none realm and just your writing

01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:19,250
against the Django orl anyway so it

01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:22,080
doesn't matter to you what's underneath

01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:24,570
but when you write against janggo town

01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:26,340
Darrell enjoy new app engine then you

01:17:24,570 --> 01:17:28,500
can just take your app lift it up and

01:17:26,340 --> 01:17:30,000
drop it somewhere else and just change

01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,260
the settings that we want so there's no

01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,120
vendor lock-in or anything like that you

01:17:31,260 --> 01:17:37,020
are not restricted to having to use

01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:39,140
Google's datastore API in fact the

01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:42,930
Django not real don't know App Engine

01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:46,080
shim basically that just makes Django's

01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:48,450
ORM talk to pathogens data store so you

01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:50,970
have to do that second question is cloud

01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:54,210
sequel so last year at Google i/o we

01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:55,770
announced a cloud sequel support right

01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:57,960
now that's still in the trusted tester

01:17:55,770 --> 01:18:00,390
phase so we're actually having you know

01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:01,980
large companies that require relational

01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:03,870
databases you know tests up the system

01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:06,810
help us debug it make the product ready

01:18:03,870 --> 01:18:09,090
for for production and for going live

01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:12,390
but it's not ready for that yet but we

01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:15,530
are working on it okay any other

01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:17,110
questions i answer

01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:19,900
aps conduit

01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:24,760
story you have blocks

01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:31,260
I believe so yes should be even using

01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:33,340
names what I still think it should I

01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:35,409
don't know what percent for sure but

01:18:33,340 --> 01:18:41,350
driving email find up for you but I have

01:18:35,409 --> 01:18:43,630
pretty much Napier that's okay anything

01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:45,340
else you guys want to hear other cloud

01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:47,199
or if you guys want to do live stuff oh

01:18:45,340 --> 01:18:49,090
yeah so I'm actually giving talks at

01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:51,370
other conferences so if you happen to be

01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:53,679
in the area just come by and say hi I

01:18:51,370 --> 01:18:56,170
like to like to meet users so I'm going

01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,690
to be at this ACM conference in New York

01:18:56,170 --> 01:18:59,949
in two weeks and then i'm going to ask

01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:01,390
Connor I don't know if anybody else is

01:18:59,949 --> 01:19:04,150
going to the open source convention in

01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:06,219
portland in four weeks and then i'm also

01:19:04,150 --> 01:19:07,690
giving a Python public course anybody

01:19:06,219 --> 01:19:09,640
can sign up forward and take it if you

01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:11,949
want an excuse to visit San Francisco

01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:13,540
all right it's come by very happy but I

01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:15,460
think you guys are email Python but I'll

01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:16,719
have an advance so that's an October I'm

01:19:15,460 --> 01:19:20,739
actually doing advanced class in

01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:22,239
February so but I just talking about

01:19:20,739 --> 01:19:24,130
other google cloud stuff like Google

01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:27,820
storage if you want or i can talk about

01:19:24,130 --> 01:19:29,620
the prediction API what you guys want to

01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:31,510
do App Engine or other google cloud

01:19:29,620 --> 01:19:35,119
stuff because I need to talk about

01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:43,340
Etherington that's done yeah

01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:45,919
okay okay it's great so last year last

01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:48,169
google i/o 2010 we announced three other

01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:50,599
cloud products Google storage Google

01:19:48,169 --> 01:19:52,159
prediction and then Google bigquery so

01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:53,929
I'll go over storage and prediction but

01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:56,329
sorry and talk about a pitch and that's

01:19:53,929 --> 01:19:57,679
off the list actually I need to get the

01:19:56,329 --> 01:19:59,389
prediction logo and these guys are still

01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,949
working on their logo so be interesting

01:19:59,389 --> 01:20:03,559
to see what what their icons look like

01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:05,689
bigquery is not rated alive yet but I'll

01:20:03,559 --> 01:20:09,709
tell you what it says bigquery is where

01:20:05,689 --> 01:20:11,689
you want to issue a sequel select call

01:20:09,709 --> 01:20:14,269
across you know five terabytes of data

01:20:11,689 --> 01:20:17,360
can't quite do that with my sequel today

01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:18,499
I don't think right and you need to be

01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,689
able to have the answer come back

01:20:18,499 --> 01:20:22,789
quickly okay so that's what big query is

01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:24,679
you upload a massive amount of data to

01:20:22,789 --> 01:20:26,809
Google and then you can run sequel

01:20:24,679 --> 01:20:28,579
queries on so that's what big query and

01:20:26,809 --> 01:20:30,169
you can it's still in preview mode and

01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:33,229
can go to the website you look forward

01:20:30,169 --> 01:20:34,459
to find out how you use it okay but i'ma

01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:37,340
tell you about storage and predictions

01:20:34,459 --> 01:20:39,559
so because we announced it the preview

01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,479
last year Google i/o this google i/o

01:20:39,559 --> 01:20:43,610
last month these products went live you

01:20:41,479 --> 01:20:45,199
don't have to be opted in anymore it's

01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:46,579
not wipe this anymore anybody can sign

01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,530
up for google storage account for

01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:52,909
prediction so Google storage is like

01:20:48,530 --> 01:20:54,979
Amazon s3 ret to disk basically so this

01:20:52,909 --> 01:20:56,659
cloud-based binary objects store you can

01:20:54,979 --> 01:20:58,189
have lots of buckets and many many

01:20:56,659 --> 01:21:02,119
outfits in those buckets you control

01:20:58,189 --> 01:21:03,979
your your data you know you can tell you

01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:05,449
have you have apples so you can say who

01:21:03,979 --> 01:21:06,040
gets access to it or not does a restful

01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:09,160
api

01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:10,780
like that so you know and all these

01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:12,130
other marketing things but the more

01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:14,590
important thing that you need to know is

01:21:12,130 --> 01:21:17,830
comparing amazon s3 vs. google storage

01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:20,590
ok so google storage has lower latency

01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:21,850
and it's also more reliable for large

01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:23,680
downloads like if you're downloading

01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:25,450
like a gigabyte chances are if I'm gonna

01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:27,820
get disconnected so you have to try we

01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:29,200
do it again so because it's faster and

01:21:27,820 --> 01:21:30,790
more reliable we charge a little bit

01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:31,900
more than amazon so those are probably

01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:34,630
the most important things you need to

01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:37,360
know and we already have a lot of users

01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:41,050
using it this is just a list of people

01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:42,940
who are using it before we went live and

01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:44,710
these are external users so we have

01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:46,390
internal users external users all right

01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:48,280
so since I'm running out of time will

01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:50,080
discover prediction really fast so the

01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:52,000
Google prediction API is probably going

01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:54,160
to be Google's most interesting API

01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,580
period because this is machine learning

01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:59,530
in the cloud ok so this is where you can

01:21:57,580 --> 01:22:01,510
do a call like this I can pass it some

01:21:59,530 --> 01:22:03,190
some phrase I can call it R addiction

01:22:01,510 --> 01:22:04,870
API and kind of tell you what it is so

01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:06,490
it's like a crystal ball just have to

01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:08,380
train it ok so if you know machine

01:22:06,490 --> 01:22:10,270

01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,920
what she learning it you supervise learn

01:22:10,270 --> 01:22:13,510
to have to do training you upload all

01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:15,370
your data and the training and then you

01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:17,290
can do predictions for example you

01:22:15,370 --> 01:22:19,630
upload these sentences and you say oh

01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:21,130
this is English this is Spanish the next

01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:22,450
time you upload the sentence it will

01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:24,010
actually be able to tell you which one

01:22:22,450 --> 01:22:25,690
they are based on the clues that it's

01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:28,240
gotten based on some keywords that it

01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:30,040
recognizes ok so this can be used for

01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:31,990
lots of different things like spam

01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:33,580
content like if you have a blog and you

01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:35,200
want to see whether or not think whether

01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:37,660
it's a spammer or not and you can block

01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,130
it or you can check you know for voting

01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:41,140
you know in which way are they meeting

01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:43,750
one political party versus another party

01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:45,640
or you know bad content for children or

01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:47,830
like how do people feel about your

01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,570

they mad with your product okay so you

01:22:50,909 --> 01:22:54,929
can do lots of different things with the

01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:56,610
prediction API it's restful okay so you

01:22:54,929 --> 01:22:57,869
basically just upload your data you

01:22:56,610 --> 01:22:59,929
train your data and then you can make

01:22:57,869 --> 01:23:04,739
predictions these are all rest cause

01:22:59,929 --> 01:23:07,170
okay and that's pretty much it so any

01:23:04,739 --> 01:23:08,820
other questions okay we only have time

01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:13,290
for like two more that's it yeah okay so

01:23:08,820 --> 01:23:15,409
um do you reuse the day because holding

01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:15,409
up

01:23:15,770 --> 01:23:22,070
train is your training the results of

01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:24,590
your training you

01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:27,739
isolates just use news where is it

01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:30,530
spread out all the uses of Google

01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:32,989
releases an emulation who doesn't reuse

01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:34,010
your stuff okay you control your model

01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:35,540
whether you want to start from scratch

01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:38,780
over time you train or whether you want

01:23:35,540 --> 01:23:40,699
to reduce an existing yeah you give me

01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:44,590
it's live now so the documentation is

01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:44,590
pretty fully featured okay last question

01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:53,000
I'll google storage oh you have a bunch

01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:54,949
of terabytes of data on s3 oh we provide

01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,320
is a really cool tool called GSU till

01:23:54,949 --> 01:23:58,909
okay so it uses botel if you're familiar

01:23:57,320 --> 01:24:00,650
with moto because that's a library that

01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:01,909
talks amazon but we've customized at the

01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:08,179
top Google storage you actually do

01:24:01,909 --> 01:24:10,130
something like GSU till CP ER s 3 colon

01:24:08,179 --> 01:24:13,250
slash slash the name of your bucket and

01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:14,869
then GS colon slash slash your google

01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:20,360
buckets you have to start massive copy

01:24:14,869 --> 01:24:22,550
jobs that way first for speed for

01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:24,650
latency and for reliability if you need

01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:26,750
it if you want cheaper stores you know
