r it was a big buzzword

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:47,170
it's pretty much reinventing the wheel

00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:51,370
that I'll cover that during the talk so

00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:54,820
anyway in the mid 90s we had en fast on

00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,909
Kyle castleman presenting this whole

00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,530
idea of the grid at that time we had the

00:00:57,909 --> 00:01:02,049
internet where you could easily access

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,110
all kind of information but they wanted

00:01:02,049 --> 00:01:07,570
to take that idea and spread it out to

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,570
all kinds of resources that is accessing

00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:15,190
computing power storage even special

00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:17,409
devices like telescopes accelerators

00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:22,899
like big accelerators so they have it at

00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:26,190
CERN and so on so they wanted this big

00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:31,030
unified access to all these resources

00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:32,979
and they had a focus on including things

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:36,880
like applications and also including

00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:39,810
people into the mix focus focusing on

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,579
sharing resources efficiently and

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,950
enabling collaboration between users

00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:49,049
especially using this term virtual

00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:51,880
organizations I'll come back to that so

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,100
after a few years of development we saw

00:01:51,880 --> 00:02:01,360
especially the globe us-based grid

00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:04,210
middleware taking on and they didn't

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,750
really managed to capture the original

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:10,239
vision in my view they worked quite well

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,540
for the for the specialized people who

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,630
were doing physics simulations and were

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:19,959
able to send out the data to different

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:23,500
machines and and handle jobs like a big

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,170
batch system but the ease of use and the

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,370
collaboration wasn't really part of the

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:32,620
of the package so we wanted to try to

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,810
address that with the this new grid

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,290
middleware called minimal intrusion grid

00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:44,019
or make for short and if I go back to

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,879
the previous slide the overall

00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:47,950
architecture in the global space grids

00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,470
the grits middle way

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,459
that I call first generation is this all

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:59,769
to all communication users and resources

00:02:53,459 --> 00:03:01,780
communicate also all this gives some

00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:04,480
limitations to the whole idea that we

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,260
wanted to move on to an architecture

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,450
where we had a centralized system of

00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,030
still distributed service but an actual

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,750
system separating the users from the

00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,430
resources my resources in this context

00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,910
could be classed as supercomputers and

00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,860
so on we also wanted to move the axial

00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:28,000
grid middleware to these central servers

00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:29,920
so that we didn't have to let force the

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,040
users and results I want us to install a

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,989
huge middleware and and maintain that we

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,610
moved all that to the to the central

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:43,450
servers another part of the original

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:46,450
vision was that the whole grid should

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:49,900
appear like this huge virtual machine to

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,510
the users and by doing this completely

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,359
different architecture we could actually

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:59,889
try to achieve that and from the

00:03:55,359 --> 00:04:02,290
resource perspective grid should just be

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,269
a set of users user accounts on the

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,970
resource so that we pretty much mapped

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:11,290
to the existing system where they had

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:15,069
local users already on the closest back

00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:19,450
then in the 90s we saw at centen see for

00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:22,960
a lot of things that had previously

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:26,680
taken place in labs enzymes moving to

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,220
simulations and later on we saw our

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,490
business intelligence data mining also

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,070
moving to computers instead of so we

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,080
suddenly had a large demand for

00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,740
computing power and we needed to do

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,930
achieve at the same time we saw

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,190
computing power being moved to data

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,080
centers where we have professional

00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:50,979
administrators taking care of all the

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:54,880
main scenes that will allow us to make

00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:56,979
it cheaper and more efficient easier for

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,930
the user if of course we can provide

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:01,620
some kind of interface for them that is

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,620
familiar

00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,639
just to try to avoid the pitfalls that

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,539
we saw from the first generation grids

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,639
we came up with these four rules that we

00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:17,199
try to follow very carefully the first

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,389
of them is the minimum intrusion we

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,550
don't want to force the users or

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,680
resource on us to install anything on

00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,340
their computers we try to keep it

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,550
everything keep everything on Lee said

00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:33,220
Mick servers the second one which is

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,460
probably a bit more important in in this

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:39,190
context is that we wanted to avoid the

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,229
mess of tons of different implementation

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,569
languages and simply stick with pison

00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,550
all the way through unless of course

00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:47,229
there were some things that we could not

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,759
work around for example when we work at

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:53,919
kernel level for some advanced optional

00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,990
client find their features then of

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,150
course we had to go away from that one

00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:02,530
but as long as we could mistake with

00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:05,289
Python and of course we wanted to keep

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,960
this transparency focus to keep the ease

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:10,360
of use and avoid users having to

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,440
manually tamper with a lot of details

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,400
that they don't really need to know

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,610
about ok so from the use of side things

00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,820
we have users just have a browser and

00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:25,060
they get a user certificate which is a

00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,509
standard x509certificate used in many

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,740
grits and they use that for their

00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:32,770
authentication and authorization to the

00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:35,919
grid that's what they need for order the

00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:38,770
base use if users want to do advanced

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,840
stuff for example script a large number

00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:43,630
of tasks then they can optionally

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:46,800
download additional scripts for that but

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:49,870
it's not really required to use it with

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,270
on the resource side we try to limit it

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:56,229
as much as we can again we don't require

00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:58,330
any installation simply create a number

00:06:56,229 --> 00:07:01,659
of user accounts on the resource that is

00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:04,870
in the quarter supercomputer and allow

00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:09,039
the mix servers to access those account

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:11,669
with which with an SSH in bout inbound

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,350
connection and allows the accounts to

00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:18,690
connect to the mixer

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:22,050
us using https many of the other grids

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:25,170
require special services and a lot of

00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,970
additional protocols that you need to

00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:30,060
open the firewall and resource

00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,500
administrators typically just run away

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,960
screaming when they hear those

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,520
requirements so we really try to limit

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,650
it as much as we could hear another

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,510
point is that we just this system

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,630
administrators that is the resource

00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,490
owners are just ordinary users in the

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,500
mid context so we'll have a user

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:51,960
certificate and they register the

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:56,310
resource with make and use the web

00:07:51,960 --> 00:08:00,270
interface and the general interface to

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,160
to manage the resources to make later on

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,490
we introduce some kind of sandboxed

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,930
resources as well that have even fewer

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:12,930
requirements put them on that later so

00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,940
to keep with the the idea of having a

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,160
virtual a big virtual machine or big

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:19,950
virtual computer for the users we

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,930
decided to stick with a model where we

00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:26,310
have a private use at home for each user

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:31,230
so each user has its own user home on

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:34,080
Mick and when users want to use files

00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,870
for example when they use jobs all file

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,740
references are relative to the user home

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:43,530
so this no need to specify my files are

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,510
on this in this server on and this isn't

00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:51,000
in this URL on the internet you just

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:53,760
reference them by the file path and in

00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,490
practice we've developed this this web

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,920
interface for file access to resembles

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,480
any local file manager so it should

00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:08,100
pretty much work like a big virtual copy

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:11,040
of your local computer you can of course

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:12,990
edit files and many a manipulation as

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,100
you want to and this is in line file

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,589
editor which is relatively simple but it

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,990
doesn't feel for you

00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:24,690
okay so generally when you work with

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:27,180
Britt you have some tasks that you want

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,630
done and you split out the tasks into

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:34,620
jobs so you have some kind of batch

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:38,160
commands that you want to run and you

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,839
need to specify how many resources those

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,550
commands will use for example how long

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,399
will it take to run them and how much

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,020
memory and stuff like that and then of

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,760
course if you have any input or output

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:52,529
files from the job and you want to

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,270
specify that as well so in Mick this is

00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:58,560
there's an addition because we had this

00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:00,570
centralized make system of service you

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,700
always just send your job to make and

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:05,880
let me handle all the job control

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:09,360
instead of having a local client keeping

00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,700
trap track of resources and gulps so you

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,640
sent a job to make where the job is cute

00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,440
and if you have multiple servers and of

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,149
course you can replicate the job to make

00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:24,000
sure that it is enforced and then when a

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:27,029
resource is available it will ask for a

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,900
job and make the schedule the a suitable

00:10:27,029 --> 00:10:33,240
job for that job slot sent the job there

00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,520
and make sure it gets executed of course

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,410
it's if something goes wrong and the job

00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,290
never returns then make takes care of

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:41,880
rescheduling it for another resource so

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,990
the user doesn't have to worry about

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,270
this if you want to cancel jobs or other

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:50,790
way freeze jobs and stuff like that you

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:55,589
can of course do that but otherwise you

00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:57,779
leave everything to make service if you

00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:00,060
actually want to do a great style

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,520
applications you again have some kind of

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,589
interface and then in the engine below

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:08,600
he is fled of the actual work and send

00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:12,630
it out of jobs so that's the typical use

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:14,760
again to keep things simple we've made a

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,010
web interface where you simply fill in

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,380
the commands you want to run in this

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,800
case it's the simplest job possible

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:24,870
hello grid and if you scroll scroll down

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,059
you can specify additional resource

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:28,919
requirements

00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,869
then you at the bottom of the page

00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:33,359
there's a submit button when you hit

00:11:30,869 --> 00:11:36,629
that the job gets cute with the mix

00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:39,599
service and you will see it in the jobs

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:41,579
list as cute first and then when it

00:11:39,599 --> 00:11:45,329
starts executing you will actually see

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:47,819
this tough image where the job is

00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:50,309
executing and then at some point when

00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:52,919
the resource finishes executing the job

00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,709
it will automatically switch to finished

00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:57,809
and then you can right-click on the on

00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:59,609
the job entries there and look at the

00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:03,509
results and output thousands stop of

00:11:59,609 --> 00:12:05,519
that so in this case i opened the status

00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:07,499
files that are they'll automatically

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,339
become available in your in your make

00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:14,849
user home and you see there are quite

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:17,129
cryptically named but you have the four

00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:20,279
files for each job stendhal out standard

00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:22,949
error and two status files for exit

00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:25,349
codes and in this particular case I open

00:12:22,949 --> 00:12:30,389
the standard out file which just

00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:33,749
displays the photo grid pretty simple as

00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:35,519
soon as you go beyond using just basic

00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:37,649
shell commands like the one I used here

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,049
you end up having to rely on the

00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:43,159
resources having some kind of software

00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:46,799
available for you and we just reused the

00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:48,539
general idea of runtime environments

00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,739
that is pretty common for a most fit

00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:56,279
Middle West so users and resources can

00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:58,999
negotiate conditions for the job by

00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,229
setting up runtime environments and

00:12:58,999 --> 00:13:03,629
specifying which runtime environments

00:13:01,229 --> 00:13:05,249
you need in your job so if you specify a

00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:07,349
particular runtime environment in your

00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:09,719
job the job will only be sent to

00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:10,979
resources that actually advertise the

00:13:09,719 --> 00:13:13,919
city of the corresponding runtime

00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:16,619
environment that's the one-to-one map

00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,469
there for this particular case I'll just

00:13:16,619 --> 00:13:23,399
show you a short example using a Python

00:13:19,469 --> 00:13:24,019
runtime environment so we have a Python

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,670
and

00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:29,749
runtime environment that just simply

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:32,959
indicates that any version 2.x of python

00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:37,160
is available on the resource and in the

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:42,889
job we can use python using the the

00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:45,199
dollar pipe and environment variable so

00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,689
in the actual web interface we have the

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,319
list of runtime environments and anyone

00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:53,119
can define new runtime environments but

00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:56,649
it's left for the resource on it to

00:13:53,119 --> 00:14:00,980
actually specify that my resource

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:04,129
implements this one time in the actual

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,489
case of a pipe and job I've taken a

00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:12,699
little sample here it uses the

00:14:06,489 --> 00:14:17,299
tribulation number algorithm so I have a

00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:21,049
Python application in my macomb called

00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:23,089
fit pie and i just opened in it in the

00:14:21,049 --> 00:14:26,089
editor it's very simple it's just a

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:28,399
naive implementation it takes the two

00:14:26,089 --> 00:14:30,559
previous if you cannot see numbers and

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,199
add some up to the next number so it

00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:36,199
recurs is back that way and then in the

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,299
actual job I'll take that from the

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:41,240
bottom here because first of all I need

00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:43,670
the Python Python interpreter at as a

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,740
resource so I specify i want a Python to

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:49,249
run time environment and then I know

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,369
from the Python environment that that

00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:53,720
will enable the dollar Python

00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:55,069
environment in the job for me to use so

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,019
i don't have to worry about the actual

00:14:55,069 --> 00:15:01,089
location of the Python interpreter on

00:14:57,019 --> 00:15:04,100
the resource and I specify my

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:06,230
application and an input argument

00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:10,369
because I want in this case on 12 26th

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:13,069
Fibonacci number in the list of

00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:15,139
executable files to my job i specify fit

00:15:13,069 --> 00:15:17,749
that pie because it's directly in the

00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:19,759
root of my make home directory and then

00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:22,519
some additional specs because I I know

00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:26,449
how approximately how much I need to run

00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:31,820
this girl and then I get the job result

00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:34,040
back and have a 26 the Fibonacci number

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,350
and it last time I can show you

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:42,080
afterwards actual Oh small like them

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:45,110
over it move on for now so if we go back

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,620
to the original vision for grid we had

00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:50,810
this important part about virtual of

00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:52,880
organizations so the point was that we

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,430
want people from different organizations

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,490
in the real world to be able to easily

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,740
collaborate for example it could be

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:02,630
people from different universities of

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,750
different companies working together on

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,780
a share project and we need some sorts

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:12,890
sort of means for actually enabling them

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,500
to collaborate in an efficient way so in

00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:20,570
Mick we try to implement that in the

00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:25,880
form of working for week we grits which

00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:28,490
enables users to dynamically sign up for

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,630
collaboration and share files share

00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:34,610
resources and they get access to private

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:37,370
and public web pages that you can use

00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:41,630
with the project and they have wiki

00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:43,550
wiki's and version control systems for

00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,310
if they want to develop code they might

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:48,890
want to collaborate on keeping track of

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:50,930
different versions and then that's a

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:55,670
small forum as well to each

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:57,320
communication internally an important

00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:59,960
aspect here is that we grits are

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:02,000
completely user managed so users all

00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,430
users in make can create their own V

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,740
grids and manage them that if sign up

00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:11,449
new users for them decide who owns a

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:14,150
week written who can control the

00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:16,939
vicarate and they can even make nested

00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:21,470
beiträge to get some sort of hierarchy

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:23,180
in the instruction here so I'm just

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,750
going to show you examples of heats of

00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:29,240
these features so on the vicarage page

00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,370
you can see at the bottom you create new

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,440
v grits and that's for anyone to do and

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,750
then at the top there's a the list of

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,690
all the available regrets and these

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,690
regrets that you see here are the ones

00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,340
some of the ones that I own and that

00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:46,550
automatically results in

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:48,950
full access for me to those regrets for

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,200
members who are not owners of these

00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:55,910
regrets you will only have access to

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:59,840
some of these features the ones that

00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:03,290
aren't related to actual administration

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,970
of the grid but most of the features so

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,590
you can do all the collaboration but if

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:08,600
you're only a member of the egret then

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:13,310
you can't decide who else is member of

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,690
the week for example if you are an owner

00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:17,150
of a meat bread you can go to the

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,010
administration page and decide whose

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:21,560
whose members was gonna have to be great

00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:23,990
you can decide with which resources can

00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:27,050
participate in the regrade that is which

00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:31,490
resources can take jobs from this

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:35,810
particular egret and at storage to brief

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:38,590
it just an example of a project using

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:43,190
the web page for for the recruit and

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:46,010
very competently and the same project

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:49,100
has a wiki for internal internal

00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:52,340
documentation that's the sort codes

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,280
source code repository where the

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:58,790
participants develop software after this

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,760
particular project and you can use the

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,220
web interface for for read-only access

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,830
this is a mercurial repository so this

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,800
is also Python and of course you can use

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,230
macule clients from your local computer

00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:15,740
to have so read and write access to the

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:19,070
repository and in that case you use your

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:22,490
make certificate with mercurial to get

00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:26,660
the same access control and just a

00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,970
sample of the liquid forum where you can

00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:33,230
communicate with other members of the

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:35,780
liquid finally you see the resources

00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,450
that are actually participating in this

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,970
we grid and you get all the stats and

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:45,350
see how long time ago that they actually

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:47,480
show up taking jobs okay so that was a

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,240
bit about the V grits the virtual

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,800
organizations and make so now I'll turn

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,980
to resources and make we have the

00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,110
different resource model

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:01,440
first of all we have a model which

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:04,640
resembles the one used in many grid

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,340
middleware and that is just classes and

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:12,030
supercomputers signing up for jobs in a

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,620
in a grid and in this case we just try

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,669
to make it a bit easier to sign up

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,980
because you don't have to install

00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:19,230
anything you just go to a web page and

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:22,770
enter your specs for the resource and

00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:24,870
then you can immediately use simple web

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:30,750
buttons to start and stuff resource and

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:34,250
make context this also enables resources

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:38,690
to deliver storage to particular egrets

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:41,820
in addition to just the computer power

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:45,059
later on we developed another model to

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:47,669
make it even simpler to contribute to to

00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:51,990
RIT because we've seen a lot of these

00:20:47,669 --> 00:20:53,490
say tie and folding at home buying all

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:58,200
these public resource computing

00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:02,250
initiatives where people can contribute

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:07,290
their spare compute cycles to compute

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:10,350
intensive projects so we developed a

00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:13,860
simple screensaver application that

00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:16,860
simply launches a virtual machine that

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,870
runs McResource in it so when the

00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,049
screensaver cakes in starts this virtual

00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:23,910
machine and then takes jobs when the use

00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:26,210
come back comes back to use his computer

00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:28,650
the virtual machines kills and any

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:31,380
running will be retried lay down

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:34,679
automatically so give them as an easy

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:37,110
way to let people contribute we made a

00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:40,020
live CD that allows us to put

00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:43,320
PlayStation 3's with the powerful cell

00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:45,570
processes on the grid and we did a proof

00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:47,730
of concept one-click resource model

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:50,700
where just you've use the Java Virtual

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,830
Machine and a browser to Goma a single

00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:56,549
web page and start contributing to

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:59,419
create when you have resources and make

00:21:56,549 --> 00:22:02,700
they will appear under the resources tab

00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:04,350
if you own the resources again you will

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,480
have access to administrating them

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,070
otherwise you can just view the specs

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,419
and

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:13,940
what resources are available when you

00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:16,669
actually own a resource and go to the

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,309
administration page you have this this

00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:23,200
is just a shortened form of the resource

00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:25,580
configuration but there's also a full

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,519
editing interface available where you

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,110
have a form that is a bit more user

00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:32,509
friendly to use when you want to specify

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,789
the specs for the resource and at the

00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:38,149
bottom you can see the axle control for

00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:39,799
this resource in relation to make you

00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:42,379
just hit the restart button here to

00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:47,419
start the resource and make and it will

00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:51,980
start taking jobs okay so as I started

00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:55,460
out mentioning we've seen this bus going

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:59,509
all the way to the cloud first of all we

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:02,929
had the buzz around grid and after many

00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:05,059
years of grid middleware development we

00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:10,580
kind of ended up with with middlewares

00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:14,240
that were well-suited for these very

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:16,220
specific purposes of handling jobs in

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,440
relation to for example high-energy

00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:22,370
physics where we had users that were

00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,620
quite knowledgeable about the underlying

00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,620
infrastructure and so on so they could

00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,419
use it and they still do that but it was

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,179
way too hard for ordinary users to just

00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:34,850
go on and use this for for an easy way

00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:38,809
to use with so we saw this this rise of

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,730
cloud happening and I'm not going too

00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,889
much into detail about this but you know

00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,169
probably know there are these the types

00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:47,990
of cloud definitions or software as a

00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,490
service we have web services platform as

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,409
a service where you have some kind of a

00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:55,159
kind of software stack that you built a

00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:57,799
web service up on and finally the low

00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:00,529
level infrastructure as a service where

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:03,710
you have some kind of virtualization so

00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:05,960
you get what resembles a bare metal

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:10,690
machine that you run your own entire

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:14,659
operating system on so how does that

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:21,599
come into play in relation to grid

00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:23,669
as we saw quit losing the hype because

00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:26,549
it's one more turned into what I would

00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:30,629
call a job shop where it didn't really

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:34,049
deliver anything else but the actual

00:24:30,629 --> 00:24:36,149
ways to interact with a lot of vets

00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,759
system around the world it didn't really

00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:41,549
deliver on the collaboration and the

00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,859
ease of use in any way so we saw users

00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:45,739
turn more and more to especially the

00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:48,359
cloud computing in the form of

00:24:45,739 --> 00:24:49,639
infrastructure as a service where people

00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:52,169
instead of using a grid middleware

00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:54,509
started deploying their own applications

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:57,450
to cloud infrastructures and staff and

00:24:54,509 --> 00:24:59,960
so you didn't have to worry about all

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:03,179
these grid intrinsics either simply just

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,330
build your own machine images and thrown

00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,159
onto the cloud use that and that that

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,200
works for people so it's pretty

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,239
pragmatic for people to choose that I

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,580
understand that but of course we would

00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:17,999
want to try to see if we can do both and

00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:23,159
actually still get all the collaboration

00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:27,210
and ease of use while keeping of course

00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:32,759
the pros from from both these very hyped

00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:34,799
and so with this cloud computing you you

00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:37,049
get you may get some resource sharing

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,019
because you may up end up having a

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:43,049
virtual virtual machines running on the

00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:46,019
same resources but it's not really as as

00:25:43,049 --> 00:25:50,669
a high level of sharing as you can get

00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:54,149
in the indicate where you don't have the

00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:58,049
overhead at the virtual machines and

00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:59,190
still Klopp is not that easy to use you

00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:02,369
still need to have some knowledge about

00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:06,210
actually filling your virtual machine

00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:09,869
images so we've tried to revive the

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:14,330
original vision of grit and we already

00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:17,219
think that we can deliver the basic

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,589
promises from the grid with our make

00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:22,830
Middle where we can share compute

00:26:19,589 --> 00:26:24,500
resources of all kinds including these

00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:27,900
public resource

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:29,640
computing resources we have ease of use

00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,040
everything can be done with a web

00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,770
interface and you don't have to worry

00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:37,580
about actual file locations in your job

00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:41,520
it's all a transparent and we do provide

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:44,420
especially important these regrets that

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,850
enables easy collaboration with

00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:51,330
workflows and communication and that

00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:55,140
were part of the original vision but

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:57,240
still we see the movement to clout so we

00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,730
thought well perhaps we can try to learn

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,790
from some of the pros that we've seen in

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:05,460
cloud and even integrate those ideas and

00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:09,270
make as well to make it even more

00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:12,870
complete so first of all why did people

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:15,570
start to use cloud in such a big fashion

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:18,059
and one of the things that we saw was

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:19,950
that it was simply too hard to get

00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:22,799
access to the software that you wanted

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,860
to run on the grid so people always

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,990
ended up having to manually contact the

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,640
system administrator and listen resource

00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:33,179
and say can you please install this

00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:35,970
software for me and maybe it's 500

00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:38,520
megabytes of software that the

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:44,669
administrator doesn't have any clue

00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:47,960
about what does and that's always a no

00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:50,669
I'll not do that so we need some way of

00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,870
making that easier to to work around

00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:57,059
that then we thought another one of the

00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,700
points of cloud is that you can actually

00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,679
have these web services and have the

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:05,030
application platform you make it easy

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,100
easy for users to use an application and

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:11,280
through the web and maybe we do

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:14,720
something as well and finally for the

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:16,710
case where we can't we still can't be

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,750
solved the problem of software

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:20,790
deployment then perhaps we could turn to

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:25,980
virtual machines to and integrate that

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:30,900
in the grid so first of all

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:34,660
on the better software sharing approach

00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:36,640
we took a look at how things were and we

00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,250
saw well we did have the runtime

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,630
environments in place but wait they were

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,040
not always that easy to use because

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,800
because administrators still have to

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,020
manually control applications on their

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:52,450
resources but perhaps we could make a

00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:55,140
system that would allow dynamic

00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:58,570
deployment of software to the resources

00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:01,090
so we decided to go for central software

00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:03,220
repository where we've packaged some

00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:06,520
software and made it easy to deployed

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:10,270
that software onto the resources in this

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:14,740
case we found the brilliant python-based

00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:17,740
cyril install packaging system which

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,200
actively fits our purpose yes perfectly

00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,040
because it's a framework that allows

00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,470
anybody to package up software you can

00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,480
do dynamic deployment because a software

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:32,380
package is pretty much just an XML file

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,170
pointing to an archive somewhere on the

00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,850
internet and what 0 install does

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,630
internally is instead of actually

00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:43,440
installing in the

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:46,470
so I simplify this post was hot pot down

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,170
into the user account starts cash and

00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:53,670
everything is longer whiscash it will

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:56,740
happen here super privileged privileged

00:29:53,670 --> 00:30:00,150
law though want anything

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:04,960
space we get automatic identity handling

00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:06,540
updates the themes of warfare isolate

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:12,970
software and certainly

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:16,510
the ashes to me show them Socrates this

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:21,610
happened with this process in the ways

00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:25,360
of Exeter that uses package soft rock in

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:27,370
the software repository just put some

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,190
around the internet and then any

00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:32,560
resources that want to enable users to

00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:38,169
use this as your article agnese this

00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:50,449
leads us all single 0 so package small

00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:55,909
and that will allow to do you think

00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:57,829
about what I ask an Asian platform thank

00:30:55,909 --> 00:31:00,259
you what do you think about already has

00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:02,779
important to that because Lisa private

00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,839
and public web pages a wide variety of

00:31:02,779 --> 00:31:09,289
their peepers can be useful this

00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:13,699
particular Paris anybody in the regrade

00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:17,440
can actually build their own application

00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:20,930
patient using

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,340
pages when we provide sending township

00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:29,770
library they can use to babysit who

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,770
actually spell oriented house plots

00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,480
finally we did some experiments virtual

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,480
machines

00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,030
virtual machine control

00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:54,360
practice recently who's participated

00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,929
g image

00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:14,559
pnc displayed running and workarounds up

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,190
contacting the resource to actually

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,190
maintain this

00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:30,210
even easy on emotion trying to use is

00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:36,350
this we provide SSB access to the music

00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:36,350
rooms and also lapses or temple

00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:44,320
h as mountain

00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,320
the files but as they flee

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,830
ok

00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:56,679
no mags a big technical details me here

00:32:55,129 --> 00:33:00,639
as you

00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:06,759
long as this web page at the web server

00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:14,529
and we have different in the bases I see

00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:17,379
God along c so that users can use MSM

00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:21,100
nemeth's running background actually and

00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:23,669
without these needles and the CIA whole

00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,669
run spike

00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:31,910
chef my parents

00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:33,910
so I try to

00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,910
I

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:41,470
or worse so what we want to reuse as

00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:45,590
much as we can so at least chef packets

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:50,990
and then we just wrap all the input

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:53,050
products on CGI holo see and when we

00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:56,620
have

00:33:53,050 --> 00:34:02,030
safe put it in the dictionary

00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:05,000
Locationary i read it on the dictionary

00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:07,130
sentence of Baggins which can then do

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,630
the hammock and his records files and

00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:12,500
frank with

00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:14,510
running there don't like the people want

00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:21,680
you very much because the sickness

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:26,090
dictionary and look I and returns a list

00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:28,160
of dictionaries can simply take that

00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,810
list you know if you are using a

00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:35,120
something so obviously you just see that

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:38,210
this missionaries or form and in the

00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:41,150
case we want to display some HTML web

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:50,260
pages we have offered endless that take

00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:50,260
a list and that agent this

00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,920
we wish

00:34:55,369 --> 00:35:04,390
as I mentioned in relation to be rich

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,390
and opponents use my 14

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:19,750
these cases we have used the CGI version

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:24,640
is that simple see I examples

00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:28,550
bonus so we actually sold as individual

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:34,270
stories and he's in to be great

00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:34,270
directories receive all their old files

00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:44,990
directory structure then I am this

00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:47,950
forest war forum which is probably

00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,950
unknown

00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:59,790
I alongside one was

00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:08,630
just

00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:10,690
and 50

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,690
I

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,800
uses actually that's

00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,770
about I only actually

00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:33,269
access your territory

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:40,510
as it to be

00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:44,660
so was wonderful SSH module

00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:48,250
there's next implements ssh python we

00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:50,220
feel the features of the SH and as I

00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:54,290
drumless single

00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:58,050
and the organ providers was example

00:36:54,290 --> 00:37:00,750
server so what we have to lose

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:04,730
integrated with Nick was he in some ways

00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:08,700
to use the authentication authorization

00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:13,290
and some ways a map to our making films

00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:16,080
so what we did was we decided to have

00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:20,750
users provide their own SSH but we key

00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:24,450
in that we copy and so they make

00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:29,280
reservations as a biography you lucky

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:32,849
and accessories but we need to make sure

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,340
that the users can only access them they

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:39,359
should not be allowed to access our

00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:44,940
users and they need to be able to access

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:48,780
these e great chef the referees does it

00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:51,119
was very going on this is not that

00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,520
difficult to do is just needs to a

00:37:51,119 --> 00:38:01,480
crisis mature access

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,480
then we have a thing for you siblings

00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:10,250
philosophy with Jedi rector easton PA

00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:13,540
tylenol you know when we just see this

00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:16,480
yet rach recess morning Emily erasures

00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:19,700
acid

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,610
of course we also call it uses tampering

00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,570
to muscle

00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:26,040
so

00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:29,160
they could create siblings

00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:32,670
los taxes

00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,880
and we just to make soy people shooting

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,880
themselves

00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,299
this means that

00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,710
do I have time to go

00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:07,250
which was outlines the way we avoid

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:10,609
installing software active resources the

00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:13,819
NS a-- generate scripts make service

00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:16,760
push the optical resources using SCP

00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:30,280
then we execute those scripts is a

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:33,280
message and we don't actually sold

00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,280
wassup

00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:44,550
since this is a Python conference

00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:50,810
attendees and our experiences are

00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:53,560
fighting what games can say this

00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:53,560
amazing

00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:20,850
zoella and Big E us on such projects mr.

00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:35,970
Belton adult very quick assets and it's

00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:37,770
not this time that's millions of lines

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:42,600
of code

00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:46,580
yes at the point also makes it a lot

00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:56,220
easier to maintain get into

00:40:46,580 --> 00:41:02,079
because yeah especially happy we have

00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:06,710
this very easy flexible structure

00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:13,700
and vision end up using dictionaries and

00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:15,940
people said database pedal pushers like

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:22,230
Wade Davis with

00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:22,230
what is satisfied with his evolutionary

00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,569
and lastly I won't mention this side of

00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,460
thing that I mentioned about having died

00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:34,990
had module that share with you

00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:38,290
places and was very easy

00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:42,380
still have these flexible

00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:44,540
performance this screen flawless even

00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,480
see

00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:49,990
volunteers

00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,990
yes

00:41:53,600 --> 00:42:01,840
okay so at this point we try to focus on

00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,840
anything

00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:34,240
I my novella most main concern

00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:42,490
it is Anthony some civilizing

00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:42,490
performance that made

00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:49,190
frameworks come into service

00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:59,600
four actually

00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:59,600
sending the Swiss to

00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:05,030
back

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,030
well that's it

00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:25,470
the solution

00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:41,990
and you can use pine assignment module

00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:41,990
you still need to provide Ospreys

00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:46,110
difficult

00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:52,180
come father

00:43:56,349 --> 00:43:59,349
email

00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:02,839
the output

00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:11,480
space

00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:14,830
our principal

00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,830
and if you know as possible to build

00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,830
items

00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:24,840
but to sum up where we are now

00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:34,010
view feature complete ribbon where you

00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,010
can do all things

00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,579
all things

00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:47,310
it's related to the loser

00:44:47,730 --> 00:45:04,960
so group my taxable x.x

00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,960
wheelchair

00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:08,849
different realities

00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:13,810
for the resource giving and

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:19,400
the leaves

00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:25,910
virtual machines and then we have knee

00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:31,280
brace for this duration and resolve some

00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:33,940
locations web pages we focused something

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,579
focused someone

00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,579
zero so that should be pretty easy

00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:49,359
so what's left rose so far has been

00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:53,840
three months of research project Pat big

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:56,510
production sighs and keeping us busy

00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:00,310
with their production they do have

00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:00,310
production self-abuse

00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:13,400
research projects come and exhale and

00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:16,280
was that much in relation to actually

00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:19,630
get performance

00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,630
a service

00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,060
and that's what I had

00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,260
questions

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,970
um my over half spends a long time

00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,670
ashes

00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,420
00:46:58,670 --> 00:47:03,600
nice

00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:07,310
but how much how much at least you do

00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:07,310
sort of junior level users

00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:21,029
well as you might have seen from the

00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:30,519
first idea my official associations now

00:47:21,029 --> 00:47:33,160
this experience but now remove the bits

00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:36,759
closer to the businesses and we do run

00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,739
projects to try to get more users clean

00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:44,619
it with ease ease and interfaces and

00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:47,939
getting to know about things that

00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:47,939
shouldn't be so

00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,400
yep picture

00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:07,070
it was a question

00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:14,069
that you want in here

00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:19,740
precious for licensed handling so quite

00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:21,900
sensitive simulation colors are things

00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:28,910
like that requires a commercial license

00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:31,559
and availability of revising saw it's my

00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:34,670
experiences usually our problems it's

00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:34,670
not easy to tackle

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,080
can you you do try to cover that is fit

00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:53,090
and it as well one of the things that we

00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:57,830
saw practice was a in relation to a

00:48:53,090 --> 00:49:01,610
matlab assume if we have this case where

00:48:57,830 --> 00:49:07,160
you have people choose to have a

00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:11,110
compatible that they share because in

00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:14,330
relations to Isis and in this particular

00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:16,550
in the particular case that the actual

00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:19,700
application platform are shown here is

00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:22,070
about that couple application so all the

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:25,610
users of this be bred chose can go to

00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:28,250
this patient portal submit the malecon

00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:31,220
it will automatically be sent we sent to

00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:34,700
the compilation post with the license

00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,670
then hit the compiled version bags of a

00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:39,380
poem and then they can send it off to a

00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:42,130
resources where they don't need the full

00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:44,570
license I think we need some more time

00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:47,960
at least it needs one sack software

00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:50,800
though but you get around the license

00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,800
issued by doing this

00:49:56,609 --> 00:50:01,289
well which licenses

00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:15,410
minimum Georgian Griffiths ppl two and

00:50:07,550 --> 00:50:15,410
three you some coronas that is the your

00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:21,380
at least

00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:35,880
so when user submits a jumper there's

00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:38,040
also to specify those houses that means

00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,280
going to use and what happens if there's

00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:43,589
it is not good for sup going says it's

00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:49,160
too low and takes a lot of time on it is

00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:49,160
to be heat occupies those horses come on

00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:57,059
and first of all if you specify best

00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:59,099
resources up and what you do what you

00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:01,640
need for the job and you typically end

00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:06,890
up having the local resource Philly girl

00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:06,890
when it has used all the music you

00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:13,859
it depends on actual resource the usual

00:51:11,309 --> 00:51:17,400
thing is that the batch system running

00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:19,589
on the resource that we say that's one

00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:22,709
case if you're on their own and specify

00:51:19,589 --> 00:51:28,079
too many resources that is not really a

00:51:22,709 --> 00:51:31,289
big deal the only thing that will result

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:34,829
in the schedule or make a lot of time

00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:36,239
planning for you and you may have may

00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:38,789
end up having the job wait longer

00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:41,390
because well as a way for a super

00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:41,390
careful

00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:45,420
past opportunity

00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:58,180
you mentioned that one of the reasons

00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:01,150
people were moving from grid computing

00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:04,119
with the cloud was that you could put on

00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:10,930
your own image and you talked a lot

00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:14,589
about do resource management software

00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:16,390
that from using it I know the reason

00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:18,339
that you built this is because no one

00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:21,160
likes having their job failed because

00:52:18,339 --> 00:52:23,040
they missed out something in their

00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:26,170
environmental variables things like that

00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,750
maybe this is naive but would it not be

00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:31,170
possible to instead of uploading a

00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:34,390
virtual machine to be able to specify

00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:36,160
these things to the grid then download

00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:42,700
something that would allow you to verify

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:44,970
that your jump would impact work that's

00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:47,650
an actual able to point out of the

00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:51,490
virtual machine project we did they're

00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:53,920
actually focused on specifying when you

00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:57,160
wanted in your virtual machine is the

00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,960
list of software packages then you could

00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,869
download virtual machine finish

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,210
generated normally you could even start

00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:07,750
your application freeze it that send it

00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:12,940
to me that precede run sunday resource

00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:15,130
and then pull back Mitchell

00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:18,670
these students are working with a pretty

00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:21,329
neat things activity that so I really

00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:26,890
look forward to getting that integrated

00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:29,819
version because the ETA I started

00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:34,500
working on earlier this month but

00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:41,070
unfortunately the guy collected

00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:41,070
this out with the Romans for how to get

00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:50,130
I'm only for what Western more the 11

00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,130
has better person

00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:58,340
and what about the security on the

00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:01,580
bottom

00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:08,900
Oh season to complex on so the Tennessee

00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:09,980
Titans and PLO some peas I mean if

00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:14,980
you're thinking right here sir

00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:14,980
securities I mean about using that

00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:24,670
okay okay yeah so we have we have a

00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:27,520
revocation of funds to make a backup of

00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:33,299
the user homes but when you send fast to

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:37,960
resources then their make takes care of

00:54:33,299 --> 00:54:40,990
15 monoculars moving in fast method of

00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:42,750
course you could have resource if they

00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:45,690
have privileges taken

00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:49,220
and monitor all files in the resource

00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:49,220
need to do some backup

00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:58,480
sorry but the time is over we have steel

00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:01,020
five minutes before the south when

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,020
estonia

00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,720
