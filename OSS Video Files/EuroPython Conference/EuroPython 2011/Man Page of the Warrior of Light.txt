sao paulo clearly written collection of

00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,019
essays they I dunno as many of you know

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:29,810
for him but he's a liberated Brazilian

00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:32,300
officer and he has written this

00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:35,720
collection Restless title and many of

00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:37,730
the warrior of light and the the

00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,870
collection analysis is structured a

00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:46,040
series of directives a hypothetical and

00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:50,420
very white faces and these directives

00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:54,020
are accompanied by explanations the

00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:57,410
block contains many paradoxes and I've

00:00:54,020 --> 00:01:01,280
just shown two directives from the novel

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:03,530
and sometimes were white behaves like a

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,530
rock at the same time he has also

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:12,049
qualities of water and yet not sure and

00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:18,170
on this in the sorcerer it might not

00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:21,020
work and so the these directives are

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:25,219
conflicting as I said and it's very hard

00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:28,310
to apply them land water and rock are

00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:31,039
given opposite and as opposite metaphors

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:35,630
intelligent for instance rock is

00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:38,509
stronger than water or is it water is

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:42,139
weak but uncertain time scale if power

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:45,619
is absolute and as my music CDs to say

00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:48,889
it's not the water that where the stone

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:53,149
is what at what frequency of falling and

00:01:48,889 --> 00:01:56,299
so and when I was reading the the

00:01:53,149 --> 00:01:58,369
surface I get very excited if there was

00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:59,100
something like that only for computer

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:03,890
programmer

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:07,140
and so we're set of rules to follow and

00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,179
it's very hard to apply them in the mix

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,520
many of the case of the paradoxes and

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,430
this is why it's hard to become weary of

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,980
life is because you strike just the

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,069
right balance sometimes and this is

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,380
where the scale of ice and so we find

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:26,280
this balance of forces in many places

00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:31,530
and in real life and varying games

00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,860
evolution computing and the forces is

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,410
playing poker for instance and

00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:41,370
value-based and deceptive played those

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:44,430
who play poker know that in fact clerics

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,890
of equal skill meet in place value on

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:50,370
long enough enough time scale no one

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,560
that will make any money and the two

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,510
game of poker twice in alternating

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,810
between value based in this active way

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,910
just right knowing the opponent and and

00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,580
that's that's what game poker is all

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,390
about as far as the board game go is

00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,459
concerned the forces is like hearing our

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:13,440
offense and defense so the the curve of

00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:17,670
the point of the game is to capture

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:22,560
territory and the amount of territory

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,290
you seek and as should be adjusted to

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,260
the your skill level and sea level of

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:31,019
your opponent because if you're too

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,540
ambitious you will not have the strength

00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,700
to defend the territories and if you are

00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:39,780
too conservative you will not have in

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,299
our territory to win and so so this how

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,570
quickly a listener is recurring cotton

00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:48,629
here and I'm going to discuss what are

00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:52,989
the forces at play in competing

00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:56,620
so and to do the sciences with many

00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:59,110
other fields the problems to solve and

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:01,810
there is more than one way of solving in

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,180
trouble usually and if we consider the

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:09,430
whole hypothetical space of problems and

00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:11,680
do this verse but hypothetically and the

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:14,739
the solutions are point in this

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,930
multi-dimensional space it is all to the

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,630
projections in that I want certain

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:24,120
dimensions that we value and the

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:28,210
dimensions are that I've used are

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:32,560
readable and cryptic and then flexible

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:35,200
and rigid in simple and complex and most

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,470
of the time we want to stay towards one

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:41,310
end of these we prefer more readable

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:46,260
solutions we prefer more flexible and

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:48,880
simplest solutions but sometimes as well

00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:54,460
we just want to strike the right balance

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:57,789
between the two and the values are this

00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:01,479
is taken from Lyon condec book on

00:04:57,789 --> 00:05:03,310
implementation portents where he arrived

00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,680
at communication for stability and

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,930
simplicity are the cornerstones in this

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,780
foundation of any good programming

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:14,470
button and by communication he means

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:17,530
here how well vehicle dreams flexible

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:18,639
solutions are easy to move into slightly

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,060
different once these new requirements

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:26,169
coming in simple solutions are easier to

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:30,789
maintain so I as well Alex Matheny said

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:33,190
in his keynote in Monday it's very

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,919
frequently and carefully in litigation

00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:38,440
between two extremes is but sometimes

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,630
it's slightly blurred this area and

00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:45,210
there is there are more possibilities

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:50,000
so to my mind is these are all

00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:53,330
simplicity's in these guys and and the

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,040
flexibility is just implicitly of

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,550
adapting the system to future needs and

00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:04,790
that communication is the simplicity of

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:07,740
learning how the system works and we can

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:11,630
each pick your cursor in their pocket

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,090
and reclaim ins and UNIX philosophy

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:18,090
original design rocks and RZA and non

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:20,430
exhaustive list here but if you if you

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,150
look at each in single one of them

00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:27,000
closely you'll see that they all recipes

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:30,360
how to give in the situation arrive the

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,430
most simple solution possible and like

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,680
we want America teaches us to the other

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,660
systems out of small components with

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,440
clean interfaces connecting them and

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:42,600
clarity a communication composition is

00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:45,360
that a rule of the delay is why the

00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:48,120
program level it is us to write programs

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,460
that work well with other programs by a

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:56,390
textual interfaces and simplicity's has

00:06:53,460 --> 00:07:00,680
been discussed through of separation and

00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:03,210
teaches us in place and different

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,419
sections of our code let alone different

00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,570
time scales in two different places so

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:14,370
that the code is it all from the same

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:16,650
times carries local interface and

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,270
personally teaches us out of all

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:21,930
possible solution is like regularization

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:26,260
in semantics we want the simplest

00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:28,750
solution possible that does the job and

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:30,910
it goes on their books and patterns

00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,430
Michael apartments implementation

00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:37,930
buttons and the question I'd like to ask

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:40,060
is why this is so hard does being a good

00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:43,810
programmer essentially equate to

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:46,360
learning millions of rows and applying

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,930
them in various situations as this

00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,730
situations arise or and a or the

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,910
response an outfit can be done in and

00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:58,540
how do we consciously become better

00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:01,990
programmers what do we do and I hope I

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:06,670
out try an answer from others and this

00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:08,970
in the what mode comes so something says

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,080
know your enemy and know yourself and

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,770
we're going to spend some time and

00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,860
you're in a bit about our enemies and

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:20,290
then the know is so personal for so

00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:22,690
simplicity and the opposite of

00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:25,630
complexity is frequently associated with

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:29,110
beauty clarity purity there is an

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:31,660
instant connection with choose here come

00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:36,220
rape razortail the simplest solutions is

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,650
usually the most likely they are in

00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:41,400
definition that relate simplicity to

00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:44,590
come to perfection harmony and elegance

00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:47,950
in interesting thing here and always

00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:50,920
there the beauty exists in the eye of

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:54,880
the observer simplicity usually exists

00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:56,620
in the content light in mind and people

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,760
can centralize things in different ways

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,780
and this is why it's hard to operate

00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,030
with simplicity and religion either has

00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:10,330
review of this and prefers to simply

00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:12,310
excuse not easy and the reasons I think

00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:17,160
it's not better techniques key is not

00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,690
easy because we need high level view and

00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,120
not everybody has the time to have a

00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:24,430
high level view to find the simplest

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,470
possible solution that does the job need

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,980
to know the whole space of solutions and

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,020
this is a simplicity of genius someone

00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,240
who can

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:38,040
capture the whole space and single out

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,500
the ones that really shine it is a hard

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,080
problem and of course to make flexible

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,510
systems we need to know the space of

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,210
problems what problems are likely to be

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,900
so next and that ridiculous is like

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:54,570
predicting future is hard and sometimes

00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,690
it's helpful to define a description

00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:01,500
framework before attempting to solve a

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:03,630
problem and this this is where some of

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:08,400
it implies they can be put into then the

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:11,100
solution presents itself and this is the

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:18,270
subject of domain-specific languages and

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:19,710
a bit of an art so before i come to a

00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:23,340
concurrent definition that i'm going to

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:27,050
use an x is going to show some famous

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:32,400
people quotes and on the subject and the

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:34,350
norman and the user interfaces world

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,060
with an interesting blog entry i

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:40,830
encourage you see there is quite

00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:43,650
pragmatic and ii his point of view is

00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:46,860
basically people buy products that have

00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:48,840
more features of laughs and it's not

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:50,220
because they fix or more complex

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,050
products is because of the point of

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,440
purchase most of them don't know they

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,020
need and therefore to accommodate for

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,930
that program they want the most complex

00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:04,230
product whether they make sure thing is

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:07,350
satisfied one less familiar and that

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,620
inverse of the popular topics are very

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:13,320
very simple in the face and the

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:15,750
suspension and it kind of popular just

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,880
because of this yeah exactly by this

00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,770
time our are doing many search engines

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,420
available and tickle knew what they

00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,180
value is already if you find something

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,640
you never ever interacted with and you

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:30,690
didn't have time to learn the product

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,640
you it will bite it really wanted that

00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:37,290
seems like that has more features and

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,480
that's easy i happen to agree with it in

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,389
this context

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:47,290
to medical attention was drawn to this

00:11:43,389 --> 00:11:49,660
and he recorded complexity is highly

00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,309
related to and he did not contradict the

00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,489
Norman he says that complexity

00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:57,309
simplicity are the sides of the coin and

00:11:54,489 --> 00:12:00,850
one cannot be valid with low the other

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:03,009
sometimes we want complexity and it's

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:08,350
quite philosophical he is a graphics

00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:11,319
designer and then we have Einstein I've

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:16,540
cups or even go through the same meal

00:12:11,319 --> 00:12:19,600
the unsigned razor yeah and until this

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:22,749
ain't exactly recruited more practically

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,639
that protection finality not when there

00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:31,389
is nothing left glad but when there is

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,829
nothing to take away and drop paradoxes

00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:36,100
as well that simplicity is the ultimate

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:37,689
sophistication which is too because we

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,579
need to know the whole space of

00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:44,290
solutions and I either writer simplest

00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:48,040
way to chips at least is to reduce

00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:50,799
thoughtfully well for full reduction to

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,809
me the exercise in higher mental

00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,480
faculties which is not a simple process

00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:57,639
so there are paradoxes here so the

00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:01,540
definition that I'm going to use is by

00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:04,240
Victoria visually and that complexity is

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,369
a measure of the resources expended by

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,110
the system while interacting with a

00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,809
piece of software to performing in desk

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:13,569
the this definition is quite general it

00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,850
captures systems of a computer and

00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:18,040
programmer at the same time so it's

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:21,939
computer than a given task is

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,559
computation and it's a programmer at the

00:13:21,939 --> 00:13:29,199
interaction with the program code in

00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:33,040
debug intestines so I looked up some

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:35,139
definitions of complexity and a fall

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,350
into three categories

00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:41,709
one of them is how many tokens the Rhino

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:46,059
program the other one is how your

00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:49,269
program falls into part and the third

00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:51,669
one is how the information flows through

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,350
your program simply the complexity

00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:57,069
measures are basically functions to this

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:59,559
and three things and the creators of

00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:02,649
these Anakin policy measures I happen to

00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:04,749
agree that if they are very difficult to

00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,429
compare and interpret some time the

00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:08,679
two-goal level sometimes they've done

00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:12,119
take into account the domain specific

00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:15,249
language side of the story and sometimes

00:14:12,119 --> 00:14:17,019
we want comes in flight in mind in the

00:14:15,249 --> 00:14:21,850
complexity measures well it's really

00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:26,739
hard to get into so function on the last

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:30,339
for instance as body twice as long as a

00:14:26,739 --> 00:14:32,439
function on the right and the both

00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:36,910
functions can accept three parameters

00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:39,939
and returned a single one so I'm showing

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:45,639
this because I want to get a feel for

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:47,980
what it is to see unknown code and gas

00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,540
complexity so here it wasn't from a

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,449
distance and didn't see the actual

00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:55,899
implementation only at all that the body

00:14:52,449 --> 00:15:00,009
of the function worth is longer and my

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:02,399
question to the audience is and how much

00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:05,529
do you think the function on the left

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:10,720
how its complexity relates the function

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:15,069
on the right foot ok we have one answer

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:19,649
can help any any more suggestions of the

00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:21,940
same thing we don't know

00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:25,000
but in which day she doesn't sound

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,820
relevant well we love regardless of what

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,779
they do we still can ring them in

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,820
complexity right so a government sorry

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:36,190
I'm relating consent to be back for

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,079
publicity so right we're right okay so

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,930
but this is all the information any

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,850
given any other repeat of the same

00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:48,490
programa like well I mean at the moment

00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,250
it's local Scouts right you didn't see

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,260
anything else outside so this is all

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:57,820
with it on the information you're given

00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:01,870
really go in right ok so the shorter one

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:04,870
seems simpler and the can you tell by

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:17,410
how much simpler this is it twice as

00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:19,180
simple is it sweet i'm simple or what if

00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,370
I guess what I'm trying to ask you if

00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,920
you if you like to consider all the

00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:26,230
space of all possible functions that you

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,140
might need include base and then you

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:32,350
average over all of them what is its

00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:36,130
kind of feeling again usually they think

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:44,310
of it like the explanation the size of

00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:48,699
our country of like that hmm ok so what

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:52,750
it is like they write again you ready so

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:55,600
another example threads two identical

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,420
functions that are almost one that

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,180
contain my nexus two parameters and the

00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:05,380
other one except three parameters how

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,809
they complexities relate to people right

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,579
offenders employed but i'm more

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:13,449
interested in how the complexity grows

00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:15,520
with these things so if you were to

00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,169
express we complexity of the function on

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,790
the right in terms of complexity of this

00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,300
function on the left what would the

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:25,120
relationship be

00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:29,870
that's like twice okay okay so the

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:33,130
definition I've used the over complexity

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:40,040
here is a entering the forest metric and

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:43,130
they laser pointer think so okay so they

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,130
say complexity according to them is

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,920
proportional to the number of lines of

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:52,180
code and a program you need function

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:55,640
subroutine that procedure has times the

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,360
number of inputs it accepts x number of

00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,250
outputs except square and the i think

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,670
there is a good action also that that

00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:06,440
they will even complex world where main

00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:10,400
entities interact with each other and

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:17,140
the way ankles can interact without put

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:19,970
girls squarely like matrix and the

00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,280
number of lines of code is a very good

00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:23,900
measure as well so later and there's a

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:26,150
complexity so according to the air

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,140
measure of complexity this function on

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:32,060
the right is actually a more than half

00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:35,180
more complex than function on the left

00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:39,800
in here and one is twice as complex to

00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,840
the other if nothing else is said so

00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:46,490
next example is taken from came back and

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:54,050
we have two functions which one do you

00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:56,350
prefer more and why ok we have a an

00:18:54,050 --> 00:19:00,260
opinion that function on on the Left

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:03,650
preferable white because there's a lot

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:06,260
who are they there is second role of me

00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:08,090
okay and I don't know what get up

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,900
actually many please call it into

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:16,220
account okay aloe vera you need any of

00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:19,770
us but you know is how the body

00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:22,590
depositing good right solution is better

00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,950
because they at least we calculate in

00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:29,070
the South Pacific of environment and i'm

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:37,320
using matter what the cause of stories

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:41,490
for me because we we remove the libel

00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:45,330
our very natural insert and have it be a

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,640
member and industry i think the lesson

00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:50,070
West because counter is the global

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,980
variable in this example if it was a

00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:56,730
local bar or I could prolly agree with

00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:03,660
you let's have a low output what I

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:05,640
wanted more opinions because function on

00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:09,510
the left because infirmities a concept

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:13,860
that is an ass director in Atlanta so

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:16,080
incremental whatever not as a single

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:21,420
very well in any case it is increment

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:25,470
mr. a completely different abstraction

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:31,070
rather than G now imagine you available

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:35,730
in feminist consciousness propor-

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:40,260
something therefore these making

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,510
molecules resembling a check well then

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,670
how do you normally explore non code

00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:48,330
base by the first book I gave it's a

00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:51,120
sequel Boscovich you go to be the header

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:53,370
files right and you know given given

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,320
information goes to the highway London

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,929
you descend right so I mean here it

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,660
doesn't qualify anything off but there

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:03,450
is some information after here to to

00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,770
stay in the preference I think so in his

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:11,390
opinion we function on the right is

00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:16,610
better and the reason is that the

00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:19,950
the naming of the other entities here

00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:23,070
the level of concreteness of this

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,830
statement is way higher than the input

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:29,910
and output is of the repair an

00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:34,980
inconsistency there but after our

00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:38,040
algorithms so then there is this example

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:42,500
where level of concreteness is the same

00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:42,500
but if anyone prefers

00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:19,190
it works we just with pretty obvious

00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:19,190
right better because of your penguin

00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:32,220
tonight's objective is obvious that one

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,799
that'll be called holy help something an

00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,230
increment count out almost nothing

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:51,559
because it don't know what I count or

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:55,980
why anyone losing idea in tsukino it yet

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:58,590
couldn't it be from the point of view

00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,700
from programs we would like to be in for

00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:08,730
myself and people who wear with numbers

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:11,340
would like tell em to me can't I

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:23,309
pinheiro more mindful that you have one

00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:25,530
more operations doing okay I think I was

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:28,679
a highly finish something will change

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:32,900
the legislation around like to their the

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:32,900
line so they don't have internet yet

00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:41,250
very good thank you very much so the

00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,910
last opinions happen to agree with 10

00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:47,010
tracks and the inconsistency in a min on

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:48,870
the right because input and output are

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,640
named after what they do an internet

00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:53,370
account it may not be an implementation

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,950
so there is a discrepancy here West

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:59,040
alley there is a better name in this

00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:01,720
context so we have two classes the

00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:03,730
implement head process and delete and

00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:13,350
doesn't want to implement that process

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:13,350
and we hide my connection keeps me

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:25,620
laughing every move don't ever mention

00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:25,620
and who are wiser just be calm language

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:32,200
yes so another pinion words are from

00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:36,040
gentleman in blue shirt and the

00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:42,370
counterpart of Ed is that we move my

00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:45,970
correct yeah okay well so the

00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:47,530
counterpart of deleted create and I have

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:50,050
a discussion with someone else before

00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:53,380
and that we arrived create and destroy

00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:59,110
is confronted by three so but you in

00:24:53,380 --> 00:25:01,450
both right a toddler's monetise I would

00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:05,140
say this review is translating would

00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:07,510
have projects aim for something from

00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:13,480
something we're just really like that

00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:15,670
about and that's what this ominous is to

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,070
sponsor a living in an era when we give

00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:21,210
it to be logical decision of each

00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:23,980
forgive us ellery who are different

00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:29,040
anything any different context but those

00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:33,760
beasts or remove south in the saddle but

00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,490
heavy never be specifically adapted to

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:38,730
its concept as a wire need to remove if

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:42,440
you use a burden from a different

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:47,700
dictionary from differences in

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:55,740
the original meaning it please can have

00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:58,620
a completely different meanings yeah so

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:01,170
I think the correct answer was already

00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,810
stated and according to came back anyway

00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:05,820
so very the symmetry image and a delete

00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:08,370
implies complete destruction of the

00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,830
object which area does not have that

00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:14,040
does not have a communication who is

00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:18,930
creation and therefore aired and renew a

00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:21,240
better and counterpart the play mode

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:25,470
where the mind about delete versus

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,080
revocable urgency so now three pieces of

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:32,310
collision actually how mine is doing on

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:35,370
time and I ski this is that right okay

00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:37,350
so any opinions and which one do you

00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,840
prefer and why I'm going to take few

00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:47,190
because I need to make sure we move in

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:51,780
the right way so any second the patient

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:55,920
was called the second one we call it the

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:58,530
strata after almost the solvent and even

00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,690
if an expansion happens it will flow to

00:26:58,530 --> 00:27:04,310
the five again in the even work with

00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,310
Piper experience

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:12,809
the new love my tonic right secondly the

00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:14,400
most ironic an opinion so I don't have I

00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:19,340
don't happen to have a strong opinion on

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:25,530
this but the reason complexity can be

00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:27,660
explicit and implicit and the bottom one

00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,750
tells exactly what what is happening

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,299
where the this one you need to know will

00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:38,970
statement to actually know what is that

00:27:33,299 --> 00:27:40,830
we need to know yeah so there it's an

00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,990
evolution but most people for instance

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,790
learn the first one right when they

00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:46,559
learn poison and then they realize it

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,809
doesn't actually guarantee you at my

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,240
hand with file handler can be returned

00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:54,270
to the operating system and sometimes it

00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,980
can pay off if this executive often so

00:27:54,270 --> 00:28:00,770
and then with statements was introduced

00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:04,350
you so so that my point here is that

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:06,990
this operation may complexity or just

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:11,360
shuffled around it didn't go anywhere it

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:15,030
wouldn't create it or remove to just

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:18,150
some statement not a bit of statement

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:20,130
and doesn't do is it at all the bottom

00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:23,040
one is very explicit about what it does

00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:25,460
and the limit of 1 upon 1 has another

00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:31,980
problem it shouldn't be excited to be

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:37,220
vitally okay I guess difference very

00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:37,220
good sir so next

00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:55,070
okay then the first and white oh ok so

00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:59,870
the first is preferred because its

00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:02,630
shortest it's also more pie funny and in

00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:08,780
the the police comprehensive we're bored

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:11,570
from costco academy but ok so it's

00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:17,830
expressing things more mathematically

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:21,260
it's more readable as well as 20 meters

00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:28,820
well where you can end if you lots of

00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:31,130
you in there I think then so I would say

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:33,980
that the first one is more declarative

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,360
than the the other one because they're

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,680
at the bottom we actually state

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,740
explicitly how we're going to iterate

00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:42,050
through this sequence whereas the top

00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:45,730
one does not have this and the baking

00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:47,900
declarative form is more amenable to a

00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:51,800
person in the future in different ways

00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:55,160
so unsure monmouth medical example here

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,980
and because there is like what they want

00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:00,680
is not to get in time we don't have time

00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:04,850
to get in details how it works but these

00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,620
two which one do you prefer more without

00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:16,520
actually knowing what it does just by

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:21,640
reading both are you okay it's full the

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,640
bottom one is formatting okay laughs

00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:29,780
more than I don't get it complete but I

00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,970
think the technology so if I didn't

00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:35,570
schedule that the game difficult there

00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:38,000
right okay so second one oh this is and

00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:39,470
Magnemite compile down to the same thing

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:53,000
we don't know anything about

00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:56,380
implementation and so any other one okay

00:30:53,000 --> 00:31:00,680
second one is more readable to someone

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:04,100
yeah I find that expression inside the

00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:07,790
energy the second expression right

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,980
around the little black okay quadri so

00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:19,640
we complexity of some expressions in the

00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:22,570
bottom is seized hi so so the top one is

00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:26,210
more functional than the bottom one and

00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:29,810
if you look at here we have similarities

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:31,910
like I and L that change the meaning so

00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:33,830
the iteration and so to actually

00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:36,290
understand what it does you need to step

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,970
through it whether it be there is an

00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,380
interesting thing here some of the

00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,030
functionality was factored out in

00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,120
advance function which can be tested

00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:46,280
separately he got a name so we we can

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,000
understand a little bit about what it

00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:52,580
does and then this statement is a meter

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,800
that does work identical to the word

00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:57,170
with it is down here and then this is

00:31:54,800 --> 00:32:00,650
just the post-processing deformity

00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:03,560
result slightly nicer so functional I

00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:05,330
think we sort of got it here in the

00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,560
bottom there were some opinions from

00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:11,240
people who didn't know anything about

00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:15,380
Mathematica syntax red bottom few more

00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:21,440
complex so and finally returned a real

00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:24,400
real life example there is the red black

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,980
trees even heard about red black trees

00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:31,070
yeah so then so go and sin data

00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:34,340
structure and a HP is it just like

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,290
redwood trees but slightly different and

00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,770
then Arnie understand is the creator of

00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:41,870
any trees in here Isis any of these red

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,300
black trees and the decay trees wait

00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:46,250
parents trees hot dense trees and key

00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,660
neighbor trees none of them has become

00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:49,670
the structure of choice anon kroger

00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,990
misis they are all converging to

00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:55,940
implement and so he writes that even the

00:32:53,990 --> 00:33:01,190
code simplicity our algorithms compare

00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:04,580
favorably and what I've been trying to

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,650
say here that the researchers and now

00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:10,160
even in computational complexity space

00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:12,470
complexity and code complexity and at

00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:14,720
the same time to arrive it the most

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,630
simple algorithms and this is this is a

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,430
great example I think so what he did he

00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,880
take its toll the functionality waiting

00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:24,710
to see basic building blocks and the

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,760
speed and scheme and these are two

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,680
operations here what I want to do I

00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,540
don't want to explain how it works I

00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,210
just want to communicate how simple is

00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,970
algorithms are and I mean split for

00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,370
instance takes a single primer and then

00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:43,580
according to some logic it I literally

00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:45,410
last rotation where's skew operation

00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:47,390
that accepts a single parameter and

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:50,330
according to some logic it does the

00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,760
right rotation so there's sort of anti

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:56,000
symmetric but not quite and if you look

00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,790
at the balance we visualized when these

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,410
operations are white they're opposites

00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:02,480
of each other but in the implementation

00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,720
land they are not quite this is why

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,990
often shows if an names that

00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:11,900
enough antonyms and then we will get

00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:13,850
rotate right implementation and a dozen

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,920
bookkeeping if you can or the parent

00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:18,890
pointers here it's just three lines in

00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:22,820
excess again single dime a dozen

00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:27,560
rewiring and so still not not very much

00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:30,920
going on and the right location is truly

00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:34,790
be honest so it's really difficult this

00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:36,650
mirror image left and right unnamed as

00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:42,290
mirror image of each other and they are

00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:45,650
infected if you just work to be they are

00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:48,170
truly symmetric so I think this

00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:49,870
beautiful and 90 writes about the

00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,610
initial iteration he says deletion and

00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:55,370
data structures in complete nightmare it

00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,160
is conversent increment even without

00:34:55,370 --> 00:35:01,730
balancing and we shall we show how to

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,620
simplify the mission and then this is

00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:07,130
the leader direction in the

00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:09,110
implementation risk up in it it does cut

00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,400
so there is some complexity there for

00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:14,990
four parameters then it is rewire and

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,060
then it does some bookkeeping again so

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:20,090
Quad City essentially was put into cut

00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:22,520
and rewire now what is cut operations

00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,720
this is a industrial strength curve so

00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,190
it is a bit optimized the initial

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,460
calibration was actually in one flight

00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,550
but then he revisited in the mission and

00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:36,200
he decide oh if we instead of doing

00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:40,340
three-way conversation if we actually

00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:43,340
and if we do this in frequent

00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:45,350
assignments over here these two are so

00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:48,770
at the expense of being deaf we didn't

00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:52,820
actually have to compare for equality

00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:56,330
here we can deal with the lesson and the

00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:59,900
wiki that is part and the equality and

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:00,650
greater than I built here so how they

00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:07,099
move

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:10,730
the metal one and well it is more a

00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:13,369
little bit dangerous yeah and it was all

00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:16,369
over one I take your point it's a

00:36:13,369 --> 00:36:19,549
question of style and so there is

00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:21,230
actually a nice comment describing all

00:36:19,549 --> 00:36:23,960
the things and then once you've read it

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:28,010
it makes sense and I think here we go

00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,549
for structure so from distance and it is

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:35,720
structured there and then so the

00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:38,119
function rewire I think this one

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,640
depended on balance Oregon stuff to cut

00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,609
in the grounds of the Kappas just a few

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,210
skills and splits and a bit allergic

00:36:43,609 --> 00:36:49,579
there so so what I want to contrast it

00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,170
with is the stl for implementation of

00:36:49,579 --> 00:36:52,190
past the red black tree and the

00:36:51,170 --> 00:37:05,720
reference is going to switch quickly

00:36:52,190 --> 00:37:10,160
here sweetie so I'm going to sob and

00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:12,440
headed Heather eventually and in Heather

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,029
it just reading books another great

00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:19,789
function from the implementation and I

00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:22,059
think it's called three balanced for

00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:22,059
raised

00:37:26,589 --> 00:37:31,509
certainly balance for raise funding

00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:34,569
creepy things while you here so that it

00:37:31,509 --> 00:37:38,440
is possible to compare Jesus there in

00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:39,940
this very site yeah probably so um i'm

00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,579
going to count the number of pages here

00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:54,910
so there's a delete operation in red

00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:58,029
black trees 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 /

00:37:54,910 --> 00:38:00,640
12 pages this is real integration and if

00:37:58,029 --> 00:38:04,599
i zoom out you'll see that reconnection

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:09,549
my structure that is just blob someone

00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:11,440
who wants to get into into this it

00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:14,589
wasn't here the slightly longer names

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,309
but it doesn't make it more tenable I

00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:20,499
think I don't think so summary what i

00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:24,999
said is original good measure of

00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:28,859
complexity well adjusting that other

00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:33,339
memory or it may be out long security

00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:36,130
which action or I don't know it yes mr.

00:38:33,339 --> 00:38:39,219
Willis code essentially copies an

00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,140
obvious TL guarantees so it provide the

00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:45,400
same strong guarantees about exception

00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:47,410
safety and there is one to one the

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,749
original code that he published does not

00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:53,109
contain any endpoint management but if

00:38:49,749 --> 00:38:55,269
you know certain implementations in stl

00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:57,579
they require 10 pointers so where did

00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:59,710
those and there so they are very

00:38:57,579 --> 00:39:02,710
comparable in this respect so the

00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:04,029
summary here no good measure values are

00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,829
completely speed flexibility and

00:39:04,029 --> 00:39:07,960
communication and consistency in

00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:10,719
symmetry really help to get into an

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,769
unknown code base and we should write

00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:16,150
our code with future readers in mind and

00:39:13,769 --> 00:39:19,119
complexity can be perceived explicit and

00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:22,749
employed and we love functional style

00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:26,160
and declarative style of programming so

00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:26,160
how much time they have

00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:31,089
right there it is there it is very

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,730
different because we have some questions

00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:36,430
from the audience already and finalists

00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:41,980
okay so I talked about knowing the enemy

00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:45,339
part and the other half of this talk or

00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:50,109
beta shorter house or we go to know

00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:53,049
yourself part so don't think write a lot

00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:55,390
about that and extrinsic and intrinsic

00:39:53,049 --> 00:40:02,970
motivators and there are two kinds of

00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:05,410
thinking some of them can be accelerated

00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:09,760
its certain motivators are present

00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:12,460
others can't and talks with required

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,510
broad focus and I use something of

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:20,410
creative nature usually required

00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:23,440
completely different motivators and you

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:26,260
found that eating carrots and sticks are

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,599
very rigid motivators photogs very

00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,400
narrow focus like mechanical tasks and

00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:32,829
luckily that people to higher mental

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,539
faculties they may actually the

00:40:32,829 --> 00:40:38,740
productivity goes down and as you

00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:40,750
increase the reward so those polski

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,220
writes about it the waters wall and he

00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:46,140
said that that people will be more

00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,140
fulfilling they will be for money and

00:40:46,289 --> 00:40:51,880
then the single out three drives and

00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,799
autonomy mastery and purpose explain

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,430
them in great detail but i'll just run

00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:59,670
here quickly so economy is that the

00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:02,920
ability to choose what to work on

00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:06,069
usually people have that a much more

00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:09,880
productive then muster is the ability

00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:11,680
while working to gain complete

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,569
understanding of something that is

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:18,400
complex and purpose the overarching

00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:20,349
theme on this of your work this should

00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,400
be focus to what he do and if you have

00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:26,200
that

00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,030
and you usually get much further and I

00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,310
would like to add that the force one to

00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,890
this tony robbins right right at an

00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:36,280
emotion is a very strong powerful

00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:38,890
driving he believes it which it can get

00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,920
right feeling we can get through

00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:44,320
anything and so am i encourage you to

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:49,360
experiment with what drives you Mostyn

00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:54,190
and get enough sleep it's like a loan

00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:57,760
shark taking at some time today in light

00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:00,310
of painting tomorrow I'm not saying it's

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,290
lethal like that if you have there are

00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:04,720
flat seven out of eight hours today of

00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:06,580
pace to King tomorrow it's not like that

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,590
we don't have to seek a bit more but

00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,170
what you really say in your painting in

00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:14,350
lack of creativity it means morale and

00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:18,280
stubbornness and other unpleasantness so

00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:21,190
get enough sleep is important and the

00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:25,620
internet view us as an industry of edict

00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:29,080
as far as caffeine is concerned and I

00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:32,980
mean under the but withdrawal reversal

00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:34,600
before with girl read or so so if there

00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,350
is an interesting paper fortune around

00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:42,000
at basically states that there is no the

00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:45,850
boost that you receive the user receives

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,270
having had some caffeine essentially on

00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:51,310
the time scale of acceleration and it's

00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:53,320
essentially reverse all the negative

00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:55,060
effects of withdrawal so easily have

00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,590
your performance right and then as you

00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:59,860
start drinking coffee get into this

00:42:56,590 --> 00:43:01,390
cycle when the peeps of performance

00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:06,120
actually touching the performance that

00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:06,120
you had before so actually

00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:12,349
I've been very heavy coffee drinker and

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,940
then I've read the article if anyone is

00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:19,520
interested in approximately there are

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:21,559
all games and coolers so lastly and it's

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,500
very important to distinguish in time

00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:27,050
and slow time and i'm going to read what

00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,809
David lady sings and on the subject

00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,910
thinking is the slow time activity it

00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:33,950
can only speed up some aspects of it we

00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,990
both site of one half of the equation of

00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,690
thinking when fast and slow time meet

00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:40,849
half time wins naturally we will always

00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:43,010
tend to do the most urgent task first in

00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:45,440
this way the slow and long term

00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,150
activities lose out in the age when the

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,369
distinction between work and leisure a

00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:51,530
bindi race and efficiency seems to be

00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:53,119
the only value in economics politics and

00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:58,190
research this is really been useful

00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:01,700
things like far farsighted work and I

00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:05,990
think John hiders summed it up really

00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:08,089
nicely with allow real-time for silent

00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:10,430
reflection turned inward and digest what

00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:14,329
happened let the census rest and grow

00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:17,210
still and so I encourage you to find

00:44:14,329 --> 00:44:19,369
some time for yourself during the day of

00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:22,280
an hour so and find what environments

00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:24,230
working as our head of the department

00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,990
used to say it's time to look back at

00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:30,710
what we've learned draw a line and

00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:34,970
reflect and final pieces of advice that

00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:39,290
I gather is this is a from NH teen

00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:42,829
article by Peter Norvig way he looks the

00:44:39,290 --> 00:44:46,790
box titled learn a in the days or learn

00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:50,210
a in the hours even raised as well and

00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:52,579
he he called single Johnson who says

00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:55,940
with excellence in any department is not

00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:59,930
to be purchased at a lesser price the

00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:02,480
prices we labor rule lifetime and his

00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:03,950
advice is that the legal practice you're

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,049
just doing it again and again but

00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:08,299
challenging yourself with a task that is

00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:10,609
just beyond the current ability sign it

00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:12,680
analyzing your performance while and

00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:16,359
after doing it and correcting any

00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,359
mistakes then repeat and repeat again

00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:28,760
so this is final flight of my talk and I

00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,430
would like to highlight that we don't

00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:34,730
have control over the time that we were

00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:38,090
given or the time we leavin and healthy

00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:40,540
diet yes only so far and we need genetic

00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:44,450
lottery well it's a lottery isn't it is

00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:46,760
realistically and interesting so as than

00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,460
the end of my wife stabbed once to meet

00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:52,190
with their desk pours water of wisdom on

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:53,930
dry and so is there is something that

00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:57,170
you really really want to do don't

00:45:53,930 --> 00:46:01,180
postpone it until tomorrow have a very

00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:11,720
good plan you keep it boldly and now

00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:24,470
thank you thank you very much any

00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:27,140
questions okay I'll be available for

00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:30,020
call it may be the best around if we

00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,470
march for IC rather all is that people

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:36,950
confuse the bell for example by choosing

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:39,500
names they said are not appropriate and

00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:41,780
publish my jello story has a fool just

00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,610
across the bar you maybe don't

00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,650
understand it buddy they must have a

00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:48,590
chicken just cross the road you know

00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:51,590
what retaining dinner and he called it

00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,960
the same day truth strange attribute

00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,120
names and then they'll make a lot of

00:46:53,960 --> 00:47:00,740
mistakes because they don't understand

00:46:56,120 --> 00:47:04,339
or intercept on mm-hmm I am very fair
