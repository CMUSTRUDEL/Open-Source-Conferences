right everybody well I'm going to

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,650
present this project that they have been

00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:20,660
developing in the last five years more

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:26,850
or less it's called sequently because

00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:30,480
it's mainly a poetic a library to access

00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:33,629
databases are well everybody of you know

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,750
probably there in Python it's pretty

00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:41,340
easy to reach to work with databases in

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:45,840
and reach a database there are many ORM

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:51,210
that allow for a good abstraction level

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,360
and so that it's even more simple what I

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:57,899
felt is that there is still lrl path

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,410
from this situation to have a highly

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:05,100
interactive way of handling data from a

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:07,979
database just look for example when I

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,689
want to browse data of an application of

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,170
a different application or just when I

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:16,140
want to write my own application both

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,890
very little ones sound very complex one

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,909
I wanted to fill this gap so what is

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,150
what are we talking about it's a both a

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,270
package called secretive to write

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:33,450
application that use databases mainly we

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,799
are presenting two mega widgets one to

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:40,890
edit data in a form or mask way and the

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,869
other as a table and their son their

00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:51,149
mixer that is editing both the form and

00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:54,450
related data sequel it is an application

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:57,689
that of course is built on secretly

00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:04,229
available in the package that allows me

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:06,899
directly to go and edit theta the

00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,660
audience let's say not just even there

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:12,550
of this package is both the end user

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,700
that may just use the application

00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:17,350
to get the data directly test to develop

00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,530
application developers that want to

00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:25,300
develop an application and impiety decay

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:27,430
or any developer that is just in the

00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,340
need of browsing data from an

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:32,950
application he is developing for example

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,150
a web application but you need to browse

00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:39,670
some data and there will be some example

00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:41,850
in it I'll focus on the characteristic

00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:46,450
of the widgets rather than their

00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:50,610
implementation the way what I'm

00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:55,150
presenting now is some that i consider

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:59,380
original ideas of the package ideas that

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:03,580
i personally never so another software

00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:06,330
and that maybe you may like or not but

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:09,550
anyhow i think their original of this

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:12,730
key point with some key points and

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:16,180
present particularly completion we'll

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:20,530
see what it is filters constraints

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:23,260
totals configurability and of course i

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,140
need to say spend some time on the basis

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:29,890
that is sequel alchemy substantially i

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:34,959
won't say almost anything about by gtk2

00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:37,120
rose and the way I the road map before

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,630
this presentation will be just a trailer

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,830
to to start with sequel Acme elements

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:47,670
good examples whose goal is to show how

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:53,110
little code is needed to get ready and

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:57,480
work my idea is that the learning curve

00:03:53,110 --> 00:04:01,360
is very very simple flight and

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,920
presentation of the widgets to the user

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,510
how the user interact through the

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,550
widgets and presentation to the

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:12,100
developers how you can customize that a

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:15,959
printing system then I developed on

00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:21,580
purpose for this and the application ok

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,790
let's start the tool is circulated it's

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:28,040
a command line tool

00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:32,880
just to have an idea and it can be

00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:35,790
invoked in these two ways that is using

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,490
as argument at the URL of a database or

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:43,160
just a nickname whose configuration is

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,160
somewhere else let's say for example I

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:55,020
use a nickname that is demo and here is

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:58,220
just a demo database that we will use

00:04:55,020 --> 00:05:02,720
that is very with no great fantasy

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:05,850
director of movies and so on okay and

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:10,710
what I can see is that for example I can

00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:12,810
open a table view on fields and you see

00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,060
that here this is blue this is blue

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,160
because this is really a foreign key to

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,710
some other tables or blue just reminds

00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:28,080
me that this is not a data in this in

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:31,530
this table and for example director and

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:36,060
I can have this thing again as a table

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:39,920
or I can have this for example as a mask

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:43,950
okay so i can browse all the data now

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:46,980
let's go back let's say what we saw that

00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:51,570
one is that from the comment line so no

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:53,790
editing no code right now the same

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,980
widgets but from Python how long it is

00:05:53,790 --> 00:06:00,570
to set up which it's like that one and

00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:03,240
this is the code you need just the

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:09,000
imports by the way there is a pretty

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:11,100
reach demo demo that a you can invoke

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,790
like this that has more or less a

00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,220
hundred different sector snippets of

00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:19,920
code and for example this one is the

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,620
base one and says exactly all the code

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:27,710
necessary to get started with these

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:33,360
regions now

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:35,550
this is the way to open the table and

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,830
this is the way to open the mask okay

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,800
just the name of the widget is different

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:44,160
all the rest is equal now let us see

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,880
here you have some way to provide your

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:58,020
of the database and the table that in

00:06:47,880 --> 00:07:06,450
this case is a stain okay for a cheese

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:08,870
are correctly rendered this way and you

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:14,820
see that the widget shows some yellow

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:17,880
field that are they needed you cannot

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,770
leave it blank okay now require the

00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,040
information to start there as we said

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:25,920
table database accession the table can

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:28,380
be passed as string but a much richer

00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:31,430
and in that case the database isn't

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,620
respected so I can get some information

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:39,020
or a class remember that we will see in

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:44,150
a way in a minute what it is database as

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:47,910
URL as per sequel alchemy simplex and

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:53,220
session that again again is a sequel

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:58,380
alchemy object we will now present very

00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,210
very simply these four elements of

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,780
psycho alchemy that are needed to

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:07,050
understand security so you know that our

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:09,510
Python uses classes attributes and

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,710
assignments so that if you have an

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:17,310
object that is a movie you can write m

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:22,530
equal movie and the title equal whatever

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:26,370
you want on the other side database use

00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:28,920
tables columns troubles and sequel to

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,099
write something so insert into movies so

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:36,900
if we want to use our more familiar

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:38,250
syntax we can rely on something that a

00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,310
layer that is called

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:44,580
or I'm or object relational mapping as

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:48,420
late each modification we do to the

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:53,700
objects into sequel in a certain moment

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:58,980
but that will occur are all the times

00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:01,440
that we modify a particular class only

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,220
for those object that belongs to

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,830
something that we call a session and the

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,440
translation occurs when session commit

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:15,930
is called ok on the opposite when we

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,110
query the database through something

00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,420
like session that query something all

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:25,350
the objects return belong to this

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:28,890
particular class so that we are sure

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,200
they will be mapped back correctly now

00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:37,470
the question is how can we create this

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:40,920
class as the model is easily made with

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,680
the declarative syntax can be made in

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,720
other different methods but now we're

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,240
not talking about sickle alchemy we are

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,380
just talking about secretly so let's

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:58,020
just focus on the easier way ok so just

00:09:52,380 --> 00:10:02,160
an example here is the director class is

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:04,530
prepared in a decorative way and we can

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:10,230
see then we have to declare the table in

00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:12,720
the database the ID then sorry the older

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:19,560
fields that these guys are ID and name

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:24,630
and possibly relations to other other

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,060
other tables in this case movies that is

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,530
the relation to moving of course movie

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:35,070
needs to have back a foreign key to hear

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:38,339
clearly this last movie attribute cannot

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,740
be devised by introspection of the

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,790
database so this is something important

00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,970
that we will get back later now the

00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:49,710
mapper each class that has been prepared

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,470
in this way

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,970
we'll have an associated mapper that

00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,630
defines the correlation between the

00:10:53,970 --> 00:11:00,840
classes attributes and tables columns in

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,720
this case ed and main or map directly to

00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:07,320
count up there are things that are not

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:09,570
mapped directly to a column functions is

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:16,410
an example and the other is relationship

00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:20,250
that we have just seen sequel keep uses

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:23,100
the mapper and not else and not anything

00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:26,520
else in the mapper to devise how each

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:30,470
field must be represented so even when

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:34,380
you pass for example it a string it goes

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:39,000
use a sequel alchemy to introspect the

00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:42,240
database get back table create on the

00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,550
fly a class that has a mapper and takes

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,480
the mapper and looks which are the

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:50,460
fields defined in the matter so that

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,830
really if you're able to create the

00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,450
mapper in any other way and if you know

00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,700
sequel alchemy you can do whatever you

00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,130
want you can provide them up or rather

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:04,950
than a class that means for example that

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:07,440
right away we can use a mapper that it

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,750
corresponds to a joint of two tables and

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,960
we can use sequel keep directly on that

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:20,880
one let's see for example here this join

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:24,060
we have created a mapper here ok and we

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,640
have reloaded it here and we see that in

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,330
fact we have some data in this table

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:35,130
that comes from the movie table someday

00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:37,290
that comes from the director one and

00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,960
they are all in the same and we can

00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:43,830
still edit one and the other so that for

00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:50,040
example i can write this and this has

00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:52,500
been saved ok and or i can for example

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,300
right this one and this has been saved

00:12:52,500 --> 00:13:02,730
ok now

00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:05,279
ah this is the view of the code that

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,649
defines the model used in the database a

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,399
little part of the model used in the

00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:13,890
database I want just to point you to

00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,860
fact that we have the director that we

00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:21,839
have almost seen before the movie but

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:23,399
clearly this it's a relation sorry how

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,829
many of you already are familiar with

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:30,839
sequel alchemy more than half okay so

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:32,760
you know what the relationship is now

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,910
you see a relational relationship

00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:39,570
because it has been changed in the 06

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,000
and now its relationship and look here

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,880
when you define the columns you can add

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,440
some info that is not treated directly

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,579
by stick well I'll give me but is used

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:55,470
by sequel kita just to change the way

00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:58,560
secret it should render that field for

00:13:55,470 --> 00:14:01,829
example I have fields that I want to be

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,160
interpreted as images for example at the

00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:10,020
cover of the filmer or the or a CD

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:12,329
rather than here is the what the image

00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,520
of the thing okay so these are

00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:17,790
additional information but in these case

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:23,540
I can also have a new like field sensor

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:25,589
i think i spent already enough time to

00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:28,680
specifically to explain what the

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,420
director relationship is that actor

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,670
movies doesn't have corresponds with any

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:36,120
column its value is a collection of

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:38,850
movie objects you can see like this for

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,459
example the equal director named equal

00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:45,839
filling the movies movies la strada

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:50,029
automate okay and clearly movie will

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:54,209
have other objects that in turn are

00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:59,220
related to for example generous actors

00:14:54,209 --> 00:15:02,910
and so on the last thing I skipped a

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:05,610
little bit is session all the objects

00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:09,519
that must be persisted into the database

00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:13,699
needs to belong to a

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:18,050
asset that is the object it's an object

00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:21,019
called session and really a commit and

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,759
query are attributes methods of the

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:29,839
session and you can provide directly the

00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:32,449
session or you can use adb proxy that is

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:39,170
just something easier to feel because

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:41,449
you must be careful to set the session

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,910
correctly depending on the database so I

00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:47,839
provide this one but you don't need to

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:50,389
do that now let us go back to examples

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:56,149
the first thing is a complete example

00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:59,029
the simplest one but with chick gtk the

00:15:56,149 --> 00:16:01,610
only GDK part here is imported ich

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:11,360
educate up mane so this is really

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:13,540
working example for this and we can run

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,540
it

00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:29,519
okay oops all right in Italian next one

00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:33,300
I will start okay and here it is and it

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,490
works like this okay up to now let us

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,970
introduce something more I want to add

00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:42,779
the layout I want to well here the

00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:47,189
layout is not really anything it's just

00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:49,170
all laid out one after the other well of

00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:51,809
course here you can see that this is a

00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:53,999
text this is a text to this is the ear

00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:56,550
and by the way it's a funny thing to

00:16:53,999 --> 00:17:01,439
write the ear because it has a dot the

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:04,350
punctuation that divides thousands and

00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,990
here is a date with a calendar and all

00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:11,579
these has just been done automatically

00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:13,500
this is the director and it's blue so

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:17,250
that it reminds me it's a foreign key i

00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:21,230
have only some possible value at all

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:25,709
right here we will see this later and

00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:28,500
fields that have an image only had the

00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:31,770
name of the image that is not a lot okay

00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,539
now we want to add the layout and we

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,789
want to change the layout in this way

00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,950
for example we only want title ear

00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:44,940
director they'd really like this one

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:49,080
okay up if somebody knows gtk it does he

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:52,649
it has something that is called Glade

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,990
and you can create the only lu1 but i

00:17:52,649 --> 00:17:57,500
don't want to go to that one I want to

00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:02,630
be much shorter than that look I just

00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:06,270
create this string that contains sorry

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:09,510
the string that contains title year date

00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:12,120
released directly the image and clearly

00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:16,350
it says that i want date release be on

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:18,899
the right side of year and image on the

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,570
right side of the rectory and i want the

00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:24,650
title you see those two slashes to be

00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:29,240
spammed one more field one more common

00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:32,180
so all i have to do after pre-painted

00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:37,460
the string is to pass the string to the

00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:44,530
way out you can think this way of

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:48,890
passing that the layout is related to

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:52,670
xml of gtk builder or dwade more or less

00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:59,810
like rest language Resta markup is

00:18:52,670 --> 00:19:03,350
related to xml next example I want to

00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:08,240
have movie I want to add something oh

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:12,590
sorry yes okay okay next example we want

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,560
to use instead of the stream movie we

00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,660
want to string add mode of that movie

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:21,080
why that we prefer to use the model

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:26,900
because we said before that the mother

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:29,360
has more information than the stream so

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,160
that we can use for example some

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,730
information about how to render the

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:38,450
image and that way we can just just

00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:41,240
simply because we modify an ever wrote

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:43,610
model that movie we can write something

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:49,490
like this one and we say I want the

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:51,310
image here I want it is rendered with an

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:55,100
image but that would be the default

00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:57,320
since we are using the model but we are

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:59,630
using these strange syntax that says get

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,450
rid of the level because you see here I

00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,190
have a level a level a level and here I

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:06,110
don't have any level I don't want the a

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:10,460
level because we will see what the

00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:12,500
allowable is for and in the model the

00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:16,640
worst the information info render equal

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:19,450
image and that's all I need okay so if i

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,450
go back here

00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:42,960
no sorry this was the second oh no okay

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:46,320
and here it is okay by the way I decided

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,059
that description that was normally

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,840
presented as a single room I wanted a

00:20:49,059 --> 00:21:02,259
text area so I just wrote this modifier

00:20:52,840 --> 00:21:04,509
TXS text so that it's easily now one one

00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:07,720
more thing again with a model I can also

00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:11,139
edit relationships so look at this this

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:14,529
is the way I can have a director with

00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:17,379
the first name last name nation and all

00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:21,759
the movies his movies all I have to do

00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:24,070
is simply to add m2m equal movies and it

00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,830
will show up all the related movies and

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:33,850
I don't have to write anything else so

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:35,590
here again you are probably this I have

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:38,080
not prepared that example that we have

00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:43,509
many more in the IRS is the demo number

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:45,429
20 okay now let us go one in the slides

00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:49,720
that would be available on my site there

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:53,980
are there is all the possible modifiers

00:21:49,720 --> 00:22:01,119
for the layout I want spend time on this

00:21:53,980 --> 00:22:04,119
now clearly you can get to each single

00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,919
widget that is created that is a gtk

00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:08,049
widget and you can modify whatever you

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:13,269
want about it with their normal gtk

00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:15,249
tools which it can also be customized so

00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:19,299
that it represents things I want in

00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:23,850
whatever way for example these is an

00:22:19,299 --> 00:22:26,289
interesting one because I an integer is

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:29,919
represented normally with an entry and

00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:33,759
with a number for example here was 2000

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,220
or something like that here these 12

00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:41,039
fields

00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:45,799
really integers when each one says which

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:49,110
are the days of the month in which bus

00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:52,049
service take place okay so i just wanted

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,780
to render each single bit as a checkbox

00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,299
i just created a we just specifically

00:22:54,780 --> 00:23:02,809
for this one and I can just represent

00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:05,659
the only now from the user point of view

00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:08,460
let's say completion is one of the

00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:11,460
things that makes it very useful a

00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,010
completionist of the way you can avoid

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:17,480
to write something when the database

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:23,309
already have that kind of information so

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:25,890
let us go back here for example this is

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:31,260
a movie and suppose you want to write

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:35,070
this one and I can come right in control

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,640
enter I can have all the director that

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:41,669
are present here with the F and is both

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,799
starting with f or like Truffaut that is

00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:47,039
not starting but the f is in the middle

00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:49,950
or i can just query with shift enter oh

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,610
that starts exactly that way or it can

00:23:49,950 --> 00:24:01,220
ask for all independently from what i

00:23:53,610 --> 00:24:04,710
have written okay this is just what now

00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:08,700
which are the key part of this one one

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:11,730
is what i want to filter on because

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:15,929
please remember director ID is clearly

00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:19,549
in an ID in our director table so in our

00:24:15,929 --> 00:24:22,289
movie table is just an ID so when i'm

00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:24,900
trying to complete i'm working in

00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:29,130
another table that is related to that

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:33,480
one and i have to choose when i write f

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:35,100
i'm not i'm not looking in this table

00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,950
i'm working in the other they will need

00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:42,630
the directory table and I should decide

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:44,990
which is the field I'm browsing ok so in

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:48,260
this case is the last name

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,559
of the director and then I can decide

00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:55,130
that I want to show something different

00:24:51,559 --> 00:25:01,160
for example in this case I use the last

00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:04,280
name as a filter but I use name and last

00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:06,800
name and first name as a way to show

00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:12,710
what should be represented and I have

00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:17,330
complete the free to choose how to

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:20,920
represent it really completion can be

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:25,970
configured so that for example you can

00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:28,340
group result sets or you can filter

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,340
because for example you can say i want i

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:34,010
want a completion only to return some

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:43,910
subset of what it could be returned for

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:49,850
example i can return I can return for

00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:55,370
example completion is here on dynamic

00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:59,030
one look at this if I go here lastly I

00:25:55,370 --> 00:26:01,850
do like this and it says Fellini do me

00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:04,880
only in this case there are many more

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:07,130
ones because in this case I decided that

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,110
completion should be filtered with only

00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,360
Italian ones and battalions has been

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:15,320
taken from here so it's that it

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:19,460
dynamically understands it then the way

00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:23,770
is written here okay we will go back to

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,770
how to programmatically change this one

00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:30,770
filters is another key point of secret

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:37,280
eat all the times you need to filter

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:42,470
data and the wave sequel kit does it is

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:46,309
pretty simple so let us go back here in

00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:48,020
the for example in this example and

00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:53,450
let's say that I want to understand

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:55,670
which are all they pay the last name

00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:58,730
whose last name

00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:01,340
has f is this is similar to what we have

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:04,070
seen before and again is fine cetera

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:08,210
fulfilling we already sorry and we also

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:13,850
want to crawl see which of these have

00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:18,530
done a film that has la in the title and

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:21,260
we see that we only have two now and of

00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:24,710
course for example in this case we have

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:28,730
the LA just in one film and not in the

00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:31,640
other but so the filters is done both on

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:35,060
the table and starting from and on

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:38,170
possibly all related fields and this is

00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:40,580
just because the filter mechanism

00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:43,430
understands that i have a related one

00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:45,770
and tries to join well and joins the two

00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:49,250
table and applies the filters on both of

00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:51,820
them but as a programmer i didn't need

00:27:49,250 --> 00:28:00,490
to write one single row this is all done

00:27:51,820 --> 00:28:00,490
under the hood by sea cookie and okay oh

00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:10,450
by the way I forget to show the way I

00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:15,170
can add a filter is just the clicking on

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:19,910
where is the where is the mask oh here

00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:24,080
well clicking on the level it pops up

00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:29,060
the filter and I can use whatever I want

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:31,100
as an operator or I can click in these

00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:39,830
cases I can click on the header of the

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:43,070
column and add the filter okay elders on

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,440
dates up a typical situation is that I

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,390
need to filter on dates in a relative

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,940
way I want to see all the invoices of

00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:53,300
last month for example i want to see all

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:57,380
the hours I work for somebody in this

00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,530
year so let us see something for example

00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,530
like this

00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:21,360
mm i go back here in a minute because it

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:28,080
shows something more than off all right

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:31,410
i should get rid of how to show that one

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,650
no because I I have different IP and my

00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:38,010
database is not listening on that I be

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:42,360
so we can we can see maybe later if

00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:44,820
you're interested how to filter on dates

00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,390
but there for example you can say simply

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:55,020
I want to see all lets us see with the

00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:57,630
films ok we have related okay you see

00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:00,840
this is state release okay and I can say

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:04,980
let me show all the film that were

00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:08,510
released in the last five years and this

00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:15,600
is just epsilon minus five that it means

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:18,830
since it's a white sari why is the year

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:21,270
so it's just the beginning of the year

00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,430
capitalized at the end of the year so

00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:26,640
with this one I can have an algebra

00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:29,550
updates related to the moment I run the

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,660
query and that's pretty useful or i can

00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:37,500
say all the all the field that were

00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:39,180
released exactly during the app is like

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,060
from the beginning to the end of that

00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:47,900
period and i don't have any film in

00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:57,890
there okay but in this I do have okay

00:30:47,900 --> 00:31:01,920
now totals is another nice feature of

00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:05,510
secretly totals allow you to show in a

00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:14,030
table which is the total now I have a

00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:14,030
very silly one here big no le one is

00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:23,470
otos because I'm adding years so this is

00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:25,690
pretty stupid but now I feel how this is

00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:29,470
just a way to show in this case i can

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:32,859
say i want to show all the sum for this

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:36,099
one i can also group by for example on

00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:38,859
the ear so this is a stupid example but

00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:44,590
the database is not working right now in

00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:46,509
a while i'll start it again and now let

00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:49,149
us see how to browse data from one

00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:52,989
situation to the other i can click on

00:31:49,149 --> 00:31:58,029
the right of the single row and pop a

00:31:52,989 --> 00:32:02,789
single mask to edit the data and oops

00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:07,779
and you see for example if i move around

00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:10,359
just changes so it's it's a way i can

00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:15,309
browse data and i can force and i say

00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:18,999
when you pop the window the mask just to

00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:25,200
edit this role please open it with a

00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:30,009
specified and registered layout from the

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:34,029
point of view of the programmer now you

00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:35,440
have constraints that you can add what

00:32:34,029 --> 00:32:37,899
is the constraint the goal of the

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,629
constraint is that are you normally

00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:44,289
don't want the user to have visibility

00:32:40,629 --> 00:32:46,330
on all fields and so you want to limit

00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:48,789
the visibility of some fields depending

00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:52,869
on whatever you think I'm records we are

00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:55,859
talking about records not columns so you

00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:58,509
can set that programmatically really

00:32:55,859 --> 00:33:01,299
what you do is that you can add

00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:04,200
conditions and or or that will be

00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:08,820
applied to any query that the user

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:12,369
issues the user can get rid of filters

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:18,309
filters we have seen before but cannot

00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:21,129
get rid of any constraints since sequel

00:33:18,309 --> 00:33:24,060
alchemy doesn't provide a very simple

00:33:21,129 --> 00:33:31,230
way to add constraint to add

00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:37,670
filters on a query i added a thin layer

00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:40,050
that wraps the query so that allows

00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:41,760
syntax like this one for example add

00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:44,520
constraints director and the squareness

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,740
carnation allah if you know django this

00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:51,060
is inspired by junk at least okay and

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,700
just to have an example you can write

00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:59,340
for example the electorate nation equal

00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:03,090
IT year less than equal 2000 or equal to

00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:07,500
and look at here that if the comparison

00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:09,900
between the syntax that is allowed by

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,470
sequel get em this is the syntax that

00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:22,230
would be allowed bicycle alchemy no

00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:28,740
sorry really okay and this is for the

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:31,590
for a joint as much even worse and you

00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:36,590
can use Django like syntax buffer

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:41,630
constraints filters completions okay I

00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:45,030
try to hurry up a little bit we have I

00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:49,310
provided a mechanism of hooks and

00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:53,190
signals so that you can configure any

00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:54,870
widget in a simple way and in many

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,080
different places like validation

00:34:54,870 --> 00:35:01,290
completion change they state change

00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:07,590
layout creation hooks are something like

00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:10,290
this a a simple object you create one

00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:12,990
method that has a specific name that is

00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:17,790
tested if it is present it would be run

00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:21,090
and for example you can say validation

00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:24,240
change falls for field these fields if

00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:26,070
there is some differences raised

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,690
validation error I don't want you to

00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:32,010
change anything and you would won't

00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:34,530
change anything there are a lot of hooks

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:37,290
here is a list now let's concentrate a

00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:40,760
little bit on a completely different

00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:44,610
I think that I added to sequel get this

00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:49,290
meant to provide a simple way to get to

00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:53,250
printing repair reprint can be a very

00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:55,470
lengthy operation so that sometimes it

00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:59,460
takes too much time in this developers

00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:03,180
time because the customer clearly wants

00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:08,040
something that has font and whatever he

00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:10,500
wants I moved up this task to the

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,380
customer because I prepared a template

00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,330
system that uses open office so you can

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:20,220
ask the use openoffice to create a

00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:22,560
template it's similar to a module that

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,680
is called a real at oriel I don't know

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,350
if anybody of you have used it that

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,310
relat Oreo uses openoffice template but

00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:35,280
in a different way because it really

00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:37,620
quick it requires the UNA mode you'll be

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,550
present so that an open office running

00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:43,200
instance must be present on the contrary

00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:45,180
is a little bit simpler the same that

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,540
because with realtor you you may need

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:58,080
some markers for some janky syntax from

00:36:51,540 --> 00:37:00,240
a template and it with the my system the

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,300
syntax is very simple we'll see it in a

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,370
while and it's a little bit less

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:09,630
powerful for example you cannot use it

00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:14,070
for images or not even for Excel format

00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:16,230
ODG how it behaves like a normal

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:20,160
template it requires a context that is

00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:24,420
some are variables that would be

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,860
rendered this is an example you have in

00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:31,560
this part on the left the usual masks

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:33,660
that we have used in these cases I want

00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:39,090
to prepare something that looks like

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:42,660
this first name the director and the

00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:45,330
nation and all the films he produced

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:50,560
okay and I prepare something that is

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:55,970
like this so are we have

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,970
here we have some dollar object nation

00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:04,850
dollar object last name dollar project

00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:08,720
first thing but here is the very thing I

00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:12,380
have blast blast dollar title dollar

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:17,900
description dollar here and now the fact

00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:24,010
that I have + + here just will go to

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:27,260
these three rows why there because a

00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:30,980
secret get have prepared a context like

00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:37,700
these movies equal and all the objects

00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:41,030
so that here what is particular is that

00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:46,250
this table in of an office has a name

00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:48,830
that is movies this oops sorry that is

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,510
movies it can also be table 1 but just

00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:54,130
because that's the default if you only

00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:58,910
have one but you may have different so

00:38:54,130 --> 00:39:02,210
it calls movies and simply the fact that

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:06,650
movies is a list with several object

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:09,680
would be enough to say look into that

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:13,100
table if you find something like + +

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,080
dollar then all the dollar of that row

00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:19,820
will be just the attributes of that

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:22,900
objects you understand so the your

00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:26,780
customer that is trying to get a nice

00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:29,750
printer only have to decide which is a

00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:36,380
font which is the dimension of their

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:38,650
columns and anything like that one this

00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,330
module is called ooo template is

00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:45,070
distributed with the sequel kid but is

00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:45,070
totally independent from any other part

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:50,920
okay let's get to the last part okay

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,180
person an answer some daughter so

00:39:54,710 --> 00:40:01,180
comprising EDG

00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:07,400
okay so unconditionally fine so sorry I

00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:11,420
now seek related I already said that

00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:13,910
sequel edit is the tool from common line

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:19,040
that allows you to get directly to the

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:21,380
database to the data what is peculiar

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,180
and what I present here about Zika lady

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:30,440
see a sequel in it has a rich

00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:33,460
customization system that allows you to

00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:38,839
start with something that is just the

00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:42,740
URL of a database but then you can go on

00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:46,849
and add something more so that it just

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:50,030
behaves correctly and for example you

00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:53,300
add simply the model or you add simply

00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:57,920
the layout of some tables or and so on

00:40:53,300 --> 00:41:00,700
you can add hook set and so on now I

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,579
really need to start the database now

00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:07,540
because and to do that wait a minute if

00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:07,540
down

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,690
alright

00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:50,609
ok

00:41:55,430 --> 00:42:02,300
okay just to show you what I didn't show

00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:07,220
you before let's see for example these

00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:09,920
are everyday a while work a right on

00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:13,099
which project I worked so these are

00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:18,680
projects I work for and for example I

00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:21,829
want to see how many time I spent in the

00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:27,740
last year of this project that and I say

00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:31,250
okay here and I get exactly Olli all the

00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:34,809
hours I spent I can say okay let me sub

00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:41,540
total by month or let me sub total by

00:42:34,809 --> 00:42:51,380
quarter and what this is pretty easy but

00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:53,480
let's get back to this situation first

00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:57,980
of all the very simple configuration for

00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:02,000
next is just an any file any file and

00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:04,730
where you write for example demo URL

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:10,880
sequel aight blah blah blah da de da de

00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:12,920
sica light or a bank URL that's my table

00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,790
you can say which is the table which is

00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:22,069
the field list order by and so on but

00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:24,109
sequel keep mix does not seek you late

00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:26,390
it Nick said that configuration file

00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:29,359
does not allow you to say which is the

00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:32,180
layout you want does that allow you to

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:37,880
be safe which is the model or which are

00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:41,589
the hooks so you can add them in a

00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:46,180
directory under Nazi collated director

00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:49,880
and let us see let's suppose the

00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:53,319
situation in which I have a web site of

00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:57,109
a friend of mine it is a violent place

00:43:53,319 --> 00:44:00,170
violin ok and I need to have a look at

00:43:57,109 --> 00:44:02,210
some images because they just for some

00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:02,740
way in the website they are scramble

00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:05,290
they

00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:09,520
there are not correct i want to have a

00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:13,740
look at the data directly so let's start

00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,740
with this one and i am

00:44:34,779 --> 00:44:46,779
oh ok so I open up a site with sequin

00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:48,669
lady and I see something that probably

00:44:46,779 --> 00:44:51,759
if you know giant girl you recognize

00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:55,749
something similar ok and in particular I

00:44:51,759 --> 00:45:02,709
want to open this table this table is

00:44:55,749 --> 00:45:05,529
open in a very this is not the artist

00:45:02,709 --> 00:45:09,659
sorry this is what they want to show ok

00:45:05,529 --> 00:45:15,719
and this is not really nice way of

00:45:09,659 --> 00:45:15,719
presenting data so what I do is I add I

00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:33,569
add something here and all I'm adding

00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:39,969
now is just the layout that is this one

00:45:33,569 --> 00:45:44,439
sy a layout like this in this case much

00:45:39,969 --> 00:45:48,119
simpler and a model it's where you can

00:45:44,439 --> 00:45:48,119
just open up this same

00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:07,170
it's just the same just the same mosque

00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:10,140
all I had to add is really a little

00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:12,570
description of the modal and this layout

00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:14,130
that's all and I registered the layout

00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,490
and they said all the time you open up

00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:27,380
that table the open it like this but

00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:27,380
let's go a little bit further and for

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:45,280
and you see here i added something more

00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:49,089
i added for example the discography and

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:51,130
all I had to do to add discography is

00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:54,309
that I added something like this and for

00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,589
example I added this funny thing major

00:46:54,309 --> 00:46:58,869
major that is an expander and expand

00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:02,799
their like this one okay an open this

00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:08,950
expander and I can look at this and just

00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:13,359
to finish i show you how i could oh and

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:15,369
I also wanted to add this fact that that

00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:18,369
I had the images also in the filter

00:47:15,369 --> 00:47:21,250
panel because if I want to filter or I

00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:22,960
want to see something I have the filter

00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:26,440
panel and I wanted to add this one and

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:30,190
this has been added just adding hooks

00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:33,549
and I just said who's only neat when

00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:36,760
when you initialize it add will widget

00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:39,430
filter at panel add column photo in the

00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:44,140
filter panel and just this one single

00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:47,680
row was enough to have the him to have

00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:54,270
in the filter panel the image okay last

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:57,400
thing just to show a different up a

00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:59,849
different way of representing the same

00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,849
layer

00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:16,069
look here i have discography and reviews

00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:21,710
in a tab note that but how could i do

00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:24,920
that well i just less layout i just did

00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:29,480
this all this code was necessary to have

00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:32,390
it and i say i'm setting up a layout but

00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:36,619
since the mapper already knows that this

00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:39,740
one reviews is a related attribute

00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:42,859
already knows that it will render it as

00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:45,650
a sequel table and here it is this is

00:48:42,859 --> 00:48:48,020
this is a sequel table and this is

00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:53,210
another sequel table that represents

00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:57,050
something else okay i think it's almost

00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:59,720
over well localization it's localized

00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:05,900
now in Italian as you can guess Spanish

00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:08,359
polish German and of course would be a

00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,930
nice contribution to anybody that likes

00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:15,500
it there to add some other languages

00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:18,319
there is a Debian package from pboro but

00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:22,819
system that is also the author of the

00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:31,069
logo okay now if you have any question

00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:38,710
I'm pleased to answer an English version

00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:42,260
as well the English person yeah yes

00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:51,319
sorry right well at least is my English

00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:58,069
for sure so in fact I didn't present

00:49:51,319 --> 00:50:04,369
that was in English origin oh no other

00:49:58,069 --> 00:50:06,680
questions um two questions like one

00:50:04,369 --> 00:50:09,400
what's the big advantage easy over using

00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:12,829
sequel quit on a desktop application

00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,510
worsens like Django admin on the web no

00:50:12,829 --> 00:50:17,660
no this is just for a desktop

00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:19,970
application no but like why why why do

00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:24,940
we see cool kid on a desktop and

00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:28,490
not Jenga on a web why I prefer a

00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:32,660
desktop application yes because well I

00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:37,240
really believe that even if it's very

00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:40,640
nice to have a Django I like the Django

00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:43,250
framework but it's not that easy as this

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,060
one to set up and to configure and there

00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:49,099
are things that are not done so well and

00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:51,440
I can show some application that is

00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:56,380
really customized highly customized and

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:59,180
to do that to the same degree of the

00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:02,150
Internet's say into the operability

00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:06,170
would be much more difficult using

00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:10,849
javascript on top of django than using

00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:13,730
this one what I I hope you understood is

00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:16,550
that using this one you really write

00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,770
very little code and you get something

00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:22,010
amazing in the functionality that has

00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:25,010
been added and even the jungle mean is

00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:28,960
not that powerful and many many things

00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:32,720
so that's why I preferred it if I answer

00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:35,960
ok yep one more question is have you

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,180
tried to run high GDK applications

00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,270
especially with sickle quit on Windows

00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:44,869
or Mac OS yes because they work on the

00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:47,780
whole old platform my customer uses half

00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:49,940
and half but he person but well I mean

00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:52,520
that the customer for which I developed

00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:59,180
the main application that is pretty

00:51:52,520 --> 00:52:01,910
heavy one he's a fond of Apple so an

00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,770
Apple user and uses and their Apple the

00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:07,430
only thing I couldn't get right under

00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:10,670
apple is using the Python uno module for

00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:13,460
the printing because I couldn't find the

00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:15,859
python module inside the apple I'm not

00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:18,349
an expert so if you if you can find it

00:52:15,859 --> 00:52:20,540
and let me know how to get there you

00:52:18,349 --> 00:52:23,540
know module because I couldn't do input

00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:26,390
Allah from the Python interpreter of

00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:30,740
message but that was really just a later

00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:33,170
edition so in any high-end Windows is

00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:35,510
using it directly and on the side there

00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:46,910
are information on how to use each of

00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:48,980
the different in operating system no

00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,970
other questions so let's stand

00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,970
