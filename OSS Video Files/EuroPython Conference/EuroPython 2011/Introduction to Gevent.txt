so it's all right tractor microphone

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,859
Sochi but it's a networking like

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,570
courting basically it gives the right

00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:25,269
natural demons

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,210
Network clients web applications it has

00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:30,189
an S key server so it works well with

00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:33,580
most of the Python web frameworks

00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:35,320
however it's a small equity it doesn't

00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,170
think include all possible for the

00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,770
convention simply except for the most

00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,719
basic ones like create DNS and HTTP but

00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,610
it can be as useful as logic promotes

00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,860
lots of features because professor

00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,710
mobility around networking code that is

00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:53,020
already there by the stomach library for

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,359
any vital package that is everything for

00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:57,359
vital back absorbent

00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:17,370
yeah I sell to the young project started

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,690
two years ago as a rewrite of cutlet

00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:24,190
both event life and g1 provide life with

00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,500
cooperative rescheduled so-called clean

00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:30,670
tracks that feel like they open to the

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,200
runtime of being a library teacher the

00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,080
magic that makes it possible is

00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,840
available in Grinnell extension this is

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,440
a cpython extension will make use of

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,120
some of the specs region code from

00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,260
speckle spider which is a separate

00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:50,230
distribution of - oh it supports of

00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:53,590
Fortune's juventus agreement but it can

00:01:50,230 --> 00:02:00,250
also she might work on stuck with their

00:01:53,590 --> 00:02:03,930
phone for day there's also the next

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:08,320
major question is going to be 1.0 I

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,200
replaced that ever poop with other place

00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:13,080
there's over the lumpiness QT is the end

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,520
result is that it works much better now

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,520
the changes are most internal so

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,800
from achieving zero to Jarek 2.1 and the

00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,540
Alliance is affecting g10 like Michael

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:38,410
signal not looking to work now

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:41,530
it'll work nor the internals and I'm

00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:43,180
going to describe what the describe how

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,300
the internal spoken at one point zero

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:50,380
because that reveals our cleanup easier

00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,570
and nicer to explain so the platform is

00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:55,150
to introduce orchids and a use case for

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:58,180
them in the context of the network

00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,010
then once we prep once we've got pork in

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,880
satisfying our genuine works called

00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,550
piece of them

00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,950
I will go briefly through Chile big guy

00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:11,170
and then we've got some some of the

00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,970
community divisions so if you all want

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,630
to make an identification you have two

00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,240
choices

00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,980
and whatever it shows affects the design

00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,050
of the application from bottom to top

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:22,150
because unfortunately it's not the low

00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,550
level details that you can just hide

00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,440
behind a nice abstraction our first

00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,180
choice is simpler local slope which

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,520
means if we call connect it actually

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:34,390
connects and then I don't stay off to

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,250
the core it means that that's some pyro

00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,030
people talking and that might take some

00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,630
time

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,480
most of the standard library even spoken

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,670
so most of the web frameworks depend

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,550
require nozzle sockets there are a lot

00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:53,320
of packages if you want multiple

00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:55,510
connections with local opportunities

00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,340
multiple racks and it might be a good

00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:59,590
option for up especially the number of

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:04,870
Frances small custom advantage being

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:07,180
portable just like Jima the oysters are

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,010
pre-emptive so you need logs to protect

00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,900
the share tape and we need the libraries

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,650
to do the same

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,930
anytime the picture it's a recipe memory

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:20,019
card with the step is allocated up from

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:22,840
about zero gigabyte and that puts the

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,729
women how much less you can create on

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:27,520
City to be emotionally go around office

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:31,750
space in the ballpark of wanna resolve I

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,550
also do and that has confirmed

00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,010
interesting effects of multiple because

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:39,060
in contention the problems can become

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:39,060
more somatic or

00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,229
most high-performance stuff in by the

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,559
world and outside by the room uses

00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:51,389
waters of the swamp ultimate guide you

00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:54,539
pull a request to make a request for

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,289
some sake the guy and it only succeeds

00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:58,199
if it's a wedding

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:01,619
if the dancers available immediately are

00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:03,389
you expected to attract a call when it

00:05:01,619 --> 00:05:05,550
is picked already there are a number of

00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:09,770
systems available to check police

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,419
preparedness select for people thank you

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,999
people on paper especially interesting

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,909
for networking apps in general and for

00:05:14,999 --> 00:05:20,159
web applications because they scale well

00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,979
with the number of cocoa connection

00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:25,889
other ethnic complexity is proportional

00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,360
to the number of active descriptors not

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:31,769
the number of both of these treatments

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,830
like is the case with sled before so the

00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:37,469
application becomes my secret council

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:39,089
chat is now owned by the event book

00:05:37,469 --> 00:05:42,779
which continuously both with these

00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:44,399
papers and music open the occupation is

00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:49,740
actually a set of callbacks that

00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:59,159
subscribe to events such as only later

00:05:49,740 --> 00:06:00,899
when this happens it said in this copper

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,939
he must be really good

00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:05,519
otherwise who broke the contract called

00:06:02,939 --> 00:06:08,399
Avenue so you cannot use all the nice

00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,949
work and stuff like available hostility

00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:13,559
and they cannot use most of the veteran

00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:21,059
works this is the reason why I say is

00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:25,169
the contaminated game we stay on so what

00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:29,509
Jeevan offers you is a sort of mix of

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:31,559
death of the two approaches which

00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:35,039
benefits of the cockroaches their

00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:39,139
printers a scalable a small box but they

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,849
switch them text only on at i/o ports

00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,050
this is a cooperative does that means

00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,160
that

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,380
wonder what it loves most of the time

00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,360
you don't have few problems and you can

00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:55,420
even use it as a drop-in replacement for

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:59,860
your motivated application and that's

00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:01,690
what the court is for dr. particle if

00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,540
you look at Wikipedia and definition is

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,730
with the subroutines that can be it was

00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,420
Tennessee but the definition is kind of

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:14,080
broad even when fighting words are true

00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,150
Verity from the limitations party for

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,610
example multi-shot parties is the kind

00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,530
of questions that you can boss and

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:24,250
resume but then frees you from the same

00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:27,370
quality if any one people the court in

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:30,580
them on 24 question energy in there are

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,610
over several motions that was by the

00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,330
principles kind of always symmetric

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,350
orchid

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:41,500
I think I'm that yield to the firm

00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:42,940
always seem control goes apart by can

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:47,320
generators the example of selective

00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:49,180
colleges as symmetric origins we will

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,430
specify which quarantine you want to

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,290
switch to the rule that for example is a

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:56,020
a symmetrical thing I always say I want

00:07:53,290 --> 00:08:01,330
to switch this is pretty much this

00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:03,610
difference actually not naturally

00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,610
equivalent to power if you have one even

00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,919
build a nozzle the most important

00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,540
property and that works makes people

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:15,940
wonderful is when they work in

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,440
substantial respectful parties I'm going

00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,200
to be able to save the whole stack well

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,690
not thankful gorgeous like generators

00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,120
can only save a single frame that means

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:28,020
you have to know in advance whether they

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,610
seem to call is a generator function and

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,070
you're going to be healed at all levels

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,310
you cannot try it

00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:39,729
you can infuse standard a lot of

00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:44,320
emergency penalties that basically only

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:46,960
got synchronous execution but a number

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:54,070
of our trades shared with small talking

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:55,600
about a gremlin is stackable so you can

00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,100
pull up function and that internal

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,550
function that's switching and then

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,760
because that is safe this is a much more

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,790
abstraction we use them in Aegina

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,510
so what happens when you switch for

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:13,090
vanilla residuals that it is vital to it

00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,040
in fancy Franklin when we just trade

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,230
agreement not much happens just for

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,510
cheap potential asset but then of course

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,460
switch to green it remembers its

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:26,250
position the current position on a

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,250
speckle and the marks it has exported

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:47,230
then when you switch back this spec

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,770
segment that is devoted to the light

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:54,640
this Villa is safe from the heat and

00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:57,700
then stack pointer is set back to the

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,600
original well you best be conservation

00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,570
to this

00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,490
so now we have 41 which is electic and

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,680
on the heap and interrupts that which is

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,430
an exact same state as it was because we

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,500
should remember so this part will

00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,450
continue execution of course that can

00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:23,320
now grow its own frames and that also

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:26,200
means a minute module all right this is

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,560
quite fast on this laptop I can create

00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:31,839
switch switch out 60,000 words per

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:36,790
second of course this a jeweled realness

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:39,700
and the bigger your stack the more but

00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:42,029
still sweet children usually a small

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,029
part

00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:47,320
unlike chess which is why Allah created

00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,460
object in the stack up front

00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:54,430
it uses a more efficiently allocate the

00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,410
size necessary this text mission is done

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,800
with some assembler code this assembler

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:04,810
code is written for platform saw the

00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:06,610
portability is somewhat limited yeah if

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,200
you use Finland and you want to make

00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:10,560
rossbach or not we should check on all

00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,560
the platforms

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,959
there is not a problem that there's a

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,500
structure cap called by texted and has a

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,880
certain if you realize certain exception

00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:28,399
handler then is sufficient in has

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,709
agreement that New Zealand will see it's

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,430
actually different people but lack of

00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:36,649
enjoyment in a successful that we could

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:40,610
walk around on stage under store of the

00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:42,829
perks of information report as the

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,660
portability concern can be addressed

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:46,880
somewhat with spot that there's big

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:52,190
knives is a POSIX API can uses an

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:54,350
occlusive evolution swap context doesn't

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:56,240
do this next lesson when it's later also

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,990
require okay and remember to step up

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,589
from suppressed memory requirements

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,510
comparable which does but still it's

00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,440
either well that might be possible for

00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:09,200
you I don't

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:12,680
applications it also happens to be a

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,250
slower because that was his call or

00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,649
switch there is a very small subset

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,190
ability commodity stocks context mostly

00:12:18,649 --> 00:12:25,060
for bankers when much and marketing not

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,060
funny but this

00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:40,490
it's now the Catholic abstraction okay

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:42,410
and we can use it to achieve so the core

00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:49,340
achievement is also as never think like

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:52,310
any other brand oh we use a loop written

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:56,600
in C code liebe it's actually a new and

00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:58,310
1.0 before that thing is given and that

00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:02,920
is it doesn't it's not aware of

00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,920
filaments it's called back stuff like

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:09,650
the lid lock provides the result kind of

00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:14,000
watchers levels of identification

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:15,230
signals biomass notifications and then

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,700
you can start the moisture pass a

00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:19,700
function and it will :

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:25,400
when it's functional whether the events

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:28,280
happen that this watcher watches the

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,520
mind a difference with this API from the

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,980
last version that functional support

00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:38,290
possible stock and then that means that

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:42,620
we can clear it and spoke that's Mike's

00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:46,690
remove sleep Council if counting cycles

00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,690
for jail so this equation has advantage

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:56,930
so with this non-working frame of state

00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:59,720
control here on track which reality can

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,640
take control back what you do is you run

00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,610
their little in a special dedicated

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:07,220
period it's called hop it's very

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,830
pleasant by the initial dreamer learning

00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:13,000
for stews achievement lead right traits

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,000
how initializes

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,970
trap is a green light so equal solution

00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:25,260
the interest America the carpets is wait

00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:29,070
when physical is a method that we

00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,680
possible watching and then both switches

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,900
out the cargo net nineteen that for sure

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,900
has for example if you want to implement

00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,960
compareto see you just posted an honest

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:45,750
watch initializes a number of seconds

00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:49,140
alway gives you corporate diseases sleep

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:50,940
for this robot seconds the way to the

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:53,450
limitation was also very simple just

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:56,510
switch to Manila but before you do that

00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:58,620
establish a callback to switch back

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:02,100
actual implementation is a little bit

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:05,970
more complex but much but what it does

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,830
is it checks that we she's edgy series

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,510
of switch to be scheduled and not some

00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:13,230
other switch from some other news

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:15,590
because it's not turning strictly

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:18,480
necessarily we just achievement it but

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:20,610
it's better because the problems that

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,620
you get if you switch one in some way

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:29,310
are young you don't come out right Jason

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:35,880
it's unelected and overly Ellen has puts

00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:38,760
kind of problems to this straight so you

00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,890
have to cooperate to sleep now we can

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:42,000
incorporate if something what's the

00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,530
price of something is a kind of

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,230
something that looks like open circuit

00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,820
this all that coolness matter what we

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,000
might have but actually wraps a long

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,190
walk in town this week so when you color

00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,670
seafoam and walking paths script it can

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,440
well with dragon you know

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,240
he would walk that's no problem we'll

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,260
just call well functions

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,040
I don't watch and we also Sarah 20 mr.

00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:12,090
president

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:14,430
dragon this presentation is so in that

00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:16,920
manner will prevent that all of this of

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:21,840
the cordial not only a third object boss

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:23,700
of but also DNS functions will you CRS

00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,160
for that so learning from one continuous

00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:31,140
function from German so it actually does

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,120
acceptance in success and bucks

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,050
there is no formats there is often

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:41,700
sexually this looks like a little form

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:43,350
their quarterly also is a set of G and

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,880
they're also even a select function

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:50,220
which is useful tests this is a complete

00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:52,680
example first little monkey fashion

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,530
monkey question is your place there's a

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,680
little bit with this corporator so then

00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,610
you can use the libraries that used for

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,840
example you are ugly

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:10,230
yeah you just found an additional

00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:12,380
during life looks very much like like to

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,380
you

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,049
so if all monkey bites all it does say

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,990
replaces so quick as a cell sleep select

00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:25,140
all the things that it knows about it

00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:29,940
also replaces trillion functions to make

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:32,220
them real at base so you can become a

00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,500
multi trillion application the romantic

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:40,740
watch monkey fights all is enough to

00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:43,950
make a great base before sometimes avoid

00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:45,750
but there really no reason to want to

00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,720
chemical consulted in your treatment

00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:50,279
program which was even if you think you

00:17:48,720 --> 00:18:01,830
don't need the subjects of matters Mike

00:17:50,279 --> 00:18:03,960
does so you've seen the email spunk and

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,299
function is it just a shortcut for

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,580
creating internet and startin this

00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:11,039
criminal offense capital G is a subclass

00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:13,770
of that low-level there was also a

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,830
switch one control method but you know I

00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:19,140
use power signature event application it

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,309
also has some methods to expect from a

00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:25,110
shadow like went for at the complete or

00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:28,590
rising exception and then wait for due

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:30,570
time a mostly big grin g-men is what

00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,020
that is that's Samson and that requires

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,429
were to complete majority that is a an

00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,190
exception

00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:41,099
if you want to limit the atomic weights

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:44,309
you can in most cases just part-time on

00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:47,999
permit that's not enough you can use

00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:50,309
them on plus to implement your own demos

00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:52,830
in the first example if this overall

00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,690
piece of code doesn't finish in five

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,450
seconds that amount exception is raised

00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:59,519
in a second example with the poles and

00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:04,109
second argument not only the amount

00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:11,190
exception is rice inside the woods walk

00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:12,899
but it's 70% so it seems like of course

00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:16,129
they mount the regular exceptions that

00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:19,469
can be called by except on plus

00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:22,499
something new and too much fun except in

00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:25,379
spectacle doesn't it also kind of

00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:28,799
interrupts the cones at this CPC that

00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:37,279
doesn't mean to the cupcake but you can

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:40,799
use the pool plus is for management

00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:44,549
university also has found that the

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:47,309
manifold boots boundary becomes part of

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:50,339
the school who can have a length of

00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:53,999
harmony University campus for this case

00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:57,539
ten thousand and one reaches 10,000

00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:59,470
active connections it starts active

00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:02,320
elements which are

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,390
actually it's found just folks until

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,450
there is a great story

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:18,130
the it yeah the spawn of who is inspired

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:20,470
by multiple there are this is a actually

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,530
not a good way to Obama the cell work as

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,890
number of course a just even use this is

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:31,179
Jim seven what Plus which will spawn for

00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:32,799
some kind of connection it's very easy

00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:34,900
to create your own servers you can they

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:39,220
will use it it's boots just found bus at

00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:42,760
the pool argument is that can rock your

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:45,460
connection in SSL he passed irrelevant

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,280
documents there are a number of classes

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,950
to do a stimulus and synchronous

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:53,200
communication between gremlins almost

00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:56,490
all of them press complete guy inspired

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,350
from the Python standard library you

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:02,200
didn't you know event you know you

00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:04,330
priority future enabled queue there even

00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:07,240
works although in most cases to Dominic

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:10,539
locks sometimes you for example if you

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,929
cover of the implementation and you want

00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:18,460
sent method you might want to represent

00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:20,620
method so that there are there are

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,740
several producers and they compete with

00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:24,940
each other it doesn't make sense for

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,280
amendments for the course but web

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,280
sockets a message page that makes sense

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:39,930
welcome whiskey sour

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:41,610
in the zero version bukoza one is the

00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:44,340
first place in the pool and seven

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:46,830
another scroll back under that as

00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,030
malicious one of the featured admission

00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:54,510
from the mystical arts so in the 1.0

00:21:51,030 --> 00:22:00,420
version we kind of walk the spot server

00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:02,880
because Ron is given so much this is

00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,950
something that needs to be done now this

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,850
is just an in process server and if you

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:11,010
want to deploy

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:13,500
there is a report server code do you

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,530
just say this is my application I want

00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:21,200
to use achievement whiskey I mean number

00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:26,370
of processes and runs the application

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:28,710
multi-process remarkable as I said you

00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:35,550
can use all the commercials and

00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:40,410
implemented in Python is ready by most

00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:44,390
of the database times in C so you cannot

00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:49,350
use - totp but the rightful drivers

00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:52,510
written specifically for treatment by

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:57,590
company it obvious and

00:22:52,510 --> 00:23:01,730
psycho PG do is a wrapper for C

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:03,650
libraries of books with Postgres in

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:05,539
extra Merrick support approaches for the

00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:09,890
passage that can call you oppa

00:23:05,539 --> 00:23:16,880
that looks descriptors are again it just

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:20,299
requires more functional and there are a

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,520
lot more interesting certified

00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,350
contributions there is WebSocket

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:29,179
protocol implementation so if I open

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:31,970
kind of different transports I see

00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:34,460
people all destined things promises to

00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,690
be proxy decision big Roxas various

00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:42,950
integration is zero message queue and

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:44,480
people stop at zero message Peter put

00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:48,799
some thoughts on distributed net

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:52,280
people's once plus the first time

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:56,179
expired plus Q and our more projects

00:23:52,280 --> 00:24:00,200
will get competitive but is certain

00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:03,350
human if you follow this URL there's

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:07,340
some more or less Provost of the

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,929
projects one thing this is one of the

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:13,400
users of the early user software

00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:14,620
achievement and there is an information

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,919
from the owner about

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:19,809
so they used to use twisting in a single

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,340
process but when their number of

00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:25,090
connections reached 5,000 the

00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:27,370
performance become slow so here on TV

00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:31,029
one that was able to scale the single

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:35,529
processor to you about something now

00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:38,110
because multiple servers almost the idol

00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:42,399
and they is to measure the videomicro

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:45,009
connection so the black 41.0 is been

00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:47,499
fried as positive a server with an

00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:51,999
emission also the communication is like

00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:53,350
a few more features that would be lesson

00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:58,240
would be nice to craft but they don't

00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:02,019
necessarily proclivities so to summarize

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,389
katisa easy to use easy to in stress

00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:07,480
could be as efficient as any other

00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:09,249
mobile solution as any other important

00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:12,399
framework fox squirrel of fabrication

00:25:09,249 --> 00:25:14,039
aspire ball even tries to beat the

00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:16,570
standard way the programmer place

00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:22,179
stoppin by constant uses all the

00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:27,179
standard api and works with some people

00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:30,600
much of a shock absorber of thank you

00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:30,600
any questions

00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:41,230
there's a lot of time for questions

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:47,799
anyway is a question

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:56,509
hello

00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:59,059
I'd be interested if the application

00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:01,460
which I want to realize for Zealand has

00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:05,169
to be let's say because it doesn't seem

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:11,529
to me like it has to but are there any

00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:11,529
limits like if if I have yeah

00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:20,360
in most cases you don't need to you need

00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:22,759
to begin the same this is the much more

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,860
relaxed requirements and stress because

00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:30,129
you're in a sauna switch to their

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:30,129
support works in all the kids operation

00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:41,929
so most of the time is about to answer

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:42,769
maybe sometimes another point is that

00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:46,419
authority

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:46,419
thread safe and s already relaxed it

00:26:46,899 --> 00:26:51,710
never has a problem incrementing in

00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,379
easier but it's supposed to raise

00:26:51,710 --> 00:27:01,000
conditions and social concurrency

00:26:54,379 --> 00:27:01,000
problems any other question

00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:09,070
and I was wondering if you used to

00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:14,590
database writers worthless aware Pandora

00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:21,370
was such a glow that's cool

00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:23,650
I hope they're in the early days they

00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:28,720
use MySQL connector there's my skill it

00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:31,860
was because Domino I see some people

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,860
record certificate

00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:43,200
there were some mutations in the zoo

00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:49,440
different with implementation on the

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:54,450
every dysfunction and the clue if they

00:27:49,440 --> 00:28:00,030
disappeared in the 1.0 dodging and and

00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:03,600
why they have seen their it exhibit oh I

00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:05,400
don't want them to disappear but the

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,110
question is supposed to continue you

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:26,880
slip advantage in to be summary which

00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:30,030
will switch so on why woods when she's

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,900
g-men to her that would why would why

00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:48,840
would you choose G event over event but

00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:51,110
yes there are most prisons that's

00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,110
treason

00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:55,450
well one of the reasons that was mighty

00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,929
right

00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:01,659
is that common one I won't look I see

00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:04,269
well city but with my parents and with

00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:06,970
all kinds of different elements actually

00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:09,369
I was working on violent up for comment

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,070
level and I couldn't make all of the

00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:15,249
cops work together it's just too much

00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:17,950
talk go make sure they're all the same

00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:20,799
only for details or just throw

00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:33,690
everything else we wrote some other

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:33,690
stuff just say just any other question

00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,389
covering certainly minion questions

00:29:44,239 --> 00:29:52,109
which minimum version of Python does it

00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:55,439
require if you have to the quite people

00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:58,379
define actually for g10 haven't

00:29:55,439 --> 00:30:00,089
supported to look before but I am Not

00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:03,289
sure I participate in the lesser stories

00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,289
but for the fire suit

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:17,100
how easy our heart isn't or integrated

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:19,260
cheering I dedicate a little you mean

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,150
completely you should be careful and

00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:26,310
don't you say yes

00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:29,010
well what's the zero version let's

00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:33,750
completes impossible with this new

00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:36,150
version you can provide your house is

00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,330
because Enterprise is very inspired by

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,330
the

00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:59,880
is there some new frameworks that are

00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:04,529
based on German

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:09,659
I mean HTTP web performer or adaptation

00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:12,679
or existing of existing ones but from

00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,679
ops like jungle

00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:20,309
well I'm not your tango NBS I promise

00:31:18,029 --> 00:31:25,110
maybe it was some work but there are

00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:28,260
some some work going on with I mean

00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:33,090
because G element is is very low level

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:38,850
and is there some web frameworks that

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:47,190
tries to leverage achievement to provide

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:49,769
something more easy to do to use what

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:52,200
frameworks can adjust used remembers our

00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:54,029
placement to try that they don't I don't

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,610
know if anyone else that uses team

00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:57,710
Antigua but it seems like two different

00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:00,539
clothes

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,789
Jimin just gives you good inference and

00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:05,539
sockets and web frameworks just use what

00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,539
I was of the speaker

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:17,430
Pegeen means to say that it's finite

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:19,800
transparently use gmn yes it's so if you

00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:23,570
have a synchronous triangle so your

00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,570
database and stuff it's okay

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,210
any other questions

00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:45,570
what about the possible side by

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:48,509
implication as far as I know bye-bye

00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,840
because the separate branch of sports

00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:56,850
that was support approaching so I simply

00:32:51,840 --> 00:33:02,519
said was the most the hardest part is

00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:05,450
gorillas found that we version of pi PI

00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:05,450
that supports that was

00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:29,820
anymore possible okay next the next talk

00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,320
is that

00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,320
