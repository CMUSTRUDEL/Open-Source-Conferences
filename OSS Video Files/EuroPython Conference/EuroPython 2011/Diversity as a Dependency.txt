so give it up for

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:19,690
first off I want to say thank you to the

00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,970
organizers of Python italia for hosting

00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:31,890
euro python and providing a such

00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:35,290
wonderful food best conference food ever

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:38,380
okay my name is Anna Martelli

00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:43,150
Ravenscroft I'm married to Alex Martelli

00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:47,020
the Martelli bot and i'm a member of the

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:52,540
psf i was the first female member of the

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:55,590
psf and I am co-editor with Alex of the

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:59,280
second edition of the Python cookbook I

00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,600
had well ok I was the first individual

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,770
female you were there as with it with a

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,340
company to my understanding that was

00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,969
what I was told at the time I have a

00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:15,179
bachelors I have a bachelor's from

00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:17,710
Stanford and cognitive neuroscience and

00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:21,460
I'm lucky enough to be able to apply

00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,979
Python and open source at a startup in

00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,030
Silicon Valley for learning and

00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:36,100
cognition research so that's me and yes

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:38,020
i'm a bit more diverse than most ok how

00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:43,979
many people here have had diversity

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:47,229
training at work at ok or wherever

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:51,880
hardly anybody wow you guys never work

00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:54,159
at big corporations huh yeah well he

00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:58,329
need the US almost everyone has because

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,280
they get really obnoxious about it so

00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:05,319
what do you think of when you hear the

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,689
word diversity anyone that that's a

00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:09,310
question you have to answer we're not

00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,759
going forward til someone answers

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:11,759
something

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:32,209
okay well that was an answer wonderful

00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:37,420
okay moving on so the usual way that

00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:41,810
diversity training is presented is with

00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:45,440
moral justification legal justification

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:49,459
political and social justification you

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,980
should do diversity because you want to

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,560
be a good person right and you should do

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,739
diversity in order to be a good person

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,359
you should do it for legal reasons that

00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:04,310
you know no one wants to get sued for

00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:08,269
harassment or for you no discrimination

00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:10,940
things like that and you want to promote

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:14,500
equality and inclusiveness these are

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:17,239
great reasons for doing diversity

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:23,000
unfortunately all too often the rhetoric

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:25,760
of diversity comes down to guilt which

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,329
is known as the great motivator there

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,959
was a study I read where guilt is a

00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:36,859
social emotion and it's a self

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:41,209
punishment system to stop antisocial

00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:44,620
behavior and it's an a motivator to

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:51,139
induce pro-social reparatory behavior

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:53,870
well okay sure unfortunately what using

00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,910
guilt in the context of diversity does

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,569
is it's s of something called cognitive

00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,849
dissonance people like everyone thinks

00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:05,090
I'm a good person everyone wants to

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:07,010
think I'm a good person if you tell

00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,579
someone oh if you're not doing diversity

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:14,239
you're a bad person there's a dissonance

00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:16,669
between your view of yourself and what

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,690
you're being told how do you resolve

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:22,120
that dissonance you can change your

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:25,240
behavior and

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,699
do more diversity stuff or you can just

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:30,580
reject the message that you're getting

00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:33,160
and say well yeah but I mean what's that

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,720
got to do with running code what's that

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:41,169
got to do with programming I don't want

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,030
to hear about it so it's it's too very

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,150
common ways of dealing with cognitive

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:48,130
dissonance and we're going to take

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,380
questions at the end unless you're

00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:56,910
having trouble right now with a

00:04:50,380 --> 00:05:00,669
particular thing yes we'll get into that

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,240
yeah yeah I'm talking about things like

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:07,630
hiring diverse groups and diverse

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:12,639
individuals or you know having diverse

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:17,280
members of your team things like that so

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:20,110
in diversity discussions in the past

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,620
often you see people either laying guilt

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:27,340
trips on people threatening to

00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:31,840
guilt-trip someone or trying to avoid

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:34,570
guilt and you know I don't like guilt as

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,210
a motivator it just it makes me angry

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,280
when someone tries to use guilt as a

00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:42,010
motivator so I'm going to declare this a

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,710
guilt-free zone for this talk and

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:48,580
hopefully the rest of Europe I thon and

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:51,240
the rest of your discussions with ya the

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:56,949
rest of your life with Python at least

00:05:51,240 --> 00:06:00,039
let's drop the guilt okay I don't like

00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:02,740
when people use diversity as a club to

00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,630
be people with when people say oh well

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,729
you know you don't have enough women on

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,340
your team and therefore you're bad a bad

00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:12,789
team you don't have enough people of

00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,650
color you therefore you're bad I don't

00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:18,550
want to hear it oh you didn't go to the

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:22,500
diversity talk therefore you're a bad

00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:26,289
person you know we're in Florence Italy

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,330
if somebody's not here there's a lot of

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:31,479
really good reasons why they might not

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,689
be here so I don't want to hear about

00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,269
you know

00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,759
aren't here that oh well they don't care

00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:41,569
about diversity we're not going to play

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,669
diversity than dial games yes i love

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:47,269
this Flying Spaghetti Monster and we're

00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:50,749
not going to lay any traps so what we

00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:55,369
are going to talk about is why diversity

00:06:50,749 --> 00:06:58,729
matters and not in the moral terms or

00:06:55,369 --> 00:07:01,159
the political social terms but in terms

00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:04,069
of a question that everyone asks

00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:09,379
themselves when they go to any kind of

00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:11,569
training what's in it for me why should

00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:16,009
I care about this why should i attend

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:18,229
this and because we're at Python no euro

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,769
Python and most of us care about Python

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:24,979
a lot what's in it for Python why should

00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:28,909
the psf create a diversity statement I

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:32,209
mean what's that got to do with code so

00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:35,179
i want to talk about this in terms of

00:07:32,209 --> 00:07:37,399
the title of the talk was diversity as a

00:07:35,179 --> 00:07:39,709
dependency well you know we all know

00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:44,709
about dependencies i remember when i

00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:48,050
first started installing linux and the

00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:50,629
linux cds he would get this CD to

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,909
install it and it didn't tell you what

00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:55,369
the dependencies were you had to go in

00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:58,099
and look at the man page oh well it's a

00:07:55,369 --> 00:08:01,189
linux part of the UNIX blah blah blah

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:04,429
well but what does it do and do I need

00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:08,389
it and sometimes I would guess right and

00:08:04,429 --> 00:08:10,069
sometimes I wouldn't and it would kind

00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:12,139
of limp along but it didn't have the

00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:15,219
right dependency so it would only limp

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,529
along well as far as I'm concerned

00:08:15,219 --> 00:08:21,729
diversity is a dependency for Python and

00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:25,129
I hope that I'll help you understand why

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:27,439
so the rest of the talk we're going to

00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:30,139
go through some studies we're going to

00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,169
I'm going to present a diversity model

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:35,839
to think about diversity and then we're

00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:38,329
going to have some final wrap-up and

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,729
then if you can please hold your

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:42,559
questions till the end because I want

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,479
people to be able to hear the whole talk

00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,310
and then go to

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,000
dinner and if people have questions they

00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:52,060
can stick around okay because you know

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:57,269
it's Italy it's all about the food yes

00:08:52,060 --> 00:09:02,440
Laura okay so let's jump into the talks

00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:06,910
in 1957 Robert K Merton published a talk

00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,850
our study of a small town and what he

00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,810
did was he wanted to find out outside of

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,970
the hierarchy of the town the mayor the

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:20,260
council members things like that who had

00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:22,149
the most influence in that town and so

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,550
the way he went about it was a little

00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:28,180
different what he went and did was check

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:30,190
what newspapers and magazines they were

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:34,050
subscribed to now this was a small town

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:38,079
in America and in the United States and

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:42,279
some people were subscribed to magazines

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:45,459
like life and to newspapers like me out

00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,680
new york times or whatever and some

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:50,949
people were subscribed to the local

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,889
newspaper and maybe you know agriculture

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:57,130
quarterly or something very specific to

00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:59,160
what they did and what he found was that

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,839
the people who actually were the

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,019
influenced the decision making in the

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,079
town and had the most impact in the town

00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:11,199
as far as influence were the ones who he

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,389
labeled as cosmopolitan as opposed to

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:16,350
provincial and the cosmopolitan ones

00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:19,089
were the ones who were subscribed to

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,339
newspapers and magazines outside of the

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:25,029
tongue they brought in ideas from outs

00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:29,490
from the world outside not just focused

00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:31,990
on the inside and so they had a lot more

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,560
perspective and a lot of different ways

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,899
of looking at the things that were being

00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:42,190
discussed in the town and so they had a

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:46,029
lot more influence so from small-town

00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:51,069
America to a big corporation Ronald S

00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:51,680
Burt did a study a huge network analysis

00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:53,000
and I

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,779
this picture I think it looks really

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,690
cool of all the people at thousands and

00:10:56,779 --> 00:11:03,560
thousands of people at this corporation

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:06,230
and he figured out who talked to who and

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,290
who ran ideas by who and things like

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:12,770
that and then he did a network analysis

00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,520
of these different people and what he

00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:20,890
wanted to find out was who is the most

00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:23,540
creative people in this corporation and

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:27,589
so heat we're going to look at one

00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:30,320
little section and if it will go forward

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:32,390
for me oh thank you we're going to look

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,140
at this one little section and see what

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:40,010
you found out now you've got this three

00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:43,870
clusters here among thousands okay and

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:48,470
we've got a person here named James

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:51,980
James is a very popular person he talks

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,170
to a lot of people probably all people

00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,529
in his department maybe even all people

00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:00,380
in his team and doesn't talk to people

00:11:57,529 --> 00:12:02,600
outside of his team or Department very

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:06,650
much you can see who he talks dude

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:10,010
they're all part of an in-group so then

00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:12,140
we've got Robert and Robert over here

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:14,690
talks to some of the same people as

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:18,380
James they're probably in the same

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:22,040
department but he also talks to people

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:25,850
outside of his department across what

00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:29,420
are called structural holes so people

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:30,920
who are outside of the department or

00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,900
different parts of the company or

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,700
different kinds of job titles the

00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:42,500
different silos why does this matter

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:45,430
what Burt did was he looked at they did

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,589
a study they said okay submit ideas

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,300
things for the company things that you

00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:54,910
think the company could do to improve

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:57,589
processes products etc and then he had

00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:00,440
judges both people from inside the

00:12:57,589 --> 00:13:02,900
corporation the top level people in the

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,810
corporation and other judges to say okay

00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,330
how many creative ideas were

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:11,980
what were the most creative and also

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:15,140
what were the most feasible ideas and

00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:21,500
what he found out was that the people

00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:24,260
who had the most contacts across the

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:28,580
structural holes rather than just within

00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:32,840
the in groups were the ones who came up

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:36,230
with the most creative ideas and also

00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,870
the best ideas overall the ones that

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,750
were most feasible they had perspectives

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:47,690
on their problem domain from other

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:50,630
domains on to science science is fun the

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:53,510
most exciting phrase to hear in science

00:13:50,630 --> 00:14:03,820
the one that heralds new discoveries is

00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:05,900
not Eureka but that's funny Isaac Asimov

00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,010
scientists what did they do all they

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:12,860
solve hard problems and one often they

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:15,620
work in labs a lot of them and they a

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:20,240
lot of these problem solving is in lab

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:23,570
meetings so a guy named Dunbar wanted to

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,510
find out how do they do this and what's

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:30,260
the best ways of doing it so what he

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:33,710
found out was that the best discoveries

00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:36,290
came from unexpected results but that

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:39,230
individuals who were working alone

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:42,980
rather than in lab meetings tended to

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:45,710
dismiss the unexpected results much more

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,950
than the lab meetings did but beyond

00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:52,460
that there were differences between

00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:55,790
different labs as far as how well they

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,760
actually made discoveries based on these

00:14:55,790 --> 00:15:01,640
unexpected results and so he wanted to

00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:06,290
discuss figure that out further what he

00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:10,550
found out was the ones who did best used

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:12,740
analogies to explain well maybe the

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,060
unexpected result is because something

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:18,200
like this

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:21,620
and those analogies helped to lead to

00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:25,580
conceptual changes now other than Alex

00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:29,810
and Andrew can somebody tell me what

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:34,100
this is this picture yes exactly Autobot

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:39,370
owes the worm that eats itself what does

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,370
that have to do with science anyone know

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:54,830
yep exactly it was you it was a dream by

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:58,250
someone who was trying to figure out the

00:15:54,830 --> 00:16:01,040
structure of benzene and he had a dream

00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:03,920
of auto botos and that's where he made

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,460
the conceptual leap to what the

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:11,630
structure of benzene was now that's

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:14,360
really cool and what Dunbar did was said

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,850
okay which groups are making the

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,930
conceptual leads here and what he found

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:25,670
was that the people who had different

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:28,640
pools of experience different pools of

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,040
knowledge in their lab were the ones who

00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:33,520
did the best as far as actually

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,860
innovating as far as making make

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:40,330
discoveries the one they were the ones

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:44,750
who were able to bring very different

00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:46,880
knowledge to bear and figure out what

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:52,160
was going on and find out new ways of

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:55,220
approaching problems so we are going to

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,670
review these studies briefly basically

00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,740
what they all come down to these classic

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:03,200
studies these aren't new studies these

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,020
are classic studies in sociology and

00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:10,040
they all point to the same conclusion

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,190
that it's not just that we're going

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:16,970
beyond what individuals can do as a

00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:19,340
group but it's what individuals can

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:23,510
accomplish who are different from each

00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:27,230
other and the benefits extend beyond the

00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:30,650
individuals we're going to unpack this

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:33,500
statement this is from a book called the

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,900
difference and it's by someone named

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,510
Scott page and i highly recommend that

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,620
you read it it's a really well-done book

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:45,049
on diversity and how diversity improves

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:49,160
creativity and innovation in companies

00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:52,669
and schools and business but we're going

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:56,179
to unpack this a little bit so there's

00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:58,490
different kinds of diversity this is

00:17:56,179 --> 00:18:02,330
what I'm talking about when I'm talking

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:05,559
about diversity I'm talking about these

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:09,200
aspects of these different

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:11,049
characteristics of individuals people

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,790
have different needs and motivations

00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:16,640
they have different skill sets and they

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:19,549
have different perspectives you know

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:25,040
what you notice what's not on here is

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:27,890
things like gender rates identity all of

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,870
the usual diversity stuff that you hear

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,740
about when you're at diversity training

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,120
or talking about diversity on lists

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:38,480
that's not on here we're going to talk

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,910
about that later but what if those

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,260
things I was talking with Andrew earlier

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:47,480
and those things are more of a proxy for

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:51,919
these characteristics which is what we

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:55,040
want in our groups in our teams in our

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,160
open source projects in Python the

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,010
Python community so when we're talking

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,350
about what's in it for me and what's in

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,940
it for Python we want to talk about

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,309
these characteristics now how many

00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:12,860
people here have contributed to python

00:19:07,309 --> 00:19:16,990
raise your hands okay how many of you

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,990
done have done any of this

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:28,270
Wow we know Laura's done all of these

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:31,180
button okay now let's think about why

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,850
you did those things whatever those

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:36,000
things are by the way you are here at

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:39,610
euro Python you are there for

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,170
contributing to the Python community so

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:45,400
thank you for contributing to python

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,400
we're here because we're scratching an

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:52,120
itch we do these things because we're

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,940
scratching an itch individuals have

00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:57,700
different inches to scratch now we need

00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:00,760
people like Laura Creighton and the pipe

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:03,310
I group to create a small flexible

00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,190
Python because they want a small

00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:09,310
flexible Python we need people like Tim

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:12,640
Peters who is like really really into

00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:15,730
sorting algorithms to figure out the Tim

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:18,130
sort we need people like Raymond

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,080
Hechinger who's like really really into

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,500
speed to create things like get her

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,570
tools and we'll make Python faster so

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,640
you know we need a lot of different

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,310
kinds of people here we need the people

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:35,140
who can organize conferences I mean good

00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:37,030
grief Wow one of the objections that

00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,190
people have when we were talking about

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,880
well we need these different kinds of

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:46,350
people is well isn't that going to just

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:51,220
cater to special interest groups and

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:53,820
what's in it for everybody so there's

00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:57,130
this concept called universal design and

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,270
it's I think a really good thing to keep

00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,180
in mind when you're thinking about

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:05,170
diversity how many people have used a

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:09,640
curb cut on your way here with a rolly

00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:12,430
bag walking through the streets to be

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:16,540
able to get here without having to go

00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:20,920
bumping up and down the curbs if you've

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:23,680
taken a bicycle up and down a curb curb

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,370
cuts are really helpful if anybody our

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,410
parents and you've pushed a stroller

00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:31,780
curb cuts are really helpful

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,000
curb cuts were not created for these

00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:37,690
purposes they were created for people

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,360
who are in wheelchairs but a lot of us

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:44,410
find it really helpful to have curb cuts

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:47,710
for totally other reasons text to speech

00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:49,570
I have it on my kindle and i love it

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:52,510
when I'm driving and I want to keep

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:55,090
reading the book that I'm reading and it

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:57,270
can just tell me the stuff it wasn't

00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,640
created for that it was created so that

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:03,640
people with visual impairments or who

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,880
are blind can also read the book but

00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,010
it's helpful for everyone subtitles and

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,440
captions I mean look at this audience

00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,870
how many people here find those to be

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,340
really really helpful even when you're

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,910
watching a movie in your own language

00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,250
with dialects or strong accents I find

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,560
it really helpful it's also very helpful

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:26,670
for people who are hard of hearing but

00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,950
just because it was created to solve one

00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:33,160
particular problem doesn't mean that it

00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,990
doesn't extend beyond to a whole lot of

00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,140
other people and if you do design right

00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,900
by solving by scratching these edges

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:42,160
you're going to actually end up

00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:45,730
scratching a lot of itches that you

00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:51,330
didn't even know about so differing

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:54,520
skill sets we are not all going to be

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:59,170
attackers we're not all going to be

00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:03,310
goalkeepers but these people are both

00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:05,740
really great soccer players just because

00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:07,090
you're hiring people are looking for

00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,070
people on your projects who have

00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,770
different skill sets doesn't mean that

00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:14,460
you're going to compromise your desire

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:17,470
for people who are really really good at

00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,320
Python it just means that you want

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:22,570
people who have different skill sets

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,360
because that's what's going to make your

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:28,780
team great that's what's going to get

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:32,620
you to have the best possible outcome

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:35,020
that you could possibly have

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,570
so we all have different skill sets that

00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,350
we bring to python not everyone can give

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:44,440
a talk like Alex not everyone can you

00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,360
know explain human factors like Fitz not

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:50,740
everyone can organize a conference with

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:57,160
this kind of food did i mention that i

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:58,950
really appreciate the food so skill sets

00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,540
we all have different skill sets

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,750
perspectives we all come from different

00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,690
perspectives and this is where identity

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,340
and gender and race and all of those

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,650
things that you usually think of as

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:15,790
diversity where they really come into

00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:18,580
play because they're basically a proxy

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:22,929
for different perspectives growing up as

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:26,080
a female in Minnesota I have a very

00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:32,620
different perspective than growing up

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:34,990
male in Italy or as someone in Germany

00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,860
or someone I didn't grow up in rural

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:42,600
areas I didn't go to a rural college so

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:45,610
my perspective on you know for example

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,400
networking I had broadband pretty early

00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:50,230
not everyone does someone who had to

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,970
live with dial-up for a long time is

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,900
going to have a different perspective

00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,970
than someone who lives on broadband I

00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:08,500
think we all have a little perspective

00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:11,140
on that here sorry ah so we all have

00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,870
different perspectives and that's based

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:15,940
on our different backgrounds on things

00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:19,929
like the college we went to or if we

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:22,929
went to college on whether we where we

00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:26,590
grew up and how we grew up and our own

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:31,210
identities those perspectives affect

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:35,140
problem solving so when I started out in

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:38,170
Python Alex said that programming is for

00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,510
people who really love problem solving

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,080
because there's always so many problems

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,080
to solve

00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:49,419
and you know we all approach problems in

00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:52,269
different ways and we may even see

00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:54,489
different problems if you are in the

00:25:52,269 --> 00:26:01,509
United States you may not care about

00:25:54,489 --> 00:26:03,929
internet internationalization until you

00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:05,859
get someone who cares about

00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:09,239
internationalization and wants to

00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:14,739
scratch that itch and then they fix it

00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:16,929
will see different solutions so what I

00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:20,739
want you to understand is diversity

00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:24,070
matters and it's not just for the moral

00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:27,580
reasons the political reasons it's the

00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:29,799
very pragmatic reasons all those

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:34,719
different ways that people contribute to

00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:37,419
Python those are the reasons diversity

00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:41,080
matters the reasons that each one of you

00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:42,789
are here is why diversity matters we all

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:45,429
have those different needs and

00:26:42,789 --> 00:26:48,099
motivations those different skill sets

00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:51,519
and those different perspectives and

00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:55,539
those together generate the innovation

00:26:51,519 --> 00:27:00,539
and creative problem solving which leads

00:26:55,539 --> 00:27:02,769
to better software now in my view as

00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:04,989
Raymond mentioned that python is a

00:27:02,769 --> 00:27:06,580
really awesome language as far as I'm

00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:12,190
concerned pythons already the best

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:18,399
programming language but it's not quite

00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:21,159
the best language it can be yet for

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,259
Python to be the best language we need

00:27:21,159 --> 00:27:25,929
all those different inches those

00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:28,269
different skill sets and perspectives we

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:31,749
need all of those different things

00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:34,989
brought to bear on Python to make it

00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:36,729
what it needs to be out there not just

00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:42,249
the people who are here but the people

00:27:36,729 --> 00:27:45,999
who aren't here it's necessary it's not

00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:47,710
sufficient though because diversity is

00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:49,210
hard you can't just grab around a bunch

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,759
of people throw them in a room and

00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,919
expect miracles because you know you

00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,299
can't even expect them all to just get

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,730
along

00:27:55,299 --> 00:28:00,710
you can't expect them to communicate

00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:04,640
with each other look at the difference

00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:08,419
in usage of the word table in British

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,090
versus American English Oscar Wilde i

00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:13,190
think it was said that the Brits and the

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:18,289
Americans are divided by a common

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:22,610
language if you look at tabling in 12

00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:26,059
table some topic means to discuss it

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:31,460
right now in the other it means no we'll

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:33,320
discuss it later if you are never if you

00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,190
don't know about that difference in

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,409
you're going to have trouble

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:39,799
communicating even if you're speaking

00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:43,429
theoretically the same language we have

00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:46,490
different goals and priorities passwords

00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:50,750
are an example of this your password has

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:53,030
to have at least 10 different characters

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:57,470
you have to have an uppercase letter a

00:28:53,030 --> 00:29:00,440
lowercase letter a number and a special

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:03,110
character no words that are in the

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:07,580
dictionary oh and it has to be memorable

00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:10,970
because you can't write it down I'm

00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:14,659
sorry I can't do all of those things at

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:17,120
once usability and security are

00:29:14,659 --> 00:29:20,330
different goals and priorities they're

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:22,549
both important but um yeah you need to

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:24,140
be able to balance those and you need to

00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:28,210
have people who are thinking about both

00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:31,190
of them in order to find a way through

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:34,730
we have to be able to value those other

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:36,950
perspectives and skill sets one of the

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,340
very common things that I hear from

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:44,000
people is oh well it's just

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:45,530
documentation or it's just usability

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,110
will will talk to the user interface

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:51,470
people later and right now we're just

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:53,240
trying to get it to work well yeah it

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:57,049
works better if you talk to them at the

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,880
beginning and then you don't have it as

00:29:57,049 --> 00:30:03,200
just like this little thing you stuck on

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:06,080
at the end I'm so glad to see some of

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,800
the awards that were given on things

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,400
like community

00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:17,520
like documentation and it's nice to see

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:19,770
that Python values those things so how

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,840
do you do it is if it's so hard how do

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,490
you do it well you have things like

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,660
education education like talking about

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,000
diversity at conferences like this

00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:33,000
bringing up cultural differences things

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,270
like that to facilitate the

00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:40,110
communication you set up clear processes

00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:42,390
and goal setting things like the peps we

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:45,480
have that already in python we're ahead

00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:49,710
of the game here we have clear decision

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:53,820
making as Raymond said you got a problem

00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:55,530
with lambdas talk to the BD FL and you

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,500
need people who are willing to work on

00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:01,170
it I want to have you think about a

00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:05,070
thought experiment for me you have to

00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:08,990
create a web app ok it's got to work in

00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:12,480
firefox and safari and opera and links

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:19,080
yes some people still use links oz isn't

00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:21,690
here but netbooks mobile phones both

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:27,630
iPhone and Android at oh and by the way

00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:29,430
blackberry to can't forget them and yes

00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:35,280
it actually does have to work in

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:38,940
internet explorer so all of those

00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:42,390
different requirements they're kind of a

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:47,100
pain in the butt to achieve all of those

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:52,560
at once and that's when you've got api's

00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:56,370
and SDKs and docks and specs and help

00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:59,970
forums and books and design patterns and

00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:02,070
all of these resources just to help you

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:07,410
to be able to communicate cross-platform

00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:11,360
and across browsers well people are

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:15,090
harder every single person in here and

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,670
every single person you meet as a

00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:21,830
different OS

00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:30,330
a different chipset a different browser

00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:34,710
and we don't come with docs so Wow some

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:37,530
software yeah so when you hear about

00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:41,340
things like the psf getting together to

00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:43,500
write a diversity statement or even just

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,790
you know a mailing list to discuss

00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:50,130
diversity issues if you it might help if

00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:52,740
you think about that is creating docs

00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,230
for people and you might understand why

00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,440
Pete why they're doing it because people

00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:01,620
are hard and the more we discuss things

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,860
like this and the more we actually write

00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:07,740
things down and hammer it out the better

00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,830
we'll be at being able to harness the

00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:14,070
diversity that we need to make python

00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:15,660
the best programming language not just

00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,910
the best programming language out there

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:22,440
but the best programming language that

00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:26,250
it can possibly be for everybody and yes

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,820
Damon Conway who's a pearl guy that has

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,230
good ideas anyway speaking of diversity

00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:36,690
says you can never go wrong with kittens

00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:39,050
so there's my diversity statement thank

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,050
you all

00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:58,470
ok questions answers dinner that was

00:33:54,330 --> 00:34:00,600
quick that was quick no no that question

00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:03,000
and answers actually yeah okay hey

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:09,530
nobody spoke up so must be dinner time

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:16,409
any question I have a question so oh

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:18,690
good besides all the more really so

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:24,300
every every diversity is important but

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:25,889
one of the main ones that programming in

00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,859
general is dealing with right now is

00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:31,679
that there aren't a lot of women in the

00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:33,540
do programming and in general in the

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,310
field of Technology remember in my

00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:43,710
university class over 2800 students I

00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:47,580
think about 50 where where women and how

00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:51,300
do you why do you think this is and if

00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:54,020
you can give that answer and how do you

00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,850
think by the Python community can can

00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,480
change if it needs to change in order to

00:34:56,850 --> 00:35:03,450
get to capture all those 50 women in

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,540
their course so they all come they all

00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:10,890
come to your Python okay well first off

00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:15,660
I actually did a paper at Stanford on

00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:19,410
women in programming and in order to do

00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:21,210
this one of the things that I did for my

00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:26,540
research was borrow something called the

00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:31,730
encyclopedia of IT and gender

00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:39,960
perspectives or sun at 1,200 pages of

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:42,210
research on gender and IT arm it I know

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,290
how big it is it's two volumes because I

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:49,380
had to carry at home in my bicycle and

00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:53,609
that's just one of the resources out

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:55,470
there everyone is studying this everyone

00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,690
is trying there was an article on the

00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,280
airplane riding over here from what was

00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:06,000
it the Financial Times

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:09,090
women in IT and how it's just as bad if

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,360
not worse I don't have any answers to

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:18,560
that unfortunately I wish I did i do

00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:24,380
know that python as a community is very

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:28,950
open and welcoming to everyone and that

00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:32,730
the kinds of things that we do really

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:36,300
help us to capture those people if you

00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:39,120
expand the view of IT though not just to

00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:43,470
programming but two things like web

00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:47,550
design arm and some of those other kind

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:50,280
of fringe areas you actually see a lot

00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:54,360
more women at some of those things the

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,190
user interface the HCI classes i went to

00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:59,070
the human-computer interface classes i

00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:03,870
went to it stanford work at least half

00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:07,790
women the educational technology classes

00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:10,680
were at least half women it was just the

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:14,940
computer science classes that were less

00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,970
than that but it still wasn't like empty

00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,210
it was you know it still wasn't no women

00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:23,940
it was less though maybe more like

00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:25,770
twenty percent but there are women out

00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,660
there there are women interested there's

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:32,550
also some really awesome community

00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:35,550
events going on training classes that

00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:40,200
are focused on being open to new bees

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:42,030
that are specified that women we want

00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:47,460
you to come here and learn Python and

00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:50,580
they're being swamped there's rails Ruby

00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:52,980
on Rails the rails group kind of started

00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,660
some of this stuff and there's a bunch

00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,280
of Python east as who got together and

00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,270
said you know that's a really good idea

00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:02,250
and started doing it part of it is just

00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:05,910
the perception of computers are guy

00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:08,370
stuff hopefully with more of the social

00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:11,350
networking stuff and PN kids growing up

00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:14,770
with computers these days the

00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:18,610
computers as a meal preserve will die

00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:21,070
out the death that it should be women

00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:23,290
are using computers there can they're

00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,090
comfortable my daughter is 20 she

00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:27,220
doesn't consider herself a geek even

00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,830
though she lives on the computer I don't

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,320
quite understand how this works but I

00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:35,740
mean she writes HTML as a native

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:41,320
language and she thinks in HTML but I'm

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:43,930
not a geek yeah okay if you say so so I

00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:47,770
don't have any answers to how to get

00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:50,020
more women into computer science I wish

00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:53,560
I did but on the other hand i am going

00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:56,160
to be at the Grace Hopper celebration of

00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,040
women in computing where there are like

00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,820
several thousand women who do computing

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,490
and there's a lot of us out there we're

00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:09,010
just not as visible as we need to be so

00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:12,370
hopefully we'll just get more women out

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:15,550
there doing presentations so that it's

00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:18,430
more obvious that we're here and I hope

00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:23,740
that the women at this conference hear

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:25,450
that and put in presentation what do you

00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:29,680
call it when they do request for

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:32,380
proposals put in proposals because we'd

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,790
like to hear from you not just me I

00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,500
don't like being the only woman up here

00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,810
talking I want more are you women out

00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:48,810
here talking because you got good ideas

00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:48,810
to anybody else yes and second and bear

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:57,230
I can offer an answer to both parts of

00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:59,750
those questionable great um not that I

00:39:57,230 --> 00:40:01,130
know anything from research but I think

00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,690
a lot of the reason why women aren't

00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:05,930
involved in programming is purely

00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:08,870
cultural before I was a programmer I was

00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:11,720
a jazz trumpet player and cool there are

00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:13,040
no women in the chest trumpet world but

00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,510
there are plenty of women who are

00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,640
professional musicians either in

00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:18,830
classical or playing other instruments

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:22,850
and its really clear to me that that

00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:26,090
particular divide is is purely cultural

00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:28,190
women don't play trumpet right people

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,300
here that I I meet people I tell them I

00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,070
play trumpet and the next time they see

00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:38,270
me they asked me about my flute playing

00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:41,450
I mean it's amazing and I think in terms

00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:45,440
of I think people in general men or

00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:48,080
women are just by their nature likely to

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,030
go into something that seems expected of

00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,340
them and it in that's just through

00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:56,330
millions of tiny choices that you make

00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:58,160
throughout your life I'm actually

00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:00,980
involved with one of the Python Easter

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,280
groups in Boston that is organizing

00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:08,000
these training classes for women and

00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,980
they are in fact always packed and we do

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,900
hope to get women past that point of

00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,540
sort of trying Python and get them into

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:18,880
the actually you know using Python and

00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:21,080
becoming Python programmers so I think I

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,190
totally agree that I think a lot of it

00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:27,290
is that women are not visible in the

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,630
community and women are women

00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:32,240
programmers are also not visible outside

00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,130
of the community so so other women who

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,400
aren't part of a programming community

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,050
don't realize that women program and

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:41,270
they only see men who are programmers

00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,970
and so I think it just feeds into itself

00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:48,230
yeah and we're going to have a proposal

00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:52,450
from you for next year right oh good yay

00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:52,450
and are you going to be at Austin Oh

00:41:52,930 --> 00:42:00,410
next year

00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:02,690
we want you there next year um hey Laura

00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,270
I there's just that was actually the way

00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:08,300
the question was phrased is why aren't

00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:12,980
there women in computing or something

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:15,530
like that as if there is a reason that

00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,079
there aren't and we could change the

00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:20,150
reason and then the women would show up

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:22,250
and that's probably the wrong way to

00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:24,050
look at it because the way you look the

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,240
way people who are studying this have

00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,980
discovered is the reason they're not

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,460
there is because there aren't any women

00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:33,079
there that is the reason the way you you

00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:35,180
way you get it to change is to put more

00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,800
women in and then more will show up but

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,500
it's not like you can't sit around

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,359
saying what are we doing wrong because

00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,859
there aren't any women here what you're

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,589
doing wrong is you don't have any women

00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:47,540
here that that is let's is what you're

00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:49,010
doing wrong so you don't need you don't

00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,109
need to go around and listen to people

00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:53,150
who will tell you nine million ways to

00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:55,010
feel guilty about yourself because there

00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:59,359
must be something hideously wrong with

00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:02,869
you oh no the reason I don't show up is

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:07,280
that now the really neat thing and is

00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:09,770
that if you wanna do show up there's a

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,329
threshold and there are people who i

00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,890
believe who think twenty percent of the

00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,359
community is threshold and they're

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,490
arguing with some other people and who'd

00:43:14,359 --> 00:43:19,069
say thirty percent is the threshold and

00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:20,599
they're having lovely academic arguments

00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:22,329
which you can read about in great detail

00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,040
but some are up there is the threshold

00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:28,490
and what you get that many women in you

00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,280
can you can you can't keep them away and

00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:32,329
in universities they'll end up you'll

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,550
end up with your classes being

00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:36,079
sixty-five percent women because more

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,329
women than men show up for universities

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,040
for things so in sweden unlike other

00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:41,750
click where I live unlike other places

00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:44,359
of the world if you go to any university

00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:46,069
and you go to chemistry you will find a

00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:48,920
classroom is absolutely packed full of

00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:50,060
women well it doesn't mean they're

00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:51,560
studying physics and they aren't

00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:54,470
studying anything else and things like

00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,819
this so the Swedish educational

00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:57,230
establishment is busy trying to figure

00:43:55,819 --> 00:43:58,460
out how the hell that happened because

00:43:57,230 --> 00:44:02,060
they'd love to make it happen someplace

00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,520
else and the answer really does seem to

00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:07,069
be that because of really rotten

00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,790
economic times a whole bunch of women

00:44:07,069 --> 00:44:09,230
decided

00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,000
they would get master's degrees and

00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,040
sciences because they thought it would

00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,460
be a good place to get a career and

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,820
bunches them decided to go together to

00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:22,750
chemistry for we still have no clue why

00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:27,230
and all it took was having them there

00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:29,420
for tons and tons of people to continue

00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:31,820
to show up so University of linkoping

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:34,690
which is in Sweden decided there wasn't

00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:38,600
enough women in computer science and

00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:42,350
decided to take on the theory it's just

00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:44,000
because they aren't there and test it so

00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:47,270
they took their computer science course

00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,650
and they tossed out three courses that

00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:51,170
were known to be particularly

00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:54,770
mathematical and mostly about touring

00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:56,390
machines and which were universally

00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,090
thought to be not of particular

00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:00,650
relevance to the modern world and then I

00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:02,450
went to ask a whole bunch of people what

00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:04,280
they think we should put in there and

00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:07,100
they discovered everybody wanted to do

00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:10,190
web design and and using the internet

00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:11,960
and pictures and graphics need stuff

00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:13,880
like this so they and that's everybody

00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:15,980
not just the women yeah they asked

00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,810
everybody and so they put a whole bunch

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,550
of this in that and then they called it

00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:21,080
a noose that's new sexy name which I

00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:26,510
can't remember what it was but it wasn't

00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:28,460
computer science but it was interaction

00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:31,070
design I intermediate studies or

00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:32,840
something like this but but if you look

00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:34,490
at the course it felt really a lot like

00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,290
the computer science course that they

00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:39,350
had before it just had a new name on the

00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:42,290
outside and a whole lot of women showed

00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:44,180
up and even more showed up next year and

00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:46,790
even more showed up the year after that

00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:51,040
until now I'm reading papers say we got

00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:53,300
a problem we've got too many women study

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,800
classes and some people are feeling

00:45:53,300 --> 00:46:01,730
uncomfortable because there aren't

00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:03,770
enough men so um so I don't think you

00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:06,590
should sit around trying to find out

00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,660
what's wrong with you and what are we

00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:13,550
doing wrong because we may not be doing

00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:17,240
anything wrong yeah it's just we need to

00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:19,490
change this but it's a in the past not

00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:21,830
enough women decided it would be a

00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,630
we'll thing to do but not enough women

00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,060
decided to recall play the trumpet

00:46:23,630 --> 00:46:28,190
either you know that's a it's not it's

00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:30,770
not it's not because trumpeters though I

00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:38,060
used to be married to what um a really

00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:40,220
really creepy people you know it's it's

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:42,230
just the way it's just the way the

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,119
demographic is and and the way you

00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:46,400
change the demographic is to change the

00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:48,140
demographic not let's change something

00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:53,290
else and hope the demographic will

00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:53,290
respond to it you just go out after it

00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,550
yeah laura has a great point there i

00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:11,750
mean one of the things that I've seen

00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:13,550
happen at conferences is that women and

00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,580
I've got a whole different talk on women

00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:18,980
in programming but women will show up

00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,690
and be the only person they the only

00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:23,060
woman who shows up to the conference and

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:25,340
not see any other women and because

00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:27,320
there are the only woman they don't come

00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:29,570
back the next year and the next year

00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,220
some other woman shows up and they're

00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:34,520
the only woman there and so they don't

00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:37,820
come back the next year and this goes on

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,250
and so the way as she said the way to

00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:43,220
get more women to show up is to drag a

00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:46,160
woman here and say so that you've got a

00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:49,750
lot of women here and you Charlie on the

00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:49,750
website we have women

00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:59,660
getting women as speakers inviting women

00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:02,810
as speakers if you don't get enough

00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:06,710
proposals from women going specifically

00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:09,860
to the women's groups and saying please

00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:12,350
submit proposals we want them can help

00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:15,110
you to get more women speakers or

00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:17,990
there's more visibility but it's not

00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:21,320
just about women it's about all sorts of

00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:23,600
forms of diversity but women is one of

00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:26,420
them are visible versions you had a

00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:31,130
question this is the last last question

00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:34,730
okay last question and then food oh okay

00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:37,970
but scientists are good at doing

00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:40,370
experiments on people and like studies

00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:44,480
around the universities from nisha

00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:47,900
peeing or whatever so wouldn't that make

00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,920
be a great case to sponsor access to

00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:58,070
women act act like like googled asked to

00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:01,340
be women up oh so you know why don't you

00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:03,620
like as community take a bit sound the

00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:06,530
money some of the nation's and just you

00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:09,940
know ship a bunch of women to Europe

00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,940
item to put it bluntly

00:49:10,069 --> 00:49:17,099
boy that sounds interesting but

00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:19,950
seriously if there's like good science

00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:25,530
behind these things why don't we just

00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:27,750
you know do it through science okay so i

00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:33,290
think the suggestion of scholarships

00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:37,500
specifically targeted at women and other

00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:40,829
minority groups is a good one minorities

00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:43,410
as in minorities at the conference and I

00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:46,890
think the psf has actually looked at

00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:50,130
things like that and I know for you I

00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:52,680
know yap I ladies got a grant I know at

00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:55,589
PyCon they've had a couple of targeted

00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:59,309
grants things like that so we are

00:49:55,589 --> 00:50:03,859
working on it and we just need to do

00:49:59,309 --> 00:50:07,680
more and we do encourage all of you to

00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:11,339
bring if you are a woman or a man bring

00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:14,819
someone unlike you to the conference

00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:16,829
whatever that unlike you is and if

00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:19,799
that's someone who speaks another

00:50:16,829 --> 00:50:22,049
language someone who is done the other

00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:25,109
gender someone who is another raise

00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:26,790
someone who is just went to a completely

00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:29,490
different kind of college than you did

00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:31,770
whatever that difference is bring

00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:36,000
someone different from you to the next

00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:39,319
euro Python or the next PyCon or to the

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:42,569
next you know sprint that you go to and

00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:44,549
our user group and just encourage them

00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:47,010
to get involved and let them know that

00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:50,059
they're welcome there and I think that

00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:50,059
will help

00:50:54,299 --> 00:50:56,359
