thank you well my name is Ben elliptica

00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:21,930
i'm working at the th2 riccati in the IT

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:24,850
services and this is one line that

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:28,930
contributes to my interests and my

00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:33,100
engagement the outline is my scientific

00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,309
background I first studied physics and

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:40,000
after that I've studied culture and

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:45,100
topology and after that I made I PhD in

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:49,180
business economics my talk today is not

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:53,860
a pestle not a technical talk I never

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:58,989
dare to hold such a presentation on a

00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:01,500
Java conference for example but I've got

00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:05,979
the experience that the Python community

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,069
is very open-minded and that's the

00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,899
reason why I submitted to this talk

00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,090
about the political implications of

00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:16,179
having fun while programming open source

00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:20,340
and you voted for me and that's the

00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:23,529
reason I am here thank you i enjoyed the

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,789
under Ravencroft talk about diversity

00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:30,729
are lost and I see this talk kind of a

00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:35,590
completion in merrier in various aspects

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:37,689
to another presentation some of you may

00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:40,979
have heard the presentation yesterday

00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:45,279
about the building complex web

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,669
applications and having fun and also

00:01:45,279 --> 00:01:53,679
this talk is a kind of an add on to that

00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:59,439
talk obviously fun is an issue in the in

00:01:53,679 --> 00:02:02,859
the Pythian community starting from

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:06,489
oneself from the experience as one has

00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:09,819
made entity IES one has developed this

00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:12,239
always a good yet good idea but then you

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:15,160
have to pay attention not to generalize

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,850
you might be you might be very

00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:21,910
unique and then your IDs are not shared

00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:25,630
by anybody or you might be bloody normal

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:28,980
and then your ideas are shared by

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:32,110
everybody but also something in between

00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,310
to find out the correct numbers you have

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,950
to make a research that's what I've made

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:41,680
I've made the experience that I enjoy

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:45,070
software yellow developing most of the

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,290
time and always again therefore I

00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:50,890
wondered whether this experience holds

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:54,010
only for me on the contrary is true for

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,440
other people too that's why I started my

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,770
PhD research on motivations of

00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,580
open-source programmers my hypothesis

00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:05,740
was that fun is an important driver and

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:10,540
may explain a lot of this interesting

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:19,380
phenomenon so what kind of fun are we

00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:19,380
talking about I show you oops a movie

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:37,320
some of you may have seen this movie

00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:37,320
before to enjoy it and then

00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:55,220
yeah obviously this is kind of funny but

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,099
it's if we look at this movie twice or

00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,670
more times it's a superficial kind of

00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:03,680
fun it's a rather malicious pleasure on

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,430
the shoulders of this poor man in the

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,609
movie and thinking about this movie

00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:13,970
twice I think even the programmer that

00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:17,180
produced the software that drove the man

00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,549
in the movie so crazy even this program

00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:25,789
el programa didn't have much fun during

00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:29,090
his work so I others have a different

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:31,570
phone in mind when I talk about fun it's

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,560
a kind of fun the psychologist

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:39,199
csikszentmihalyi described was low and

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:44,330
the flow is continued by five by six

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,849
points according to the his research the

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:49,610
first is a concentration and focusing

00:04:46,849 --> 00:04:52,430
that means a high degree of

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:55,580
concentration limited field of attention

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,729
a person engaged in the activity that

00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,889
creates the flow experience we have the

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:05,120
opportunity to focus and self into it

00:05:02,889 --> 00:05:07,240
fixed a loss of feeling of

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,500
self-consciousness this means that

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:15,860
action and awareness are merged when

00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,070
you're in the flow state next distorted

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,770
sense of time that's what I experienced

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,409
solo all the time and I'm developing

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:27,590
that is the subject subjective

00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:29,870
experience of time is altered you don't

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:35,210
know how many hours passed while you've

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:37,250
been in the low state next control and

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,370
high level of absorption you have a

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:45,800
sense of full personal control over the

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:48,889
situation and activity the next point is

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,240
all so very important clear goals and

00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:53,300
immediate feedback

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,599
you know what you have to do and when

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:59,479
you have achieved it if you failed you

00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:02,810
can adjust your behavior as needed and

00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:05,300
immediately and you can add the new

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,759
iteration for photo for that you can

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:14,300
succeed and not stop the action with a

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:17,150
frustration experience next point the

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:20,690
last point is the flow of actions this

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:23,780
means that each step leads fluently to

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:27,650
the next as if demons are led by an

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:30,830
inner logic but that such a flow state

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:33,280
can happen such a flow experience you

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:37,130
need two important prerequisites that

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,800
govern the situation the vs. attention

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:43,699
focusing the attention has to be focused

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,120
on a limited field of stimulus there

00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:49,849
must be no danger of destruction and the

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,789
second more important point they must be

00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:55,130
our balance between avail our ability

00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:58,009
level and challenge the perceived

00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,550
requirements have to be in balance with

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:05,210
the person's ability level we ask both

00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:08,960
requirements and the person's abilities

00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:11,659
have to be over average the actors V in

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,719
this objectives you both too high

00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:16,840
challenges that leads to anxiety or too

00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:20,090
low challenges that leads to boredom

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:26,509
will kill the flow experience and will

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:29,360
lead to frustration instead based on

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,400
that understanding of fun I've designed

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,830
my study I developed an online

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,560
questionnaire with which with which I've

00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:38,180
been able to measure the software

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,090
developers engagement in open source

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:46,240
projects depending upon their available

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:49,880
time and depending upon hung by their

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:53,150
programming so we have to input

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,819
variables the idea of this approach is

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,089
to look at the variance of the dependent

00:07:55,819 --> 00:08:02,389
variable in my case da engagement in the

00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:04,449
open source projects and to look how

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:07,960
much this variant scholarly

00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:09,999
with the input variables and the

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,629
statistical methods to achieve this is

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:15,129
called regression analysis I posted this

00:08:13,629 --> 00:08:19,900
questionnaire to the open source

00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:25,300
community in 2004 and I got response 8

00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:28,029
of 1330 build forms at the same time I

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,339
did an analogous questionnaire we fina

00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:35,380
six software companies in Switzerland

00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:43,570
and this yielded I response rate of 114

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:45,870
forms no match for the study design is

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:50,970
the mathematical formulation of my

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:54,329
hypothesis I tied to the test the

00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:57,820
dependent variable engagement as

00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:00,720
function of the programmers fun and his

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:04,480
available time we need both of the

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:09,000
independent variables because if you

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:12,120
don't have available time you can't do

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:17,100
an engagement in open source projects

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:21,850
though you will need the the time and

00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:24,850
I've modeled the equation with quadratic

00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:27,300
terms having negative sign in the

00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,560
quadratic term to express the

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:33,040
diminishing marginal effect of an

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,010
additional unique with this model I've

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,410
been able to explain between 27 and

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:44,260
thirty-two percent of the variance that

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:47,579
means my explanation is relevant fun is

00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:51,279
relevant to explain the open source

00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:53,649
programmers engagement but it lets room

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,970
for additional explanations of this

00:09:53,649 --> 00:10:01,329
phenomenon and add an additional insight

00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:07,889
i got if you look at the results table

00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:11,910
there's no quadratic term of the fun

00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:16,089
variable and that means that means that

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,670
one doesn't veer off we don't have

00:10:16,089 --> 00:10:22,170
an additional unit of honestly Natalie

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:26,910
transformed into a get into engagement

00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:30,490
that's for the basic results of my study

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:33,519
I've been able to create more insights

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,610
looking at different subsamples in my

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,309
some sample I got I could identify a

00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:42,129
significant difference between hackers

00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:44,860
and professionals and when I say about

00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:46,870
hackers I mean developers who do

00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,360
open-source programming mostly during

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,240
their spare time well as programmers

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,430
professionals developers who do

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,410
open-source programming mostly during at

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:01,689
work and they are paid for their work

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,360
the difference I've identified is that

00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:07,839
hackers hackers have more fun while

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:11,620
programming though this is kind of

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,740
interesting you may say this is a not

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:19,290
surprising hackers open source

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:21,999
developers have more fun as a commercial

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:24,129
programmers but if you look at the

00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:26,379
activity the activity software

00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:28,480
programming is the same so what's the

00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:32,610
difference the difference is in the

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:38,769
context something in the context makes

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:41,499
less the same activity less fun and in

00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:46,029
the commercial context and therefore i

00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:50,470
looked at the context and i was able to

00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:54,249
identify five traits we're open source

00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,290
and commercial projects differ when I

00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:59,110
talk about open source software here

00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,959
I'll assume that the contributors have

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:06,850
freely chosen to contribute to the

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:09,610
project and that they do they

00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:13,329
contribution in the spare time the

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:16,199
hackers view that given such open source

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:19,929
projects usually have a project vision

00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:21,939
because that's the basis upon which the

00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:26,939
hackers the open-source contributor

00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:29,450
chooses to engage in this project and

00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:33,190
also such

00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:36,460
projects provide optimal challenge

00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:39,170
because the programmer the hacker

00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:43,280
contributes exactly what is able to do

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:46,370
and what he finds interesting because

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:51,140
unless he is not a masochist we will not

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:54,100
do something he lands boring at least

00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:58,280
maybe as of the developers here

00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:01,940
programming other programming languages

00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:07,130
but for sure not the Python programmers

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:09,080
they know masochists much open source

00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,540
projects usually have no deadlines

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:15,680
because you can't impose deadlines on

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:18,890
projects with a contributors work for

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,470
the project in their spare time touch

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:23,690
pro text don't have formal Authority

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:27,320
instead authority is based on

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:29,930
professional qualification the projects

00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,140
don't offer monetary incentives that

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:37,250
could Institute constitute formal

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,020
Authority when you paid a software

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:42,560
programmer for open or closed source

00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:47,030
projects the project's urine might or

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,990
might not have a vision but at reason I

00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:52,670
have a question mark in this column the

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,700
same holds for the optimal challenge

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,830
they provide we participate in the

00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,380
software project because you paid to do

00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:05,480
so the formal authority commands you to

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:08,030
do so my data allowed me to calculate

00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:11,810
relations between the one the promised

00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:14,720
experience for the first four criterias

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:19,310
I could not calculate the effects of

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,190
monetary incentives on one so the

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:25,420
correlation analysis I've made yielded

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:28,490
the foreign following result i

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:30,670
calculated highly significant

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:34,220
correlations between project vision

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:37,960
between optimal challenge deadlines on

00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:41,120
the one side and found on the other side

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,529
the existence or absence of formal

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,709
authority didn't

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:55,910
like a fun experience that what this

00:14:45,709 --> 00:15:02,889
numbers tail yeah exactly that's what

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:05,889
the comes as a the price for me I

00:15:02,889 --> 00:15:10,550
expected the negative Sonia I filled it

00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:12,769
but my results say that the contrary is

00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:15,259
too and that means the more deadlines

00:15:12,769 --> 00:15:18,620
you have in a commercial project if more

00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:21,589
from the program at 6p energy pulses and

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:25,870
that's very interesting because that

00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:25,870
means that deadlines are no fun killer

00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,129
yeah

00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,500
no feeling deadlines are great if your

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:52,920
project is lousy it's really nice to

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:56,160
know what happened yeah maybe I da and

00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,690
we can speculate Papa about this result

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:04,070
well actually the deadline is very

00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:06,810
pointed with the challenge level yeah I

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:12,860
would agree with us at lines be

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:12,860
directing to game theory I've towards

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,210
yeah that was also one result I

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:27,420
remembered from the talk yesterday they

00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:31,460
had tough deadlines but they enjoyed

00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:34,430
never less the project and had fun

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:37,230
though data enter an oven killer and

00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:39,360
good bro check visions can be worked out

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,490
on the commercial conditions to I I

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,510
think the same holds for optimal

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:48,300
challenge if an employer knows both the

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:51,240
project and the abilities of view of the

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:54,690
employees they can provide optimal

00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:58,980
challenges but they have to do it it

00:16:54,690 --> 00:17:02,100
doesn't come for free thus I proved that

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,250
having fun while programming is not an

00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:08,940
experience that holds only for open

00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:14,760
source developers and that is not an

00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:16,980
experience we have only during our spare

00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,410
time but it's true for software

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:24,030
development in general programming can

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:26,820
and should make fun irrespective on the

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,040
what irrespective of this activity

00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,650
standing out in open source context or

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:34,520
under professional conditions and in a

00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,080
commercial project if you in a real-life

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,060
project in real life as Pro finish

00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:42,300
professional software developer

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,040
experience less or no fun this has

00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,830
something wrong with the employer I

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,500
think it doesn't have an excuse at least

00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:57,480
not on theoretical grounds

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:59,130
it's just not good enough though the

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,410
experience of fun while programming is

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,680
an experience that can be generalized

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:07,890
for the activity programming we can

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,950
conclude thus professional software

00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:13,110
developers have double rewards the work

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:16,290
of such is rewarding because we enjoy

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:20,280
one plus the work is paid which is the

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:22,350
pleasant experience to that leads to the

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,450
following question our software

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:28,110
developers privileged because they

00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:30,870
rewarded twice or are the other work

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,900
areas where people are rewarded both

00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:37,410
monetary and intrinsically because they

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,100
enjoy the work they do if the latter is

00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:42,960
true this raises an interesting question

00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:45,900
what starts it implies work is rewarding

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:49,470
place in general for a variety of work

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:54,750
areas let's focus on this question for a

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:57,150
while and we look at how work is

00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,570
perceived we can recognize two distinct

00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:03,960
and contradicting concepts the first is

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:07,710
work is compulsion you must be set free

00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,650
from work which is the compensation for

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:14,370
suffering we experience at work the

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:17,520
second concept which I like to promote

00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:21,210
this work is evolving because work is

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,940
making fun when we look at the political

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,980
discussions in modern societies the

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,920
first interpolation interpretation is

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,560
the dominant concept there are parties

00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:34,230
in all modern societies and strong trade

00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:37,280
unions that too hard work to set us free

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:40,320
from work concerning the other attitude

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,210
there's no party I know of that is

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,260
committed to improve the quality of work

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,940
we do during the last 100 years it was

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:50,280
the main goal of leftist parties the

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,680
support improvement of the working

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:55,320
condition of the workers in the industry

00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,020
and the employees in general they have

00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,770
been very successful but you know that

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,240
time the focus of this approach if that

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,460
is shift can be shown when will

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,820
look at the mutation of the idea of the

00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:11,760
provisions for the old age one of the

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,679
biggest success of the leftist parties

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,770
was the introduction of a system of

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:35,540
provisions for the old age of old age

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:38,010
pension schemes but yeah you're correct

00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:43,820
collectors historically thank you for

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,820
the input the original ad behind such

00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:49,710
themes was to provide an income for the

00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:52,679
old in the times when they are not more

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:56,760
employable monday too weak to work and

00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:01,890
this basic idea is an idea of insurance

00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,780
and this of course makes sense but in

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:06,090
the meantime the insurance ID was

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,030
abolished and we have a pure pension

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:11,130
scheme you go into pension because

00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:14,429
you're old enough not because you're not

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:17,280
more able to work Dutch assistant makes

00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:20,330
perfect sense if you hate the work you

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,300
do but how is it when you love the work

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,770
but does he tell about a society if one

00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,720
of the most important fights of

00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,570
important players in the political arena

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,929
is to set you free from work as soon as

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:37,140
possible of course such an understanding

00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:40,559
of the work has had its reasons at the

00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:43,290
industrial times of the modern societies

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,860
around one century ago the work in the

00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:48,420
factories was between hardened horrible

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,809
working in the factories meant being

00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:53,610
exploited for most of the time the

00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:56,580
commitment of the labor unions and the

00:21:53,610 --> 00:22:00,330
leftist parties and of Bismarck for the

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,960
workers was important and beneficial but

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:05,460
those times changed if you look at the

00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,890
sectoral distribution of the gross

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,010
national product we see that the

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:14,309
industrial sector only contributes a

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,320
quarter the most important sector both

00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:17,180
if we look at the contribution of the

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,450
Gulf National

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:24,560
product and the number of persons

00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:26,570
working in is the service sector is

00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,060
shift of importance concerning the

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,790
sector's was accompanied by a shift of

00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:36,920
importance of education education became

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:39,080
more and more important the importance

00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,050
of both the third sector and education

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,940
has gone up in industrial times the

00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:46,220
manual workers was the prototypical

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,070
person in society in the modern

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:53,330
societies is the knowledge worker that

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,890
has taken his place I've copied the

00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,500
Wikipedia definition of the term

00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,260
knowledge economy according to this

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,080
definition knowledge economy is a

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,350
concept that supports the creation of

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:08,840
knowledge by the employees in a company

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:11,120
the aspect that knowledge created by the

00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:12,830
employees has to be in line with the

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:18,800
company's goals is very important I

00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:21,050
think let's approach the fact that the

00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:24,350
belief in the knowledge society and that

00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:26,750
we work in a knowledge economy by

00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:29,620
putting us into the view of an employer

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:33,050
what does this fact mean for an employer

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,850
yes assume a rational employer that

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:38,420
means at the end of the day he wants to

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:41,480
have a profit in a correctly

00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,430
institutional economy he does this by

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:47,210
selling products or services to

00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:52,910
customers cuz he can't do this all alone

00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:54,790
he needs employees as soon as he has

00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,690
employees he runs into a problem

00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:00,110
economical scientists called a

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:02,390
principal-agent problem the owner that

00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:05,360
is the principal and his employees the

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,460
agents have different goals the company

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,530
is successful only if it manages to

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,470
bring the employees goals in line with

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,120
the company's goals basically the

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:17,810
employee can exert two different

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:21,710
concepts to achieve these control or

00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:24,290
loyalty this is too for all societies

00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,420
with division of labor I think during

00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,940
the high times of industrialization and

00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:30,350
most of the employees worked in

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,650
factories

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:36,620
and at assembly lines control was the

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:38,840
obvious choice Atia assembly line you're

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,200
almost automatically in line with the

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:47,780
company's goals but we are the assembly

00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:50,120
lines in the knowledge economy in the

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:52,070
knowledge economy the determining factor

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,270
is not what the employee achieves

00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:58,100
compared to predefined goals and plans

00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,990
the knowledge economy dia Hardy plants

00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:03,919
whose fulfillment can be measured by

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:06,350
quantitative means predefined work can

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,890
be handled by machine spare about the

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,210
much better suited to do such work

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,179
because they're much more efficient to

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,580
do such work and it comes to human work

00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:20,000
it's much vitamin we let humans working

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,640
on flexible in an uncontrolled context

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,789
with the fulfillment of the task depends

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,409
upon the employees creativity and

00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:32,960
ingenuity employees ability to act and

00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:35,870
react in unplanned and unfamiliar

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,140
familiar situation is a central success

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:42,740
factors especially if the company act in

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:45,500
highly competitive areas these are the

00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:47,690
employees which contribute to the

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:51,919
company's advance and make it

00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:54,200
distinguishable from the competitors it

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,780
was Peter Drucker who first introduced

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,880
the term knowledge economy The Wall

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,940
Street Journal labeled him as the Dean

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,580
of the US business and management

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:07,309
philosophers if you look through the

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:10,280
management literature he wrote you won't

00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:14,750
find anything about how to control the

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:17,059
employees instead you find lots of story

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:22,000
insights about how to motivate the

00:26:17,059 --> 00:26:25,220
employees how to leverage the potential

00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,679
the quotes I've taken from him the two

00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,770
quotes proof that he was perfectly aware

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:34,640
of the importance of challenge and fun

00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:39,590
to motivate the employees the quote the

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,419
first quote to make

00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:46,760
hide amounts based on the person's

00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:53,710
things that's nothing other than who

00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:57,110
provide challenge and the second quote

00:26:53,710 --> 00:27:03,590
about fun and its effects on the climate

00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:06,200
within the company vaca didn't work for

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:09,860
companies whose employees didn't enjoy

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:11,840
the work he didn't this because he

00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:16,390
simply couldn't get somewhere with such

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:20,350
companies there's another fine quote I

00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:22,730
drop it is it from another psychologist

00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,159
with pillow into the management

00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:28,640
literature it's from Csikszentmihalyi

00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:30,890
which invented the flow concept is who

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,340
discovered he discovered the blog flow

00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:40,880
phenomenon and of course you are he was

00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:42,890
aware of the fun and happiness it was

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,809
aware that fun and happiness is not only

00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:48,110
a matter of scientific research but of

00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:50,720
economic and social practice to but

00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:54,730
unfortunately these findings didn't make

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,730
it really into the managers head I think

00:27:54,940 --> 00:28:05,690
but at least what the yearly Gallup

00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:10,130
studies show us below the Gallup

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:13,100
Institute makes since 10 years an

00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:18,080
engagement index and the last year's

00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:21,260
results about Germany yielded the

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,029
following data only thirteen percent of

00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:28,149
the employees have high emotional

00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:30,860
binding to the company went one percent

00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:33,559
percent of the employees have no

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,559
bindings at all they behaved destructive

00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:39,250
at the workplace they show no personal

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,020
engagement instead they do work to do

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:43,730
the absent time of such employees is

00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,679
twenty-eight percent higher than those

00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,590
of their colleagues they don't

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,570
contribute any ideas to the company and

00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,160
fifty-nine percent of them plan to leave

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:56,680
the company within a year

00:28:53,160 --> 00:29:01,360
most the most frequent substantiation of

00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:03,430
such behavior is according develop the

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,740
missing attention of and recognition of

00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:08,680
the superiors the employees don't find

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,170
themselves sufficiently promoted and and

00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:14,410
the employees opinion is not appreciated

00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:18,630
and this is exactly the contrary of what

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:21,040
dark current Csikszentmihalyi promoted

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:25,060
poorly motivated employees cause

00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:27,490
significant hosts for Germany the Gallup

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:35,440
Institute instituted estimate the cost

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:37,920
of 126 billion euro per year let's dig

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,750
deep into the concept of loyalty to

00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,480
fully understand the meaning of the term

00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,930
loyalty it's worth to look at the

00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,450
alternate alternatives in 1970 The

00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,970
Economist autopathy Earthman came up

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:55,030
with a very influential concept that

00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:57,790
they explained that he explained using

00:29:55,030 --> 00:30:00,880
the three terms exit worries and loyalty

00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,190
these three terms described on the most

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,270
generic level the basic interactions of

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:09,430
an individual visibly the organization

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,850
organizational company is in if the

00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:14,620
organization is a company the

00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:17,830
individuals may be customers or

00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:21,180
employees in the political Eric area the

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:24,610
individuals are citizens or inhabitants

00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:27,160
the terms describe different interaction

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,980
channels that transmit information of

00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:33,400
possibly different kind and of different

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:36,930
strengths an organization that has to

00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:40,710
orient on the needs of the individuals

00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:43,750
or examples under needs of customers

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:46,360
will seek for the signals sent through

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:50,020
these channels the more dynamic and

00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:52,270
organization is the better it is in

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:56,530
deciphering these signals and the sooner

00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:59,290
it is able to adapt exit is the channel

00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,630
so reach the weaker signals are sent but

00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:04,250
at the same time Exodus an effort

00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:07,580
causing the biggest car costs

00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:09,650
if a company loses customers the company

00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:15,530
has to find new customers and this is

00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:18,200
closely in an undemocratic state if this

00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:20,570
state loses citizens it has to pull up

00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,710
walls on the borders and these causes

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:28,070
heavy costs on larry's levels tired of

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:32,990
the obvious yet the physical exit is the

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:35,060
exit in the inner immigration employees

00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,940
with no image emotional binding on the

00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:41,180
company will either leave the company or

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:45,470
do work to rule and will be absent

00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:47,720
whenever possible an organization that

00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:50,180
is aware of the exit option will try to

00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,480
make the voice option as easy and

00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:56,780
attractive as possible if an unsatisfied

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,360
customer complains in instead of exiting

00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,480
silently it provides valuable

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,700
information to the company an attentive

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,730
company will adapt as soon as possible

00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:10,460
and starts preventing design loss of

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:15,400
many other customers and the same holds

00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:18,770
for critical employee to they provide

00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:22,340
very valuable information to the company

00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:24,500
to their intent if company the loyal

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,500
individual is providing the most value

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:29,180
for the organization using in line with

00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,200
the goals of the organization without

00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:35,840
control the employee the employer can't

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,610
command loyalty and he can't buy loyalty

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,980
only by giving the salary salary so

00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:46,520
important salary is related to the

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:50,240
contractual level workforce is exchanged

00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:54,020
for salary you work and you get paid but

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:57,020
when it comes to loyalty it's it's more

00:32:54,020 --> 00:33:00,530
than contractual it's a different level

00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:03,170
it's an exchange to the employee gives

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:06,620
his loyalty if temple if the employer

00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:09,560
gives him the possibility to evolve is

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,180
potential in return but that's the

00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,700
employer can evolve the employees

00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:16,640
potential he has to be aware of this

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:17,210
potential he has to offer the challenges

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,090
and

00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:22,970
he has to offer direction and this is

00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:26,240
exactly the conditions that make that

00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:29,750
the employee enjoys the work he does at

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,039
least according dull my study of about

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,909
the motivations of open-source

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:37,039
programmers and at the same time these

00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:40,520
are the means to bring the employee in

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,409
line with the organizational skills of

00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,809
course all these considerations make

00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:47,059
sense only for the individuals and

00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:53,960
organizations in a knowledge economy and

00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:56,980
then knowledge society but I finished my

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,330
reflections and I can recapitulate

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,760
because of the division of labor and

00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:04,279
because of the knowledge economy the

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,940
employer has to bring the employees in

00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:10,460
line with the organizational goals the

00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:13,220
employee can either control or he can

00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:15,830
trust on the employees loyalty when you

00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:18,320
control you get what you see but that's

00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:20,839
probably not what you want in particular

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:25,820
you don't get anything surprising or

00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:29,030
innovative but in the knowledge economy

00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:31,490
companies have to be innovative there

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:35,300
for companies to better if they seek the

00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:36,470
employers for the employees loyalty the

00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,659
employees are willing to give their

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:42,589
loyalty in exchange for the employer's

00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,230
willingness to evolve the potential an

00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:48,800
employee can evolve the potential to the

00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:51,560
employees % if he's aware of these

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,589
things of the employees if he esteems

00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:57,890
the work the employee stars if he

00:34:54,589 --> 00:35:00,230
provides a vision of the company the

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:03,050
employee works in and he provides

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:06,109
challenging objectives the employees has

00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,940
to achieve under such conditions the

00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:11,270
employee is both in line with the

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:14,060
company's goals and he had fun doing the

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:16,910
work he does with his work he creates

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:21,380
valuable Goods and thus it provides to

00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:23,390
the employers profit thus I proved that

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:26,170
one is by no means a privilege of

00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:28,790
open-source programmers nor of software

00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,650
developers in general but it's a common

00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:32,809
feature of work

00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:39,529
in the knowledge economy and knowledge

00:35:32,809 --> 00:35:41,900
society now what are the political

00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:45,609
implications of that fact of the fact

00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:49,190
that work can and should be fun for all

00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:52,130
one is obvious the leftist battle cry

00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:55,039
let's get rid of work has become kind of

00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:58,160
obsolete what really matters now is to

00:35:55,039 --> 00:36:00,559
get freedom at work we should ask for

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,150
political organizations like that commit

00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:07,940
to the quality of work if we care for

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,099
the quality of work on the same time we

00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:12,920
have to insist on the value that is

00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:15,319
created to work we have to insist you

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,619
have to appreciate that the value that

00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:21,980
is created through work consumption that

00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:24,500
is ok but creation is better if we scorn

00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:29,990
the values created by work the otakon

00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:32,859
can't appreciate work as such some

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:35,710
people claim that because of Technology

00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:38,809
technological advances work will run out

00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:42,410
so why bother about the quality of work

00:36:38,809 --> 00:36:46,160
if there is knowledge work left over but

00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:48,890
I don't agree with such IDs you don't

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,740
have to worry that work could run out

00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:57,170
the service sectors potential to create

00:36:51,740 --> 00:37:00,020
work is unlimited I think many companies

00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:02,270
still didn't get the lesson and they

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:05,869
provide who work and poor workplaces for

00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:09,049
their employees at least that's what the

00:37:05,869 --> 00:37:11,660
illegal up studies show so what can we

00:37:09,049 --> 00:37:16,039
do to achieve an economy that provides

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:18,559
work for all that is fun to do I am

00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:21,349
convinced that bad companies cannot

00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:24,440
survive in the long because ostraka

00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:28,910
pointed it out bad companies produce

00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:31,279
mean quality here for stiff competition

00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:33,200
in the market is good because it drives

00:37:31,279 --> 00:37:36,400
the bad companies out of the market as

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,529
soon as possible so that can take that

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,680
such companies can be replaced by better

00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:44,259
ones by companies that provide good

00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,900
working places

00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:49,579
however there's an important social

00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:51,499
prerequisite you have to make all

00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:55,339
individuals feet for the knowledge

00:37:51,499 --> 00:38:01,609
economy education is the key factor to

00:37:55,339 --> 00:38:03,799
achieve this I am convinced that having

00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:06,890
fun while working is not only good for

00:38:03,799 --> 00:38:10,400
the individual and it's by no means and

00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:13,099
ended it you need an end in itself in

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,369
contrary it's good for the society as a

00:38:13,099 --> 00:38:19,939
whole because if a society succeeds to

00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:22,849
make work enjoyable for all such a

00:38:19,939 --> 00:38:25,309
society will be more dynamic and capable

00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:31,209
of solving the upcoming social problems

00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:31,209
and there are plenty of them at any time

00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:36,890
though I hope you agree with my with me

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,549
and share this view and I thank you for

00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:39,549
attending

00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:56,550
just out of interest did you ask about

00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,010
the the operating system the software

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,290
developers we are working on whether

00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:03,660
with those companies doing commercial

00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:11,460
development and did they have also such

00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:15,720
much fun no I don't have that are

00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:19,080
correlated with our operating system so

00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,940
i can't say something about this so your

00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,010
analysis is based on comparing open

00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,870
source software around the world to

00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,000
commercial software developed in

00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:28,680
switzerland you have several confounding

00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,050
factors there so for instance you have

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:33,030
open source software development like

00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:34,980
Python work we do is sponsored by Google

00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:37,080
to development which is an open source

00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,820
software at a company as a bit of

00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:40,290
commercial proprietary another companion

00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:42,630
factor of course is that you have

00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:43,980
Switzerland which of the open source

00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,510
pact which is correlation between the

00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:47,580
open source projects primarily developed

00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:48,960
in switzerland vs switzerland and third

00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,910
confounding factor you have you click on

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,610
deadlines is that a number of projects

00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:55,350
including python have deadlines multiply

00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,840
python has polish and deadlines lubuntu

00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:59,580
has regular cadences recycles so you

00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,170
could look at the correlation which is

00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,330
inside the open source projects without

00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,650
doing the analysis provides are without

00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,870
doing the confounding effects of

00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:08,310
commercial inside of Switzerland what is

00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:11,390
the results of that analysis and how

00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,390
does that affect your conclusions

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:45,430
yeah I have been able to do this those

00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:50,259
subsamples not only a I have to tell you

00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:53,619
so and I did not compare for these

00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:58,049
different concerning deadlines and

00:40:53,619 --> 00:41:02,819
having fun by comparing it is the

00:40:58,049 --> 00:41:05,220
responses i got that through the

00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:09,369
commercial companies in Switzerland

00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:12,400
luckily I have been able to do within

00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:19,119
the responses i scattered through the

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:21,519
open source questionnaire to vacated

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:27,369
those two subsamples and for that i

00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:30,900
could compare these examples and so

00:41:27,369 --> 00:41:33,960
therefore i was have been able to make

00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,470
these conclusions concerning deadlines

00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:43,230
so it's not a comparison between the

00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:43,230
responses gathered so the company a

00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:53,319
questionnaire but within the open

00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:57,549
translation air yeah I have one question

00:41:53,319 --> 00:42:00,849
about how societies could deal with

00:41:57,549 --> 00:42:02,980
those people who are biologically or by

00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:06,880
early social conditioning not able to

00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:09,579
take part in the knowledge economy was

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:15,970
simply not bright enough to take part in

00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:22,859
the knowledge economy yeah let's say of

00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:22,859
course that's a a problem such a

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:32,049
analysis doesn't fit for a one hundred

00:42:26,529 --> 00:42:34,750
percent and there but I think if a comp

00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:41,490
if a society is dynamic if it can

00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:41,490
produce welfare then we can also

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:54,470
be aware of those five ten percent that

00:42:48,400 --> 00:43:00,920
don't fit and if society is dynamic

00:42:54,470 --> 00:43:03,940
maybe we can provide tools to improve

00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,770
the situation also for for this

00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:12,520
leftovers what is 5 10 per cents I'm

00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:16,970
very optimistic about that at all

00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:25,100
service knowledge economy I mean they

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:36,200
take our part of the service hinges are

00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:40,670
don't have to be yeah the being bright

00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:44,240
and wanting to do the high-tech kind of

00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:48,130
knowledge economy stuff the service

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:51,140
industry includes other kinds of

00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:53,420
abilities and skills including people

00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:58,070
who are smart enough to figure out your

00:43:53,420 --> 00:44:00,230
car ah and people who are able to cook

00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:04,820
wonderful food and things like that are

00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:12,500
also service and also can have fun in

00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:15,710
their work so there's a recent buzzword

00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:18,740
trend of gamification work where you

00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:21,140
basically take a farmville like game of

00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:24,410
that's compulsive like checking email

00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,820
and internet and gold at elements of

00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:30,110
massive multiplayer role-playing

00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:33,860
strategy so at that point you basically

00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:38,090
can take on old-school company that's

00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:41,450
repetitive mind the dumping work make it

00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:45,530
a game it's not personally satisfying

00:44:41,450 --> 00:44:49,600
but it's like crack just you just keep

00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:53,030
clicking keep checking stuff so um so

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:55,700
you so this is basically industries

00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:56,450
response on your thoughts on that we

00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:00,109
need to

00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:01,810
have more engaged users arm and maybe

00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:07,640
you can comment further on this

00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:14,530
perspective and and you repeat the first

00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:18,380
part of you it indicated elite of the

00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:22,280
description so gamification right um no

00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:26,060
rolling it into games aha yeah game like

00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:29,000
interface but you said that it's not so

00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:34,820
funny not on Jo enjoyable I think game

00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:37,490
is way so um so um how many times did

00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,790
the check your email so if you're more

00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:42,560
like us you would check email every five

00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:48,800
minutes and then you check slashdot and

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:51,820
read it and so research on the way brain

00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:56,109
work is that every time there's a new

00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:58,880
story on slashdot you get like a small

00:45:56,109 --> 00:46:03,589
chemical reaction which is essentially

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:07,369
the same as you know getting drugs so um

00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:10,160
but the trick is that even like gambling

00:46:07,369 --> 00:46:13,910
when you roll the dice it's the

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:18,619
happiness of getting a chance of being

00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:20,630
like of being successful and if you turn

00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:22,280
that into farmville game and everything

00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:24,950
that's popular in facebook today or even

00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,339
in a world of warcraft you can explore

00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:30,230
the same mechanics and get like you know

00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:32,150
tower defense games and anything just

00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:36,079
things that you click for hours and if

00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:38,270
you lousy but you still click and so

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,150
there's like a whole body of knowledge

00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:44,480
that bear basically take a security

00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:47,180
guard and you have them you know you

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,880
using computer graphics insert bad guys

00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:52,940
into their screens to keep them alert

00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:54,500
and to give them something to work so

00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:57,560
they essentially play World of Warcraft

00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,599
whole day watching the monitors where

00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:03,260
otherwise they would be falling asleep

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:04,849
on and that way you get um yeah you get

00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,099
better performance you can give them

00:47:04,849 --> 00:47:10,360
visual gold you can give them guilds

00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:12,670
they compete to other a security guy

00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:14,200
I'm not saying it's right but it's

00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:19,150
something that industry is moving

00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:21,490
towards yeah it's an interesting all

00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:25,020
right yeah it doesn't give happiness so

00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:29,800
it's not exactly fun and I also have

00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:32,850
what 2 comments one is that sort of

00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:35,890
assumed there's a feet between my

00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:39,550
interests and talents and market which i

00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:42,460
think is not necessary widely true and

00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:48,100
the other comment would be that I

00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:50,620
somehow doubt that move of manufacturing

00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:54,180
to China has to do something with China

00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:57,970
workers being happier at what they do so

00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:02,190
just assuming that competition would

00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:11,350
lead to a happier workforce is kind of

00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:19,000
anxious yeah that's a good point but I

00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:25,210
think it's a stepwise approach I think

00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:29,430
it in the markets of the developed

00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:32,280
countries they are outsourcing the

00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:36,460
assembly lines to China and then to

00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:40,240
Vietnam and poor countries / but on the

00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:45,910
same times they create wealth in these

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:51,490
countries and it's the hope that if this

00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:56,290
mobile they can i undid the end they

00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:58,720
have to provide the work for for these

00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:02,230
peoples to that make fun date is

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:05,020
enjoyable but for the moment of course

00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:09,610
that that's right the poor work is

00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:13,240
outsourced to such countries I will

00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,620
about the challenging part to make it

00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,200
something challenging it means

00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:20,560
intrinsically that I will eventually

00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,320
fail if it's I'm not going to fail

00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:26,770
sometimes not a real challenge

00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:31,570
me and you can see it out all the scale

00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:33,400
in the sense that you can fail in making

00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:36,400
the software right first time and then

00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,640
you can fix the back and this is very

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:44,620
particular of the software environment

00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:50,320
you cannot fix after driving the bus you

00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:55,540
try to turn better this time challenging

00:49:50,320 --> 00:50:00,610
your left go it's not exactly applicable

00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:04,210
in this type of phil's sense making it

00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:09,510
people fun using challenging is a

00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:09,510
playable only when failure it's okay

00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:17,740
yeah that's of course that's true but i

00:50:13,270 --> 00:50:22,360
think this interpretation holds not only

00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:28,600
for the software industry but for a

00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:37,710
various other aspect of the service

00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:37,710
sector but of course a in a the the

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:50,530
gesundheit text or determine per sector

00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:54,670
yeah if the the message has to operate

00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:58,030
on a human body they do this no such

00:50:54,670 --> 00:51:03,370
thing as a bailar app to fail

00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:08,140
possibility back after you cannot wake

00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:10,360
up one night Oh what was the problem

00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,410
it's just I wanted to ask a different

00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:13,690
question but it's interesting you're

00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:15,040
talking about bus driving the people i

00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:16,540
think in stockholm I'm not sure which

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,460
city in Sweden not the one that i live

00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:22,110
in thought the bus drivers were not

00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:24,340
driving properly so they installed

00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:26,770
things that looked like paintbrushes on

00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:29,140
the outside of the buses so and then

00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:30,880
they had other sensors on the street

00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,410
corners so they could measure how close

00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:36,770
to the corners they were doing to see

00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:37,880
whether they were the problem there

00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,470
complaining people were complaining

00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,180
about which the bus was too far away

00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:42,950
from the curb so the old people at art

00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,840
I'm getting on the bus and then they

00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:46,520
could measure it and they could fail and

00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:52,700
it was safe so you can even do it for

00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:54,830
buses well the question bus rodeos they

00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:58,670
have bus driver rodeos where they do

00:51:54,830 --> 00:52:02,020
this thing cool I have no idea anyway

00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:04,400
but the question is is this is this all

00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:07,550
self-selected sets really all volunteers

00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:09,830
who chose to talk to you or when you

00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:16,220
went to the company's how did you get

00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:19,280
your data where's it all did the people

00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,560
who talk to you select themselves to you

00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:24,110
to talk to you or did you sort of go out

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:28,010
and randomly sample people and say you

00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:29,540
must give me the answers no problem on

00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:32,420
you when you're doing a survey about

00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:34,100
anything and you get the self selected

00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:35,450
set because the people who want to talk

00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,730
to you generally are the people who

00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,050
really love with love what they're doing

00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,490
and they want to talk to you about it

00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:41,690
because they think it's great well the

00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:43,850
people who are really really unhappy

00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,130
about it and and they want to to

00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:48,620
you about how rotten everything is but

00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:50,750
the people in between I'm too busy I'm

00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:53,660
not going to do any of this so I'm

00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:55,640
wondering know how widely can you

00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:58,670
generalize this if it's just the self

00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:02,020
selected set I mean know your truth

00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:05,870
that's a flow of my study it was a

00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:08,450
purely self selected sample online

00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:16,730
Krishna in both samples commercial the

00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:22,430
opposite exactly yeah a basic stuff

00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:26,270
anywhere like frequency synchro yeah on

00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:29,750
my table yeah my data if you're

00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:31,350
interested I could give you this the

00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:37,930
data

00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:41,050
it's fun wanted to very specifically

00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:43,930
challenge the software versus health

00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:47,890
industry distinction about which jobs

00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:51,760
can be challenging there are jobs in for

00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:54,220
example oncology you can play safe and

00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,550
you're patient with advanced metastatic

00:53:54,220 --> 00:54:00,310
cancer will be ninety nine point ninety

00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:03,790
seven percent certain to die according

00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:07,690
to proper accepted procedure or you can

00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:11,830
take risk actually you can't decide to

00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:15,190
but the patients who are nearly certain

00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:17,950
to die will desperately cue to sign up

00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:20,410
to experimental things where they're 99

00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:22,960
certain to die ninety-nine percent which

00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:25,420
is much better than by no running risk

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,850
on the other hand when you write the

00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:31,860
software that controls the amount of

00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:35,620
radiation that is coming out of that

00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:38,500
radiotherapy machine that the oncologist

00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:41,560
may be using in a certain context your

00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:43,540
mistake is just as bad as a mistake of

00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:46,230
the oncologist there isn't a sharp line

00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:50,290
there are a few spots in health care

00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:52,570
where risk is a master in a few spots in

00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:55,930
software where risk is absolutely out of

00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:59,110
the question so I don't think there's

00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:01,360
such sharp lines bus bus driving is an

00:54:59,110 --> 00:55:04,320
example where I cannot actually think of

00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:07,150
a situation where risk is better but

00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:09,640
actually driving anything occasionally

00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:12,700
you find yourself in situations were

00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:16,450
like a invisible patch of black ice on

00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:20,500
the street hits you playing it saves

00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:22,120
means crashing for certain and so the

00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,460
risk may be acceptable but it's not

00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,970
something you plan in advance who let's

00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:29,770
put some patches of black ice just to

00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:33,040
make things challenging so it's very

00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:36,340
different situation on say

00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,380
business I want to thank you for making

00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:41,080
such a good case for companies adopting

00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:43,750
a natural mindset but I also want to

00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:46,930
point out that she sent me highly in his

00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:49,510
research says that people are often

00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:52,330
totally unaware that they are in a state

00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:54,760
of flow so he has a very special study

00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:58,000
design that accommodates for that and he

00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:00,580
also finds that the state of flow is not

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,760
something that is hard to reach in work

00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:07,350
and that there is that is not flow is

00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,310
not dependent on education at all yeah

00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:16,470
why do you come to these conclusions

00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:24,700
that education is key I approach both

00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:31,570
that your question was a right to

00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:35,320
combine flow state with education and my

00:56:31,570 --> 00:56:39,010
approach was a education is important in

00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:42,640
the knowledge society and the knowledge

00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:47,800
society is the society most of us are

00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:54,000
sleeping compared to the situation 100

00:56:47,800 --> 00:57:00,870
years before and the important thing is

00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:05,110
the principal-agent problem the in a

00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:07,060
economy with division of labor is the

00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:09,370
employee and on the other side the

00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:13,690
employees and the employee has to bring

00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:20,020
the employees in line with their with

00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:23,020
the company's goals and 100 years ago he

00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:26,830
could achieve this using the assembly

00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:31,960
line using the control and in the

00:57:26,830 --> 00:57:36,580
knowledge economy I think I'm confident

00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:40,810
that this is not more true instead yes

00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:43,710
to bring the employees in line through

00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:43,710
loyalty and

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:54,660
where does education come into this and

00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:57,210
the loyalty it's an exchange the

00:57:54,660 --> 00:58:01,319
employer the employees are willing to

00:57:57,210 --> 00:58:05,940
give loyalty if they get some kind of

00:58:01,319 --> 00:58:08,160
fun in return and asked what you want to

00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:15,510
give you employees for example rather

00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:18,809
than asian isn't it rather stuff like

00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:20,789
trust you give your employees that gets

00:58:18,809 --> 00:58:25,380
them motivated rather than stuff of

00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:27,450
stuff like education the education comes

00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:30,390
in because of the of the knowledge

00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:33,000
economy your only contribute you're only

00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:37,490
in the knowledge economy because you'll

00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,470
educate that you own it yeah some kind

00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:42,420
more more education too therefore that

00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:43,740
you can contribute and these

00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,049
contributions are needed because

00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:51,119
knowledge the players in the knowledge

00:58:46,049 --> 00:59:00,150
economy needs innovation I level healing

00:58:51,119 --> 00:59:02,789
spells to get you the phone right so

00:59:00,150 --> 00:59:04,920
based on your conclusions arm there

00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:07,579
could be a possible follow-up research

00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,869
where you take a look at the open source

00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:14,549
projects and see how they structure

00:59:09,869 --> 00:59:18,660
their tasks if there are so what how

00:59:14,549 --> 00:59:20,849
clearly the they have goals and

00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:24,170
deadlines and release cycles and goes

00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:27,359
for those recycle how they structure

00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:30,170
single tasks so to give easier access

00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:33,270
and then compare that to the number of

00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:36,450
commits or contributions messages too

00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:40,020
many lists average time to answer the

00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:42,240
ticket and run that across I don't know

00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:44,789
let's say popular Python web frameworks

00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,869
and see how because you know have nice

00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:50,520
five years of data and you could get

00:59:47,869 --> 00:59:52,920
revolution good meta-analysis on top of

00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,460
that yeah that would be of course would

00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:58,020
be very very interesting but i'm not

00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,990
working at a research in situ

00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:03,480
instead i'm working at the services

01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:06,930
department and software port developed

01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:10,410
but i like this work and unfortunately i

01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:15,390
am not at the moment in a position to

01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:18,750
research but if some institutions or

01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:24,180
somebody here is in a position to do

01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:27,660
such work i can contribute my experience

01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:32,220
and my data set and of course i would

01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:38,490
love to see such results of a an

01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:40,280
additional follow-up study leave early

01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:43,350
on in the presentation you should have

01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:46,770
discussed the fact that a traditional

01:00:43,350 --> 01:00:48,150
left-wing platform was that abolishing

01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:51,510
work and you said we're making the case

01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:53,400
for making work more fun but i think i'm

01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:55,200
not a marxist by any stretch but i've

01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,360
read capital and one of the points that

01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:58,860
marks makes is that one of his criticism

01:00:57,360 --> 01:01:02,130
of capitalism is that workers are

01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:04,140
alienated from work and I think a lot of

01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:06,540
your analysis fits into that which is

01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,700
you know in some sectors I think you can

01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:10,860
make the case that workers have fun and

01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:12,600
can and have a stake in what they do and

01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:17,610
I think your analysis is very on point

01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:19,200
to that but in other sectors which are

01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:21,210
not in the knowledge economy in which

01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:24,590
it's hard to imagine making them fun I

01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:27,750
mean a lot of the things that we use as

01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:29,970
technology users iPads were made in a

01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:31,740
factory in China that had a suicide rate

01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:33,570
that was ridiculously high because

01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:35,610
workers were being made to work 24 hours

01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:37,590
a day so I don't think the work is there

01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:39,450
having fun it's there working there

01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:41,220
because it's cheap and the Chinese

01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:43,740
government doesn't crack down on certain

01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:46,320
working practices so how do you see that

01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:48,030
extending I'm so that all work becomes

01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,770
fun and not just you know for us

01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:52,320
privileged programmers that get to do

01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:56,670
really interesting stuff yeah that's a

01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:59,820
good point I think maybe that's our

01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:01,470
layer perspective but if you look at the

01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:05,010
historical data and if they're modern

01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:09,180
societies we see in all modern societies

01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:10,859
that the the third sector increased

01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:15,740
its contribution the gross national

01:02:10,859 --> 01:02:21,119
product that more and more people are

01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:26,099
employed in the third sector and I think

01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:36,359
and that they are various signs that the

01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:39,510
same steps are in perspective is hold on

01:02:36,359 --> 01:02:44,280
before also so forth for a vagina for

01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:51,200
the developing countries but of course

01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:56,099
as a distribution but but my hope that

01:02:51,200 --> 01:03:00,150
those a economies will evolve in an

01:02:56,099 --> 01:03:03,660
analogous way as we have seen in the in

01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:09,329
the Easter Seals industrialized in the

01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:14,250
developed countries maybe this evolution

01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:17,910
will be far faster than for our see in

01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:21,740
the last centuries and the this is of

01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:27,450
course that the hope that this evolution

01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:32,640
we will proceed faster in in in in the

01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:35,790
nowadays evolving countries and yeah at

01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:39,680
the moment we have a separation between

01:03:35,790 --> 01:03:44,510
the wealthy countries developing will

01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:51,000
welfare economies on the one side and

01:03:44,510 --> 01:03:57,750
many countries many economists with the

01:03:51,000 --> 01:04:03,210
classical lanes are still autopia what

01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:05,490
the vote is changing um yeah it's time

01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:08,820
for food I'm sorry to interrupt but the

01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:10,880
talk time is over we should find banner

01:04:08,820 --> 01:04:10,880
