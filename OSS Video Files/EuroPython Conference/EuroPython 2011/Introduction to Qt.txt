all right thank you everybody

00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:20,530
so first who I am okay so I'm working at

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:23,740
Nokia at the meego computers since 2008

00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,560
and I've been there I'm the Python guy

00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:28,270
there so I've been leading the PI side

00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,469
community projects and and the Hartman's

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:34,629
and Python projects and also I am doing

00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:37,030
hands-on stuff with with Python and our

00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:39,640
Python environment by by maintaining the

00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:42,249
internal Harmattan Python distribution

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,440
so because python is is used a lot

00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:48,579
internally for for all kind of systems

00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,499
testing purposes and and so on so so

00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:53,289
they need to have a stable stable and

00:00:50,499 --> 00:00:55,899
working environment there so I've been

00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:57,819
doing lots of especially lots of Debian

00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,280
packaging and integration and and all

00:00:57,819 --> 00:01:03,460
kinds of that's with with the Python

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:07,180
packages there I used to have a previous

00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:10,540
life as a speech scientists I did a PhD

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:13,300
in speech processing and in voice

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:15,670
quality analysis before before joining

00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,770
Nokia and making like change of courier

00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,210
to work with to be able to work with

00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:26,560
Python there I also in my in my research

00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:28,960
I was utilizing Python a lot so I'm even

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,110
though I'm giving the cute talk here I'm

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,180
actually not part of the I'm not a troll

00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:36,340
I'm a part of the cute organization bit

00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,020
but but but Mego but since they heard

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:43,900
that I would be coming here they asked

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:46,420
me to give this presentation here so

00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,610
this is going to be mostly a high-level

00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,400
overview about the cuticle system and

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,500
and and then how it relates to Python

00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:55,540
and so on so I'm sorry there's not going

00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:59,920
to be much of code here except a little

00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:01,840
in the end so I'm first going to ensure

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,840
that introduced kid what it what it's

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,940
all about and and so on and and bits

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,090
about like the mark marketing me stuff

00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,370
and and so on and then I will going to

00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,409
describe how to relates to because

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,560
because it's a C++ development framework

00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:18,650
so how does it relate

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,440
Python and why am i hearing you're in

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:25,720
Europe Python talking about kids and and

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,220
this describing the two most important

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,260
Python bindings projects PI cute and PI

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:35,750
side and finally I'm going to then have

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,790
a have a short short demo of how to get

00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,360
started with Pi site programming on the

00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:44,450
on the Nokia's in 950 developer device

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,660
like you some of you might have heard

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:51,110
about the Nokia n9 being announced on

00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,880
Tuesday so so there's also a respective

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,540
developer device already available to

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,700
select developers and and I would be

00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,860
showing with that how to how to start

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:09,620
programming Python with that for for

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:13,040
it's okay so cute was originally an

00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:17,030
independent company in in Norway called

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:22,160
trolltech and and got bought by Nokia in

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:25,880
2008 so to be the foundation of Nokia's

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,609
future user interfaces and there's more

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:32,030
than 250 employees working for cute and

00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:36,079
all over the world and and and and over

00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:42,130
5000 commercial users companies using

00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:46,040
using it and what is then so it's it's a

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:48,109
most many many people like having a long

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:51,950
background with quito rope or other

00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:54,410
open-source components regarded as a one

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,989
source one sort of a widget set so yeah

00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:00,410
it is that but it's also much more so

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:05,540
there's it's a complete UI development

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:07,970
framework with with IDE tools and and I

00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,900
know like like really rich class

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,269
hierarchies to develop on and so on and

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,859
it's it's usable for this for for

00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:19,010
desktop mobile and embedded development

00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:23,090
and is actively being used in in all

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:25,870
three categories and and there's a a

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,919
huge community behind it so there's

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,420
500,000 commercial open source

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,450
developers using using

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,280
it and and there's also a lot of

00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,280
professional services and support and

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:42,010
training and and and inactive open

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,010
source community behind behind it okay

00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:53,540
so where is it used then the traditional

00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,340
thing is that it was it was used as a

00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,860
desktop widget set but nowadays it's

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,960
it's like on the hardware platforms it's

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,080
it's used in various kinds of embedded

00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,440
devices which sets up boxes printers

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,190
I think elevator control panels mobile

00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:12,080
phones of course but in addition to that

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:15,380
so I can unless the pall so like on

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,920
various kinds of fields like like from

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:22,040
data imaging to to to Google Maps and or

00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:27,020
like Google Earth and and so on and and

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:29,360
lots of companies using it one showcase

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,280
for an application would be like

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,110
well-known application would be Google

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,520
Earth the user interface there is is

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:40,370
written written using kit and in the

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:43,520
open source world of course kaydee the

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,170
the whole KDE environment it's basically

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,920
built on built on kids so

00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:50,660
so there are cute widgets like all over

00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,740
the place and then kids and and and the

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:57,440
keys framework is it's very in very

00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,540
active use and they're all like just

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,790
just alone in indicate ecosystem their

00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,760
own or well more than four thousand

00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:11,060
applications so it's it's a big thing by

00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:14,540
itself so what what was the reason

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:18,890
behind behind cute why was it like

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:23,270
started so in like in late 80s and early

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:25,340
90s the the then available widgets or

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,350
like user interface toolkits we're

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:30,740
really primitive really awful to use

00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:35,390
this is the screenshot is above of the

00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:39,230
Athena widget sets and design made made

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,060
in MIT and and it was really ugly like

00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,240
the applications looked horrible and and

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,430
they were

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,100
like it they just required a lots of

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,050
code this was like the simple hello

00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,990
world application required more than 200

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:58,470
lines of code and and still looked like

00:06:51,990 --> 00:07:00,539
like it looked so it then started there

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:03,870
were two pretty young young guys they're

00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:06,930
like Harvard nor Dan Eric Eric sham bat

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:10,560
Ning and we're sitting in a park bench

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,630
in Trondheim Norway like apparently

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,370
being pretty first frustrated about the

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:19,289
about the motive and nothing a witnesses

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,090
and so and okay yeah we should have

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,160
something better and there's this this

00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,650
really new thing this object-orientation

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,050
like we've heard of it we've tried tried

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,610
it in the at the University so I think

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,530
we would need an object-oriented

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,830
presentation system that would be using

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,659
this these fancy new techniques and and

00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,750
there were then some some design

00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:41,159
guidelines and like our ideas so that's

00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,139
so that it's it's of course supposed to

00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:45,419
be easy to use though I for it for the

00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,620
programmer and it should be reliable and

00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,650
work well and it should be

00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:55,380
multi-platform like should be both on

00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:57,780
UNIX and and as well as Windows so and

00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,500
so it happened the first release took

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:06,719
took a few years so it was 0.9 which was

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:08,490
in 1995 and at that time okay it was not

00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,880
an open source license by the time and

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:14,099
it was released since that the web

00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,979
wasn't really prevalent at the time so

00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:20,900
it was released on an FTP server and and

00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:24,509
and and I was done on unused NIT news

00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:27,570
but but things moved forward and and in

00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:30,060
four years there was written to with

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:34,740
with an open source license although not

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,789
compatible with GPL and and lots of new

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:42,120
features like theming so and Unicode

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:44,820
support printing mouse wheel and a user

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,070
interface to all like yeah graphically

00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,570
graphical tool for designing the the

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,690
user interface interface is called

00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:57,350
called the designer and and things moved

00:08:51,690 --> 00:09:00,120
on from so to version 3 which had then

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,500
more than just the widget set like like

00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,880
all of them like the xml database

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,770
network input output and so on and and

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,110
lots of features in the in the basic

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:13,650
widget set itself and and also internal

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,350
internal internalization tools as well

00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,050
and and there the licensing was to

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,900
achieve a version 2 on on on the x11

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:25,140
platform only and commercial on on

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:29,670
Windows and yeah Mac support also came I

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:31,920
mean at that time a few years after was

00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:37,800
was for let's oh which was a major

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:41,550
really redesign of the framework it was

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:46,800
fully GPL or commercial licensed and and

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:48,720
had lots of like really a lot of new

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,660
features but but it was also a bit of a

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,480
pain big pain because it was not very

00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,510
backwards compatible so it's like it

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:03,240
took quite some time for for people to

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:05,190
adopt it so where we are now then it's

00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:09,420
already six years since for that so and

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:11,220
and and world has changed a lot and so

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,940
has cute

00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,540
first like when some of the most most

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:20,100
trivial more trivial but but still

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,480
significant things are is the WebKit

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,779
integration integration

00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:31,650
new versions of cute have a really

00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:34,190
modern key to WebKit to like HTML

00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:37,380
rendering supports and and it's actually

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,029
well it's actually been used in in for

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,810
example in the end more like mobile

00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:45,660
phone as is as they like as the HTML

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,130
components so so it's it's really good

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,149
it makes it makes it easy for

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:54,899
applications to embed embed web pages or

00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:57,480
HTML content and interact with them also

00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:01,230
the world has changed so that nowadays

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:04,350
things like like touch and and screen

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,110
rotation capabilities are are taking us

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:10,209
granted so that's the the toolkit should

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,730
should allow the users to or the

00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:15,339
developers to easily develop like

00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,920
applications which which adapt their

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:22,029
their layout for example when changing

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,610
the when rotating the screen or which

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:28,170
which are easy easy to use on fingers on

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:35,589
other like non desktop user interfaces

00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:38,620
and yeah so cute is very strongly moving

00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:40,750
towards this there's there's been around

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,720
for a couple of years this concept of

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,970
qml the cute markup language and and and

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,649
associated with key it quick the like

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:52,690
the framework offering offering UI

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:54,910
components and so on make it make it

00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,510
really possible make it possible and and

00:11:54,910 --> 00:12:00,570
and also really delightful to to do

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:05,140
these kinds of interfaces so I'll show a

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:08,740
little live demo of an early early demo

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:12,720
component demo program of of qml which

00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,720
is a simple flicker viewer

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:32,470
gallery like fashion and and it's it's

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:35,110
really fluid and okay and makes makes 4e

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:40,660
for easy interaction and this is this

00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:42,430
doesn't actually even use C++ at all but

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,500
this is old all done with the with the

00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:50,680
user interface definition language and

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:55,120
and in less than 1000 lines of code and

00:12:50,680 --> 00:13:00,779
allows this all kinds of dynamic dynamic

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,779
interactions all right

00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:08,519
so and and this also has a like a loud

00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:11,820
like okay these are screenshots from the

00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:14,850
from the Nokia n9 like and and it's

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:17,699
there they all of the user interfaces

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,959
have been have been done with with with

00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:24,389
kids or kit quick and and it's really

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,820
like it's probably better to have the

00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,290
demo like like offline after after this

00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,940
session but I can I can show them and

00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,740
show the interface to you and and it's

00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,010
really fluid and it's really easy to use

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,690
and it's like extremely finger friendly

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:43,920
and smooth so and and there's no no much

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:48,110
magic like behind it so like it's it's

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,110
very easy to do with with kids quickly

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:56,940
so in addition in additional in addition

00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,060
to the technological project progressed

00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,610
in queues it's nowadays it's also pretty

00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:05,880
much a requirement that's that projects

00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:09,000
are becoming not open not only in as an

00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:12,690
open source but but but also in the like

00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,000
manner of open governance so that we've

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,490
like before you it used to be very much

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,720
a like a company one single company

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:25,199
driven driven driven project but but it

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,060
is it is moving towards a open

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,110
governance model where where any

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:33,300
developer contributing too cute would be

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,040
treated equal and this was actually

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:38,339
something that was going to be launched

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,639
last week in the in the cute contributor

00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,920
summit in Berlin but but apparently they

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,010
ran out of time so I would expect this

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,069
to happen anytime soon and and it's

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,860
really going to be so that that there

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:57,329
are not going to be any any Nokia

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,920
internal discussions about about huge

00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,829
future directions or so but everything

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,540
will be in open and and any any any

00:15:01,829 --> 00:15:06,300
individual or company who wants to

00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,040
participate like can it's not going to

00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,269
be a democracy so it's still going to be

00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,760
like about about who are is what who is

00:15:12,269 --> 00:15:16,279
willing to put

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,949
and resources for developing itself so

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,050
make like get to get to have more say

00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:23,870
but but still anybody anyone can

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:28,970
contribute and anyone can be a become a

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:31,670
committee or maintainer or like have a

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:37,250
have a role in the in the in the cave

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:40,459
development organization ok I'm going to

00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:43,089
sidestep now a bit and and like this is

00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:46,839
a problem the most marketing marketing

00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:49,279
thing I'm going to explain here so the

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,470
the high tech high tech industry has

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,579
basically been moving in in these kind

00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,589
of cycles which are more like in which

00:15:55,579 --> 00:16:01,399
the the amount of devices has been

00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:05,329
growing like by by by every time by an

00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:10,459
order of magnitude and and around 2002

00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:12,920
or so like like there were was 1 billion

00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:16,779
1 billion units of cell phones or

00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:20,569
desktop internet and and now we are are

00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:23,240
gett getting move moving into into like

00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:27,310
and add another cycle where they are

00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:33,199
like a lot of these in like like mobile

00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:35,360
mobile devices are like embedded mobile

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,029
devices such as cell cell phones are

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,630
still like the obvious case but or music

00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:44,540
players but tablet like tablets tablets

00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:48,110
eBook readers but also this all kind of

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,440
smart TVs or smart media players or or

00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:54,459
entertainment systems which are more

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:58,160
more and more becoming connected and

00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:59,870
more significantly that like if you want

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,940
to develop for these like you are not

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,769
going to use the same paradigms as in

00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,510
for example in the desktop Internet so

00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:07,429
they are they user experience there is

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:11,329
it's very very much different than and

00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:16,339
and cute-cute is now something like it

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:18,410
is is approaching this this way with the

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:23,370
key it quick framework and so on so so

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:26,140
if you are using QT you should be saved

00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:28,950
to be developed to develop for the or

00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,270
set set to develop for the for the

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:37,120
so-called next ten billion devices as

00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:41,110
well and the kid developer summit last

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,450
week was sorry a kid contributor summit

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:46,510
last week was was mostly about about

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:50,790
roadmapping cute five and and it's going

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:53,350
to be a major major new release of cute

00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,870
and there it's the code base is already

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,630
there is there's going to be alpha

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:02,920
releases i think this summer and beta

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:06,370
later this year and and around April

00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,160
next year might might be the final cute

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:12,010
five release and and it's it's again

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:14,620
going to be a major release so there's

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:18,880
the great graphics architecture will be

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:21,970
redesigned and like like around this

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,010
scene around a scene graph concept so

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,070
that's every every user interface

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,500
element will will have like GPU

00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:33,490
acceleration and and can you can add

00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:37,330
shade your effects on top of any any UI

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:39,280
element or and so on and it's also cute

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,700
quick will be pushed very much very hard

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:48,160
like in today into the spotlight so

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:50,650
that's the the prime mode or they are

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,480
these the recommended mode of operation

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,790
will be instead of using in the queue

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,400
which it's put bit so to define the user

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:01,660
interface using the like UML declaration

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:04,570
language on and then then the the

00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:09,460
business logic with C++ or well in

00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:13,030
Python like for the for the background

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:14,440
and there are some some internal changes

00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,570
like the source code will be module

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:18,550
arised so that's so that the internal

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:22,330
development of cute will be easier and

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:24,790
and so on but there is a lesson learned

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,790
from the from the last major release

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:31,450
from like from the transition between q3

00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:34,900
and q4 so at this time the API will not

00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:36,280
be broken unless it's it's absolutely

00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,990
necessary for

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,580
for some purposes and even then it's

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:43,330
going to be mostly in the fringe fringe

00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:46,060
areas of the framework ABI will be

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:49,600
broken so so applications need to be

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:53,410
recompiled but if you want to use it was

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,830
cute 5 but again cute 4 is also going to

00:19:53,410 --> 00:20:02,290
be present for for a really long time so

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:04,570
shouldn't be much of an issue so ok

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:08,350
again this is still your Python and what

00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:12,730
what has this all to do with with Python

00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:15,670
development so I'm preaching today to

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:20,470
the choir here but but everybody here

00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:22,690
knows about the the what the efficiency

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,260
of writing like how fast it is to write

00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:29,170
Python code and and and I did a bit of

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:31,680
bit of digging and found this like I

00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:34,630
Triple E article 4 where they

00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:40,840
objectively compare different different

00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:42,520
languages and compared how like their

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,200
performance in different tasks both the

00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,630
runtime performance but but more

00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,760
interestingly also for things like the

00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,010
total total time for programming stuff

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,520
and and python is is very much it's like

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:56,020
at the top here like and like oh like

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,470
the leading lady leading language it's

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:04,300
written in 2000 but things shouldn't

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:06,700
have gotten worse since so perfect and

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:08,500
performance is not an issue there there

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,410
are already lots of embedded devices

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:14,350
using using Python and and the devices

00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:17,110
anyway have so much memory and and and

00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:22,570
CPU power that that it doesn't really

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:26,110
matter and and and since like with with

00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:28,000
the new or the new kinds of devices the

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:31,150
time time to market is not going to be

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,870
to be any any less significant factor in

00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:36,670
development than before so so python is

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,980
together with cute should be very well

00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:44,470
suited for their for the next 10 billion

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:48,700
segments at the moment there are our two

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:49,460
major binding frame binding protein hi

00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,000
thong

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:56,600
binding projects available pie cutie pie

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,779
kit which is developed by riverbank

00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,419
computing in the UK it's dual licensed

00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:05,179
and it's it's very widely used and then

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:10,039
there's pie side which is developed by

00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:12,350
by by the open basa laughs at IND T and

00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:19,039
it's a project sponsored by nokia and

00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:23,570
each it's L GPL licensed so we'll go for

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:26,450
a bit deeper deeper into pie cutie its I

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,610
said it's developed wide by riverbank

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,250
computing with where the main developer

00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:33,620
is Phil Thompson I think Phil is around

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,220
this conference as well but I know if

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:40,610
you see it is you're not ficus has been

00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:46,010
around forever so so the 0.1 release was

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:48,440
was done in in 1998 already and and what

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,919
it provides it's a it's a mapping of the

00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:54,860
cute C++ class hierarchy to Python and

00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:56,840
and and it's it's a like very complete

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,630
thing so it's only some things which are

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:04,399
not which don't make sense to have in in

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:05,960
Python or not not present and and also

00:23:04,399 --> 00:23:10,240
the support for four different versions

00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,240
it's very cool very good so so there is

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:19,850
support for q3 and q4 and as well as

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:22,210
Python two and three and and there's GPL

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,429
and commercial licensing available so

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,320
and and and unrelated to that to that

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:29,450
commercial support as well so if you're

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,880
a company and you want to you you need

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,539
to have have commercial support for the

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:39,230
for the tools you are using why PI kids

00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:43,039
like has you set there and and yeah it's

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:47,620
the currently the most widely used use

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,620
Python bindings projects in for cute

00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:53,659
this is

00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,419
okay these both hi cute and PI side are

00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:59,630
based on on more or less automatic

00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:02,060
automatic generation of the bindings so

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:06,800
this is a very high-level schematic how

00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:10,370
Paikea does it so it takes takes in the

00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:14,120
cute library headers here processes them

00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:16,670
with GCC XML and and then uses an

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,980
internal tool called the meta sequin

00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:21,860
meta sick database to come back to

00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,660
combine the headers with with the custom

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,300
custom source code when where necessary

00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:31,190
to create create zip files which are

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:34,880
kind of combination of combination of

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:39,470
the headers and the custom custom source

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,540
code and and the zip files are then used

00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,300
to create the binding source code which

00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:50,030
are from compiled to to the Python

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:53,660
bindings and and here it's remarkable

00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,910
that that the meta zip tool is is it's

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,070
not openly available so so unfortunately

00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:01,310
it's only on the riverbank who can who

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:07,070
can perform this full full binding

00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:10,700
generation process as a PI queued

00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:13,250
showcase I rather randomly selected the

00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:16,580
caliber application which is an e-book

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:19,790
management software and is extremely

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,900
popular both in both on Linux and

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:28,460
Windows desktop as well as Mac I believe

00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:32,180
it's a well match mature software which

00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:34,790
with which you can you can go through

00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:40,490
like archive your your ebooks and manage

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:43,400
them and edit edit metadata and and move

00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:45,290
move the books between your your reader

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:50,660
device source or send them by email and

00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:52,780
so on and it's a very like very

00:25:50,660 --> 00:26:01,670
full-featured and fancy thing to have

00:25:52,780 --> 00:26:04,910
around okay another side step so going

00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,950
to describe a bit about Nokia's

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:09,650
involvement with Python

00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:13,100
so Nokia has actually a pretty long

00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:15,050
history there so first in the Symbian

00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,440
world there used to be the pious sixty

00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,200
project

00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:24,990
providing Python and basic bindings for

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:27,780
for the Symbian platform and then and

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:32,280
and it's it's got somewhat reasonable

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:34,560
use and popularity but then maybe more

00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:38,100
interestingly there have there have been

00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:41,100
these Nokia internet tablet devices and

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:44,600
the and then and then as a continuation

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:49,260
to them the Nokia n900 phone which was

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,000
released in 2009 and there there was

00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:55,530
from almost from the beginning that

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,080
primal project provided a good Python

00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,060
environment for for those devices in so

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,120
you could they were native Linux devices

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:05,580
and and you could you could write you

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:09,510
could write code like code which was

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:12,570
basically pi PI gtk but adapted today to

00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:16,140
the device interface like this Hilden

00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:18,450
interface and later later on also

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:23,850
pikelet and pie side support became

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:26,850
available for them and now last year's

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:29,940
are this week's Tuesday this Nokia n9

00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:32,370
device was was announced which is the

00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:37,370
first me go or meego harmattan device by

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:40,920
Nokia and and there there's also a

00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:44,880
complete or rather complete Python

00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:50,040
support so it's based well the support

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:53,210
is based on the pi side binding bindings

00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:57,990
project and and it supports both the

00:27:53,210 --> 00:28:00,720
like well the key like the key among

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,600
heat quick bottles and and and give

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,420
mobility and uncute another like

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,110
platform api switch which might be

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,030
useful for for Python development so

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,250
it's a very nice device for hacking like

00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:19,170
hacking with my Python in mobile

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:23,550
environments so and this also gives you

00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:27,900
motivation like why we were why we are

00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:32,700
interested in in PI side so we want

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:35,550
so python is a is a project developed by

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,470
by this open open boss elapsed at IDT

00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:40,740
it's sponsored by nokia

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,920
and it's been around for foreign for two

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,850
years and and we released the the first

00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:51,770
stable release in in March this year

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:54,780
it's LGPL so so you are able to write

00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:57,420
also commercial software on it and

00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:01,230
you're not without need without having

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,460
to buy a separate license and also it

00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,110
was a requirement for us that the

00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,179
complete tool chain is available so that

00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:09,270
you can actually also automatically

00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:12,120
generate other bindings for like which

00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:17,910
would be compatible with with with PI

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:20,520
site from the very start we have have

00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,470
tried to run the project in a in a

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,870
highly open government governance mode

00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:30,000
so that people can can participate and

00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:32,090
people can submit submit code there

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,590
without having to sign any kind of

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:38,490
contributor agreement or so so that what

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:41,220
we try to try to that way also can

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:44,820
promise that the coast code stays in the

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:49,140
open the project is highly compatible

00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:51,059
with PI cute PI kids in general makes a

00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:54,960
lot of sense like how they how they do

00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:57,590
things and and and in most cases we have

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,250
have just adopted their their practices

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:04,710
we have some deliberate API differences

00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:07,620
like in like in places where we think

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:10,230
that we can do a lot bit better or like

00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:15,570
in which we don't want to support some

00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:20,240
PI QC legacy features or so as a PI kid

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:24,840
showcase our PI site showcase I would

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,670
demonstrate a podcasting software called

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:29,730
G Potter which has been before available

00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:31,620
for the for the n900 and

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:38,429
and other devices I think as well as as

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:41,840
Desktop Linux now yeah now we have also

00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:45,480
ported it to the or there has been this

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,730
the developer of of jeepers Thomas pearl

00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:50,809
who I think is at the moment giving a

00:30:47,730 --> 00:31:00,570
teaser talking in the in the big hole is

00:30:50,809 --> 00:31:02,519
there he is even give him a hand so he

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:06,929
has been visiting us a couple of times

00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:13,159
this this year and and and porting

00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:17,399
porting AG ported to the platform

00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:20,760
let's see how it works it might be that

00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,370
it's not really perfect because I have

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,850
no easy way to show it showed so I'm

00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:41,789
going to use the webcam of them at the

00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:43,380
laptop there so so here we have the list

00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:45,000
of podcasts which have been subscribed

00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,429
it's only one one over there at the

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,860
moment but I can tap on it and and have

00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:52,830
like the list of episodes available and

00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:54,750
can tap tap on it again and okay the

00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:56,370
text is completely invisible but there's

00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:00,330
a description of the episode and then I

00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:07,230
can play on the triangle on and let's

00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:12,049
see if the roaming works might be making

00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:12,049
just huge phone bills okay

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:27,120
come on oops oops okay

00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:30,630
well the network probably isn't the best

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,370
possible at the moment yeah but then you

00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:34,380
can you can do a lot a lot of stuff with

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:37,560
this and it and but basically the user

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,610
interface was how much did it take time

00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,610
for you to to do it

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,630
so yeah in this case the UI is done in

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:56,320
pukey ml so you don't need any of the

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,880
device specific KPIs

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,590
but things like for example the input

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,400
box of course you want to use the device

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:06,830
specific input elements that you get all

00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,550
the support for a virtual keyboard stuff

00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:12,560
like that it can be done in the UI can

00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:14,480
probably be done in one week one week's

00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:20,120
time and they're just hooking up with

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,740
all the Python code alright but that's

00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,350
about you don't probably see it see that

00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:31,070
much of it so so I'll move forward for

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:35,180
now okay and then back to back to PI

00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:38,930
site then so PI side uses a somewhat

00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:41,630
similar code generation scheme as piekid

00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:46,610
but the but the internals are pretty

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:48,860
much different so so we like obviously

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:51,620
as well start from the from the cute

00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,910
library headers but they know so we have

00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:57,680
a type system description which is a

00:33:54,910 --> 00:34:00,500
well well

00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:03,140
annex XML language stolen from the Java

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:08,710
bindings cute Java bindings projects

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:11,270
Jambi to describe how to like how to

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:14,390
describe the kind of seed the C+ C++

00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:16,910
idioms in in Python or in in some other

00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:19,790
language and and then in some cases for

00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:22,490
example how like where we need to deal

00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:26,150
with pointers and so when we need some

00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:29,750
like also like custom custom blue code

00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:32,840
and we have that and and the library

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:36,110
headers are our parsed and and the like

00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:39,020
the other make other data is makes up a

00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:42,500
type database which are then fed to to

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,990
our generator back in which then

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:49,760
generates direct direct C Python source

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:54,020
code so so we don't use what this kind

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:55,970
of meta like like a this wrapper

00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,310
approach like with with the c-pen

00:34:55,970 --> 00:35:04,029
ellipses pi q does but we create direct

00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:06,869
CPC Python source code directly and it's

00:35:04,029 --> 00:35:09,720
well only only yours an auxilliary

00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:13,269
library for for some some minor things

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:18,369
there so but but in general it's it's

00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:20,250
more or less the same and but also also

00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:23,410
the whole tool chain here is is

00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:27,099
available as part of the project so so

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,720
actually when you are building building

00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,220
building the bindings form source then

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,140
you are actually going through all of

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,720
this loop loops in an automated manner

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:39,130
and and it can be very easily adapted

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,130
also to generate generate other there

00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:50,799
are other cute based bindings or C++

00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:52,900
bindings in general okay now I would be

00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:55,480
showing like how to start Pi site

00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,029
development on on the using the using

00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:00,789
the Nokia 950 so how to start up a

00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:02,920
project and how to how to get get your

00:36:00,789 --> 00:36:10,990
first program running on the point of on

00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:14,259
the phone itself so we have created a a

00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:22,930
small tool for that called the PI site

00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:26,619
assistant and I'm going to use that to

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:30,089
generate a project template for us so so

00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:30,089
private assistant in it

00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:37,750
EP demo Europe - demo PSA tool is very

00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:39,789
much working progress progress so it's

00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:43,690
it looks pretty ugly at the moment and

00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:46,299
so on but and but it already does the

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:49,470
basic things and also I think I have a

00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:52,720
few somewhat an older version here so it

00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:55,809
so the newer newer versions might might

00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,730
already do things a bit differently but

00:36:55,809 --> 00:37:06,220
oops if I go here we have a basic basic

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:10,930
project layout we have actually it's

00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:15,020
better now we have the the main script

00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:25,100
here which is just import the

00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:27,220
that cute libraries and okay better all

00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,220
right

00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:33,460
so and this is this is just like a

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:36,680
skeleton it only only instantiates the

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,500
like the key MLB ran and then other the

00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:44,290
declarative view and and unloads the

00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:52,460
source from this qml file and if we go

00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:54,170
look at that file it's this is basically

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,690
all the all the UI our application at

00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:59,270
the moment has it's just a rectangle

00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:03,700
which forms the page and and then then

00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:03,700
has some text text in it and let's now

00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:11,150
change the text and make the font bigger

00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,980
so that there might could could be a

00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:22,630
chance to see it you know on the camera

00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:26,630
and now I can just run it here and the

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:28,610
desktop hello you're a Python which is

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:32,140
doesn't quite fit in the window but but

00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:34,760
it's okay for our purposes now and and

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:38,210
the other files which are around here

00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:42,500
they are metadata related packaging and

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:44,900
and so on so we have the basic digital

00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:50,030
packaged packaging set up for you and

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:51,680
and and also we have some other

00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,740
configuration files for the Debian

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,950
packaging set up here already and and

00:38:53,740 --> 00:39:04,210
now if we just now want to run it on on

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:04,210
the device we can say PSA build Deb and

00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:15,500
Ron their bomb who says Debbie and

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:19,850
packaging had to be difficult here we

00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:25,780
have our Debian package and now if I

00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:25,780
just cycle the USB networking

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:50,140
come on there SCP the the Debian package

00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:55,990
to the phone bomb there then we can SSH

00:39:50,140 --> 00:40:00,990
to the phone there we have our Debian

00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:04,560
package we can install it

00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:04,560
pearl ugly

00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:26,960
and and it's done and now if we go

00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:26,960
look at look at the results hello

00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:39,800
I swipe away

00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:42,240
swipe down there we have our our

00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,380
beautiful blue box we have no I cannot

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:51,660
at the moment place so we just tap it

00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:53,339
and well okay it says hello you're a

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:59,460
pattern here but it doesn't really show

00:40:53,339 --> 00:41:07,530
on there on the webcam and okay how much

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:11,160
should I have x - 10 20 minutes oh okay

00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:14,400
then I've been rushing in that case yeah

00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,670
I'll continue I'll then make up because

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,740
now the Python code there didn't do do

00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:25,880
didn't do really anything because it was

00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:30,690
just a wrapper - to start the start the

00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:38,000
qml when you user interface so let's do

00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:47,339
something something really simple first

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:49,589
go check the kml file here let's make it

00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:54,210
for example so that the like we have a

00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:56,910
timer which which triggers like ink like

00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:59,579
the so that the poet font the font size

00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:04,470
increases in the in the text every two

00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:11,780
seconds okay close your eyes I'm going

00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:11,780
to write some JavaScript enlarged text

00:42:12,049 --> 00:42:22,520
and hello which is the hello is the idea

00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:30,420
were here and then just font dot point

00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:31,670
size equals so hello font coin size plus

00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:38,190
four

00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:40,589
alright and closing bracket there that

00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:43,260
was thing we had to do in JavaScript or

00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:46,140
I opted to do it this time you could do

00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:50,150
it in in pure Python as well but but it

00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:55,619
would look a bit different and we go to

00:42:50,150 --> 00:43:02,010
to the Python side okay let's just for

00:42:55,619 --> 00:43:17,089
ya it doesn't import cute core so now it

00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:17,089
does and then this did help

00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:37,270
okay gimme how do I do it if it's okay

00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:42,700
now

00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:48,160
all right cool so okay so what we have

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:51,220
here is like we have our view from here

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,920
the cue declarative view and now we we

00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,560
have been like instantiating with the

00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:01,270
with a with our qmo source file and now

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:03,790
let's say put it here let's take our

00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:09,220
route like here the QM a row from the

00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:12,880
view object like this and and then we'll

00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:17,859
make a queue timer which is the primary

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:25,720
element in cute-cute quarters queue

00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:30,250
timer and we can connect the timer the

00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:36,030
timer is like time timeout signal to the

00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:36,030
function we created in the KML file

00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:44,650
like that and then we can start our

00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:48,010
timer we have a timeout of 2,000

00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:49,990
milliseconds and and then we like after

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,030
after that it's just like we we show the

00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:53,470
insurer the application and enter the

00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:56,980
main will open and that's it

00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:59,700
and what happens now let's see first on

00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:59,700
the desktop

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:17,010
we have text which ie okay it's very

00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,720
basic and again now that we want to have

00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:24,059
it on the phone we are doing the same

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:27,050
stuff again PSA build Deb should be

00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:37,490
faster now maybe let's hope yes bump and

00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:46,099
SCP the results of the phone there and

00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:50,400
now we can again install it here and

00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:51,050
meanwhile I can kill the previous

00:45:50,400 --> 00:46:03,150
instance

00:45:51,050 --> 00:46:16,680
come on there and if I again we get the

00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:18,569
camera hello there and now okay it might

00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,940
not show any better than previously

00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:24,450
actually I just realized that but we

00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:32,579
have the Blue Square there we have the

00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:35,040
Python text which is growing yay alright

00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:36,780
so it doesn't take that much much more

00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,880
than that to start developing and these

00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,680
devices didn't like with Python and do

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,349
it they do the user interfaces and and

00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:46,319
key ml is also it's very nice that there

00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:48,930
are but there is a few full widgets that

00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:50,970
actually defined in the q ml language so

00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,950
it's just basically matter of what

00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:56,099
replacing the rectangles and so on with

00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:59,329
with buttons and and and all the other

00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:02,569
mokemo elements and and they just work

00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:07,829
and so it's a very efficient way of

00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:10,849
defining the you guys alright what do we

00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:15,720
still have summary

00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:18,320
so to recap kit is a really really great

00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:20,410
solution for for rapid

00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:25,640
cross-platform application development

00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:28,610
its natively on in C++ but but Python

00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,010
supports is there as well and it's you

00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:33,230
can you can write code for this stuff on

00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:36,380
mobile phones or the embedded devices or

00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:37,880
whatever they are emerging device

00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,970
classes the next ten billion devices

00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,730
what might be there's a high quality

00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:45,620
support for for Python but you buy

00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:49,150
either PI cute or PI site they are

00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:51,980
having a bit of different emphasis on

00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:55,970
like what they're doing pi site is maybe

00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:58,130
more oriented towards the like where we

00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:01,040
have we have more emphasis on T on the

00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:02,600
mobile mobile devices and and and pike

00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:05,090
it has a very very stable and

00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,160
established commercial commercial

00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:11,030
markets and and what's the best of

00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:12,560
development and and with with Python and

00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,550
Keith quick you can't go wrong it's the

00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,260
time to market is unbeatable

00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,060
that's it there are some links but you

00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:21,710
can just use Google to find and find all

00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,950
the information you can know nowadays in

00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:23,950
the world

00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:40,369
hi is there any kind of integration with

00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:43,279
the cute creator oops

00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:46,609
not at the moment you can of course do

00:48:43,279 --> 00:48:49,609
the define the user interfaces with with

00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:52,999
cute creator we have been looking into

00:48:49,609 --> 00:48:54,680
it and an cute creator is also going to

00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:57,019
be in the open governance mode so if

00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,440
like if only we would have like enough

00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:02,690
time in resources we we would would be

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,839
it would be able to possible for us to

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:09,920
do it there is already some Python

00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:11,650
support include creator it does do like

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,579
automatic syntax highlighting and

00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:20,569
apparently there's already some kind of

00:49:15,579 --> 00:49:23,359
of Python debugging support there but

00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:27,410
it's not it's not in it at least it's

00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:30,289
not enabled by default and and so on but

00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:34,369
but I was talking actually to the to the

00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:36,529
team in Berlin last week and they they

00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:39,259
told that that they had implemented it

00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:43,999
to test it with an alternative debugging

00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:46,459
debugger baguette back-end so so it

00:49:43,999 --> 00:49:48,140
shouldn't be that much of an effort oh

00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:53,239
well there are some things of course

00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:56,299
like to get the the what code

00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:58,519
competition working and and then project

00:49:56,299 --> 00:50:00,829
integration and and so on but it

00:49:58,519 --> 00:50:03,229
shouldn't be shouldn't be impossible but

00:50:00,829 --> 00:50:05,660
but not there at the moment and it

00:50:03,229 --> 00:50:07,339
should be like it should be interesting

00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:09,049
for both both pykrete parties and pie

00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:12,289
side as well like new you can use the

00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:16,089
same you can use the same Python support

00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:16,089
therefore for for either of the projects

00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:31,240
hello I have a question in general about

00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,530
QT and Nokia I've read some rumors that

00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,839
Nike it's not really that much

00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:39,819
interested in Qt anymore how much Rufus

00:50:34,839 --> 00:50:43,109
is in that I think our new news our news

00:50:39,819 --> 00:50:48,339
of our death are strongly premature

00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:50,470
there actually is there are there are

00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:54,609
actually even some some internal really

00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:57,910
big projects using cute net Nokia so but

00:50:54,609 --> 00:51:02,190
which are not announced yet so so uncute

00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:05,140
is very heavily being used in them and

00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:08,349
yeah Nokia support for cute is not going

00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:12,520
anywhere and it's anytime soon so so it

00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:14,560
will be there and also in like you can

00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:16,420
you should be able to expect that in the

00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,420
open governance mode there are like are

00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,880
other companies investing more in the in

00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:23,890
the in in the direct acute development

00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,220
at least me at least Intel is is

00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:32,560
interested to continue with the mega

00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:34,960
platform using cute okay thanks how do

00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:39,010
you imagine any conflicts of interests

00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:42,940
between say Microsoft and Nokia might

00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:46,000
get resolved in the area of user

00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:48,430
interfaces as Microsoft obviously has a

00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:53,920
strong interest in Nakia and vice versa

00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:56,140
night well yeah at the moment I don't

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,839
think like there's any any internal

00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:01,329
effort at Nokia to to for example to put

00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:03,790
cute on the Microsoft phones or the

00:52:01,329 --> 00:52:07,359
windows phones but on the other hand

00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:09,730
Nokia would be stupid to to allow one

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,890
single single to rely on just a song

00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:14,650
with one single company for for all of

00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:20,380
its like like development or all of its

00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:22,270
user interfaces and and and so so of

00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,250
course the like you could perceive it as

00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:26,920
current like competing projects to work

00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:30,460
towards me mark towards the Windows

00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:33,310
Phone but but it's I don't think that

00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:35,640
works I think they're both still going

00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:35,640
to be there

00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:50,100
although i just have a more general

00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:53,710
question already devised do you think

00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:56,290
python would be supported on from nokia

00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:56,830
and in general as well with other

00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:59,770
companies

00:52:56,830 --> 00:53:03,160
I mean cutest great technology but you

00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:06,970
need to deploy as many devices as you

00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:08,560
can yeah well I don't know about the

00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:11,710
numbers like if you mean the sales

00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:13,780
numbers but but at the moment for like

00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:16,450
for for me go or me go Hartman's and

00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:18,730
there's there's there there's just going

00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:20,740
to be the one like I didn't know not

00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:25,180
know decisions about any any like

00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:29,680
continuation for that but then I would

00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:32,590
expect there to be to be me go phones

00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:36,400
coming from other vendors as well I at

00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:39,070
least heard some rumors and amigo is

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,040
using using kids and in the mobile us so

00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:45,940
so so it would be there and and the same

00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:47,700
actually the same stuff like we we have

00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:51,160
we are like I was I was demonstrating

00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:52,810
would be usable in amigo as well except

00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:55,600
for the packaging but we are also going

00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:59,320
to support support support me going like

00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:03,280
with the psi tool later on so it should

00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:05,880
be fairly straightforward thing to port

00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,820
between between the Nokia's user

00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,740
experience to generic me go and when you

00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:16,570
talk about mobile device it's also

00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:18,010
tablets you include that tablets I don't

00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:20,170
remember how it goes like that I think

00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:23,760
there's a separate tablet to UX for me

00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:23,760
go but

00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:41,470
is an ID for don't you know Thanks

00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,600
is there any news regarding having

00:54:57,390 --> 00:55:03,270
access from fightin directly to the qml

00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:07,590
components and not having to go through

00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:10,440
the qml language no I don't think that's

00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:12,060
in the scope because that like and I

00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:16,020
don't I personally I don't think that's

00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:18,900
that would make much sense because well

00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:21,180
okay you have to use Q JavaScript in the

00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:25,230
QM aside but then but then you can it's

00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:27,420
where the list like how much of the user

00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:29,310
interface you define in the in the qml

00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,990
site and how much or the interaction

00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,110
you're defining the chiamo site and how

00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:37,110
much in the in Python it's kind of line

00:55:34,110 --> 00:55:39,450
drawn in water so so if you really are

00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:42,590
into keeping much as much as possible in

00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:47,340
Python you can you can work that way and

00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:48,780
and by okay I don't think like from

00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:53,000
performance point of view it would make

00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:56,880
sense to to generalize the qmo QML

00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,010
structure so that's like it would like

00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,110
you could plug in any language you would

00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:03,000
want there instead of JavaScript and

00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,530
then also the tooling would be a problem

00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,600
because then you would be you wouldn't

00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:10,350
be able to use for example key to create

00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:14,070
or to create their the UI's there so so

00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:17,370
in that sense I I think it's easier for

00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:19,980
for Python for the Python projects to go

00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:21,930
with the flow and and and just use

00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,460
enough JavaScript it wasn't that that's

00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:25,140
variable like I just brought one line

00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:28,380
and I'm got the functionality going down

00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:30,420
there so I'm thinking more about if you

00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:32,250
if you for example now you have a cookie

00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,050
with which one rectangle

00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:38,040
yes say you want to go give it an

00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:39,720
rectangles where n is is in Python is a

00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:42,200
variable in Python and then you say I

00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,200
want to create

00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,720
yeah but then you're splitting your

00:57:36,030 --> 00:57:39,080
all right this one

00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:50,270
i I just want to mention that the Kuti

00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:55,800
Nokia dot-com website is done with blown

00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:57,950
again is done with blown oh I didn't

00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,950
know that

00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:12,220
