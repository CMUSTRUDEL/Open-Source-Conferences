	Taming the Beast: Managing a really ambitious codebase by Luke Deniston

Ember is perfect for “ambitious applications”. But what about really ambitious applications? Apps with hundreds of thousands of lines of code, teams that span countries, and users all over the world? Or apps in high liability environments where regressions from upgrades could cost millions of dollars or even put people in danger?
