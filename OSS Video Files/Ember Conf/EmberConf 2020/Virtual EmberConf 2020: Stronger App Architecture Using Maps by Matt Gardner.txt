	Stronger App Architecture Using Maps by Matt Gardner

Like the cities they represent, interactive maps are complicated feats of engineering. They are resource-intensive microcosms of state management, requiring special data formats and styling specifications.

When the needs of an application go beyond showing points on a map, cartographic applications can quickly grow unwieldy and unsustainable. Throw moving targets, messy data, and squeezed timelines into the mix, and you've got an enormous component that does everything â€“ poorly. This talk discusses the latest mapping technology and approaches to building better components - map-based or otherwise.
