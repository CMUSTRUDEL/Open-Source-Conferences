Description: 
	Stronger App Architecture Using Maps by Matt Gardner

Like the cities they represent, interactive maps are complicated feats of engineering. They are resource-intensive microcosms of state management, requiring special data formats and styling specifications.

When the needs of an application go beyond showing points on a map, cartographic applications can quickly grow unwieldy and unsustainable. Throw moving targets, messy data, and squeezed timelines into the mix, and you've got an enormous component that does everything â€“ poorly. This talk discusses the latest mapping technology and approaches to building better components - map-based or otherwise.

      it's a beautiful day outside yeah I'm                               not going to make any references but I                               am going to talk about the number one                               thing on everybody's mind right now                               which is Maps so some of the goals for                               this session I'm going to introduce                                myself a little bit about me about Who I                                am                                brief history of mapping current                                technology and getting started with                                mapping in ember and best practices                                patterns testing strategies I'll leave                                you with one very important thought                                so I'll leave you with one very                                important thought so a little bit about                                Who I am                                first of all I am from Tulsa Oklahoma                                who here in the room was from Tulsa okay                                so yeah from Tulsa Oklahoma there I                                studied social science political science                                I did start off in computer science I                                thought I wanted to be a programmer and                                then I you know my mother was horrified                                when I switched to political science but                                here we are                                although it ends well so I moved to                                Boston actually to earn a master's in                                studying urban planning with an emphasis                                in GIS so there I really discovered that                                I can combine my two favorite things                                which is technology and social science                                and urban policy so I was able to you                                know more specifically look at using                                maps as these so this is really powerful                                political rhetorical tables for                                conveying and communicating about social                                issues so this mapping technology using                                that to really to advance the social                                cause or a policy sort of change so I                                then moved to New York New York so where                                we are right now I took a job with the                                city planning department and I'm still                                mapping so the end that's all we have                                for today thank you for not kidding                                so what is the city planning department                                a very simple mission although it's very                                simple sounding it's to plan for the                                future of New York City surprisingly the                                City Planning Department is responsible                                for the future so what is this what this                                means is any new developments                                Billings any desired zoning change for                                example maybe I want to open up a cat                                cafe down the street but it's on four                                you know I don't know something else                                like residential so I want to tear down                                you know someone's house and open a cat                                cafe so I probably have to like go                                through busy planning or whatever to do                                that I'm not doing that so right so the                                team I work with is the NYC planning                                laughs we do software we are software                                duvall entomb we have to two main                                missions build great technology and                                modernize the way government does                                technology so we are we are changing                                expectations about how government                                delivers digital services I like to                                think that we are what does this mean so                                agile agile a if you will                                yeah this means a lot of different                                things to a lot of different people but                                us really it is a stark philosophical                                contrast to what is typical in                                government was just a waterfall approach                                which is all of your specs are asked for                                upfront required a front and then you                                that you know sort of you're building                                something for someone you get the specs                                and then the year later you come back                                and you have something that you hate so                                that's not good                                agile to us is really simply thinking                                more iteratively not just about the                                technology what about the relationship                                between with the customer so you know                                instead of this sort of super                                prescriptive and kind of antisocial way                                of building a technology solution for a                                human business problem and really work                                closely with customer we really we hit                                her Amy learn                                I mean we react to those learnings week                                after week after week                                demos every week design sessions etc                                open source so government has a weird                                 kind of depends on how you talk to but                                 there's there's some fear around open                                 source there's a lack of understanding                                 really about using open source not so                                 much creating it and providing it                                 although that's still there too but                                 using it sometimes there's a you know                                 this is this can we trust this why are                                 we using the enterprise solution we've                                 always used that before you know who                                 these github people whatever that's the                                 attitude that we're trying to change our                                 team is fully embraced bill you've been                                 using open source and also open sourcing                                 our own products so we create software                                 as a public resource alright so this                                 presentation is not about planning labs                                 but if you are interested there is a QR                                 code on the screen I just learned about                                 QR technology maybe last year it's very                                 cool it's I don't know I just think it's                                 cool you can open your camera up and you                                 can get a link but literally just                                 learning how to use that West South                                 Korea so urban planners use maps every                                 day so there's a reason for that there's                                 you know something is being built in the                                 city you need to know the spatial                                 context of it you need to know what what                                 is this change in this in the built                                 environment how might an impact business                                 how impact traffic how many impact you                                 know zoning or housing in the area so                                 there's a lot of contextual information                                 that planners really need in order to                                 ask the right questions in order to sort                                 of follow along with with the with the                                 guidelines and the policies around                                 zoning so our flagship application of                                 zola                                                                  day                                 okay that's not face book but you know                                 it                                 quite a lot I think for a small team we                                 built this application city planners use                                 it advocates lawyers a lot of people use                                 it a lot of different use cases so some                                 people are you know maybe one except one                                 example and where can we build housing                                 you so lot to look at where all the                                 residential zoning is and where can I                                 build in a particular neighborhood is my                                 property in a flood zone good question                                 we can show you if property is in a                                 flood zone                                                               from now there is that that availa that                                 data is publicly available to you you                                 can also look at property information                                 okay I want to who owns the building                                 across the street                                 you know what what are the other sort of                                 associated city records for that                                 property you know what else can I learn                                 about that property so all of this is                                 publicly available so here we are QR                                 code again zola you know is a way of                                 really sharing information online making                                 data easy so there's a big talk about                                 you know open data and data is available                                 everywhere everyone can access data but                                 knowing how to actually have the tools                                 to do anything with data is a totally                                 different question we hope that Zola is                                 solving is solving that problem so okay                                 if you got a try on hopefully it doesn't                                 break no I'm so just a brief history of                                 maps so there's a rich historical                                 context behind maps so it starts with                                 Jon Snow sorry                                 right so Jon Snow with an H the                                      century English physician a leader in                                 development a seizure epidemiology and                                 public health                                 you know just as exciting as Game of                                 Thrones                                 I'm also vegetarian right so he has a                                 whole biography worth reading another                                 time but what is he known for um so this                                 is probably a little too familiar                                 sounding but he is mapping he mapped                                 there was cholera outbreak in Soho                                 London and mid part of the                                              and people didn't understand what was                                 happening what was coming from so Jon                                 Snow mapped the outbreaks and correlated                                 those outbreaks with the water comes now                                 it's interesting because at the time he                                 actually his sort of findings were                                 suppressed by the water company so it's                                 a bit scandalous because the water                                 company had its own sort of interest in                                 protecting us you know its business                                 whatever to the detriment of public                                 health but Johnson was able to use maps                                 to prove his case so what about mapping                                 beyond socio political I'm sorry what                                 about mapping socio political issues                                 what about so going beyond you know                                 public health or even just like geology                                 and these sorts of things so think he                                 faced was he thinking about Florence                                 Kelly                                 I love Florence Kelly because she's a                                 pioneer in mapping technology she was a                                 late                                                             reformer she was commissioned to study                                 urban slums and factories so she was a                                 she was a labor activist and she used                                 mapping to illustrate the sort of the                                 issues in wealth income asperity and to                                 really provide a visual kind of lesson                                 and wealth inequality so what you're                                 looking here is an income map by block                                 in Chicago bye-bye residential block                                 so these are straights these little                                 buildings the black squares are you know                                 what is that under five dollars or                                 something five or less and then the blue                                 is five to ten orange in a so on so what                                 this is actually called technically as a                                 choropleth map but Florence Kelley was                                 one of the first people to actually use                                 this technology mapping technology to                                 really advance social political cause so                                 it's technically brilliant mapping so                                 don't let Jon Snow get all the credit                                 okay I'm not kidding but if you want you                                 to learn more about women and mapping                                 which you should you can follow this QR                                 codes so you know nothing Jon Snow                                 whatever okay so mapping tech from print                                 to the web so what is a web map composed                                 of well first we have a base map which                                 is stat map it's always present it's                                 sort of a contextualise er it Orient's                                 the viewer to you know where it is in                                 space so streets you know streets and                                 bridges and rivers and bodies of water                                 and parks and things like that so these                                 are all this typically what it based now                                 these are just sort of general terms but                                 then you have sort of you know                                 everything else on top of it so you have                                 data layers so these are these are the                                 sort of maybe local points of your map                                 polygons lines points yeah so what's                                 waitressing was also and Zola you have                                 you know the light gray and blue it's                                 sort of a contextual map of like this is                                 actually Manhattan just to orient you                                 but then you can turn on these data                                 layers which always a colorful kind of                                 looks like a bowl of fruit loops a bit                                 to look out for um that's that so recent                                 technologies we have our GS digital maps                                 and our GS r GS was is still around                                 still widely used but I would say maybe                                 in the                                                                 wide                                 widespread commercial access to                                 to digital mapping but you can put it on                                 the web so that was a problem so in                                      MapQuest launched its web service you                                 know it's great because you can actually                                 you know what the directions online and                                 all that stuff the problem was it wasn't                                 very user friendly so every sort of Pam                                 every zoom every time we needed to move                                 around the map triggered a full page                                 reload okay so here we enter the tile so                                 what are we looking at here                                 finally you didn't you could finally use                                 a map using tile based technology you                                 can finally use a map without a                                 triggering full page reload which is                                 exciting because it's a much better user                                 experience                                 those are very cool technology so how                                 does this work so there's all sorts of                                 like we call these like slippy maps so                                 Google Maps you know these are these are                                 this is a typical colloquial term for it                                 so Google Maps is one example                                 you know there's Open Street Map there's                                 number map with sorry that is it alright                                 so how does this actually work like I                                 was saying tiles these are really just                                 images they're just images that                                 JavaScript sort of you know deal like it                                 coordinates Mouse gestures and Mouse                                 events with positioning of these small                                 images on the screen so if you actually                                 inspect a slippy map you can see there's                                 all just tiles there associate these all                                 just images on a grid cats whatever                                 everyone likes that so image based tiles                                 have limitations so what does that mean                                 so you know sometimes you know imagery                                 style it must be generated a server it                                 you know it's it has limited                                 interactivity so you can't actually do                                 on this on the fly style                                 some approaches they get around that                                 they're a little esoteric now I'm gonna                                 do that so it's a sort of solution to                                 that you can now serve tile information                                 inspector data it means we have dynamic                                 interactions we can we can you know                                 change you know coloring of things and                                 style and zoom and suddenly in the Jeff                                 you're seeing here or actually switching                                 between a point representation of data                                 and a polygon representation of data and                                 also notice that it using vector tile                                 things we're rendering this using                                 something called a box GL which actually                                 hooks into the metal of the graphics                                 processing unit computer so it's very                                 fast rendering this is actually what                                 Google Maps the web after useless now so                                 in addition to just being able to do the                                 styling the the vector tiles also                                 include all the data so you know what                                 you're looking at here is probably a                                 choropleth of percent foreign foreign                                 air percent sorry percent of population                                 under                                                                   different sort of different core                                 mappings at different statistics the                                 reason that these can be rendered and                                 styled on-the-fly is that all the data                                 is actually present inside the vector                                 title itself so how are tiles made so we                                 go do we have here are sorry we have a                                 three cylindrical map projection this is                                 a little yes so there was a livable map                                 projection we are able to project a you                                 know globe onto a flat surface so this                                 leads to obvious distortion you can all                                 remember middle school geography class                                 it's problems so there are lots of                                 different ways of projecting things                                 and but for our purposes we use a                                 projection called when Mark ater good to                                 know but to break it down a little bit                                 assume that in the tiling and tiling                                 something assumed out the world is a                                 square may feel that way sometimes it's                                 really not so for zoom level                                           one tile for the world but soom level                                   there are                                                              if you're if you're trying to zoom and                                 you kind of get more title so zoom                                       you get more titles so that's the attic                                 to think about as sort of a pyramid good                                 visuals so that's all they're all good                                 to know another common format probably I                                 don't assignment                                 another common format is it's actually                                 probably what most people should use for                                 most problems I would think geotextile                                 um so do you do sounds good for smaller                                 datasets it's good for just being able                                 to sorry that's my uber no so Gio JSON                                 it's it's good for smaller datasets it's                                 good for really quick quick and easy                                 things basically like this with a full                                 the full spatial data is is downloaded                                 into the browser so you know if if you                                 have a very large data set it's not                                 gonna work but for most use cases you                                 really get away to use liaison that's                                 fine                                 so what is Gio Jason it's just                                 opinionated JSON format for for storing                                 spatial data so think of it as JSON API                                 but geography map data so kind of                                 putting it all together                                 whoa ok a lot of stuff going on here all                                 of this really could just do mapping                                 well not always but I would say that for                                 most most use cases the Geo JSON                                 approach                                 mapping sin with simplegeo Jason is                                 gonna work just fine but for a more                                 complicated map mapping technologies                                 this is how it works                                 and I would say for Zola this is how                                 this is pretty much exactly how we kind                                 of deal with rendering and storing and                                 maintaining all of that data so that's a                                 lot of stuff but we don't just build it                                 from the ground out there are these                                 things called cloud services Cardo is is                                 one of them I really like Cardo because                                 it is truly open source we actually did                                 run Cardo to power source backing up a                                 bit like what does it actually do it                                 takes care of everything you see in the                                 red red circle there it takes care of                                 all of that so the reason I like it so                                 much is that like I was saying you can                                 run it you're on infrastructure is truly                                 open source and we actually did do that                                 you know there's a lot of companies I                                 talked to big talk about you know like                                 it's open source you can rent this we                                 actually delivered live services on top                                 of it for over here and we just we just                                 didn't want to maintain you know                                 upgrades to it and once we you know but                                 really like how it shows how it's like                                 the opposite like instead of paying for                                 a service and then figuring out well                                 it's open source I'm just gonna run this                                 myself we actually got the office                                 expense we were running at ourselves we                                 proved the value of it and then you know                                 we run a lot of applications on it stone                                 so sorry backing up but I would say                                 Cardo is great but it's not you don't if                                 you're just trying to show a point on a                                 map you don't necessarily need to use                                 Cardo Cardo would be overkill for that                                 all it was vehicle accessibility all                                 right so yes                                 maps are obviously intended as a sort of                                 visual tools that doesn't mean that they                                 can't be described as mean that persons                                 who depend on accessibility tooling or                                 visually impaired doesn't mean that they                                 can't also be                                 enjoying and using mass the south so we                                 can still still work on this we can                                 still do a lot better so one thing to                                 consider when doing accessibility is to                                 use leaflet jazz the reason for that is                                 it's all SVG based so you know some of                                 the maps I was showing you earlier or                                 WebGL base what that means that there is                                 a little canvas element and that's all                                 there's just a canvas element you don't                                 get you don't get all these nodes in the                                 Dom so you can actually can't actually                                 put our information on them so with SVG                                 base mapping like leaflet you can you                                 can put area information on there                                 because you get all those dominoes it's                                 really nice I'm gonna say my books you                                 know this canvas base you just get                                 canvas is really hard to make it                                 accessible that said there is a add on                                 comic books you know accessibility which                                 I work you know I didn't build that I'm                                 trying to contribute more to you I                                 encourage everyone to take a look at                                 this it's a really cool problem to work                                 on yeah so basically the way it works is                                 you have your city campus based dom node                                 there and then on the other side you you                                 know you can have sort of a shadow                                 representation of what's happening in in                                 the map and it's all invisible but it                                 has it's all sort of dom representation                                 of you know maybe i have like five                                 points or six points or something I'll                                 have six dominoes for those things and                                 I'll put some information on them so                                 that you know and then you keep these                                 two things in sync and then it really                                 really makes things a lot nicer there's                                 still a lot of work to be done so if                                 you're really interested I would check                                 out my box GL accessibility it's a                                 pretty cool problem to work on we should                                 we should make these awesome Mouse                                 accessible right so case study Zola back                                 to Zola talked about that a lot not the                                 marriage app wedding I'm sorry basic                                 features many many many data layers map                                 state preserved and URL layer Styles                                 shared across another house monthly data                                 updates                                 so we need all of these things so so                                 what does that mean its way the easiest                                 way to jump in for us was to use number                                 nine important informatics GL right so                                 what is this it's simply a bindings                                 layer on top of the core matte box g LJ                                 s library so it provides you know really                                 nice declarative developer experience so                                 kind of breaking down what we're looking                                 at here aligns on line three we have a                                 sort of outer or matte box component                                 this is what's actually building that                                 canvas element it's initializing all the                                 map stuff it's you know nothing's really                                 in it yet unless you've told it so a                                 base map will be in it but nothing else                                 is really in it no data layers are quite                                 in it just yet but that's what for and                                 it lines four and five too so like for                                 you pass in again you see this geo JSON                                 type and then you pass in the actual geo                                 takes on data so that's what the model                                 is gonna be isn't geo JSON data yeah I                                 mean this you know if you look at the                                 Geo json specification any need your                                 jason you pass them to this now flex geo                                 it's going to understand it and then you                                 have this other contextual component on                                 my five called source not later and                                 that's you know that's more responsible                                 for the visual so styling of of that                                 data so mapped out source is all the                                 data behind behind the stuff source                                 layer is the styling of stuff in the                                 sort of paint property you see there                                 adheres to matte box Geo's styling                                 specification so it's you know all of                                 this was pretty the member makkac she                                 had on tries to of course get as close                                 to whatever the underlying map box based                                 API this is happening                                 right so it's a problem to sibling                                 components who depend on you know the                                 same state of something so for example I                                 want to turn on that zoning districts                                 layer there so there's information about                                 zoning districts such as a state such as                                 whether it's on that the map needs to                                 know about in the Memphis meant many                                 ways know about so when we got around                                 this is how do we you know so yeah state                                 sharing state across hidden components                                 so one way we got around with this is                                 passing in the layer passing down a sort                                 of layer configuration model so multiple                                 models for each layer passed down to                                 both components since these are data                                 models they they have their own internal                                 state and the menu can reference it and                                 then the map component can reference                                 sample keeps a UI Satan sync we don't                                 have a bunch of weird like you know                                 event buses and stuff like that that you                                 know this is one way of doing it so                                 anatomy of the map component so you know                                 when we first started this you know you                                 notice that there are several widgets                                 there are several things going on you                                 know they have a print button you have a                                 measure tool you have a draw tool if you                                 know all sorts of stuff going on so our                                 first draft of the map component was                                 very very very very long                                 I think this Jeff goes to like maybe                                     or                                                                     bad the grand scheme of things but it                                 actually it was actually interesting                                 because in this case instead of you know                                 reaching for what could have been the                                 wrong obstruction meaning assuming that                                 we know the future and that we're going                                 to need this thing                                 as it feels like we'll probably and                                 that'll be cool and convenient to have                                 that thing instead of reaching for that                                 we really allowed this sort of                                 components class or weapon a little more                                 before we jumped into refactoring it so                                 so finally after it was ready kind of it                                 was getting too long and unwieldy we                                 need to refactor so he really knew what                                 the problem was now we can start                                 grouping things together so highlighting                                 feature highlighted it highlighted                                 visual feedback so whenever the mouse                                 hovers over a part of the map and you                                 want that visual view back all those                                 concerns can be grouped together put it                                 in a component you know the draw tool so                                 being able to you know draw measure                                 stuff so all the handling for putting                                 the things on the map when you draw a                                 little if Mouse events all of the you                                 know little calculations and text and                                 being able to switch between the unit                                 take it put in a component you know a                                 visual feedback for whatever you select                                 something so again component so one                                 thing I think to take from this is when                                 in doubt make a new component you know                                 one it's it's always scary to kind of                                 you know start creating a new classes or                                 something but do you think you know you                                 can really easily clean up a lot of a                                 lot of code and a lot of complexity by                                 simply                                 okay so line two for example what we                                 have here is the measurement widget we                                 simply pass down the map into that layer                                 widget and all the layer concerns happen                                 their line for measurement widget passed                                 down the map it's really just sort of                                 separating concerns and just giving                                 things their dependencies at the early                                 need understanding what those                                 dependencies are all these things depend                                 on map instance so it makes it easier to                                 test makes it easier to choose sort of                                 split out things right so lesson here                                 don't abstract you soon and well this is                                 the next session next section tests it's                                 really hard to test Maps you're how do                                 you even an acceptance test live                                 geocanvas you don't I mean I've tried                                 it's scary all right so you you know you                                 have all these click events you have at                                 least hover events you want to make sure                                 that visual feedback is happening you                                 want to make sure that you know you're                                 not going backwards on certain behavior                                 things are turning on they shouldn't be                                 you know this is this is all really hard                                 to deal with WebGL cameras but what you                                 can do is use elaborate stowe what is a                                 stub stub is a sort of a mock it's all                                 sort of loosey-goosey terms I think some                                 people have tried to really define them                                 probably computer science journal                                 articles can you know very clearly talk                                 about what that means we're really a                                 stub is just a fake class that you are                                 using to mock a certain behavior so                                 instead of using a real map you could                                 use a fake class and just assume                                 that the underlying thing works so how                                 do you step out dependency injection                                 another probably pattern all that means                                 all that means is because we've broken                                 things out a little bit more we have our                                 Matt box basic map component line one                                 here                                 and our testing environment through some                                 of embers test tooling we can stub in a                                 yeah we can we can we can stub in the                                 map instance so instead of that                                 component yielding out a real matte box                                 jam map like it just you know yields an                                 instance we can stub it and then had it                                 kind of dummy object and all of these                                 methods here at layer outsource get                                 source these are all actually matte box                                 GL API methods I have seen some matte                                 box geo add-ons                                 use elaborate steps for this reason it's                                 not always the best thing in the world                                 but it has worked really well for us                                 another tricky part is in a box GL is                                 event-driven so you know how do you                                 simulate a mouse and move event an                                 underlying matte box GL detects math                                 mouths move and then it you know it                                 triggers the callback for you know your                                 apps handling for what happens when a                                 mouse moves you know I was what                                 something has worked for us is to use                                 something like what we're seeing here                                 which is just manually within your test                                 actually trigger that behavior and give                                 the callbacks signature that you know is                                 needed for whatever your your own apps                                 callback function is so you know this                                 way you're actually triggering the                                 behavior now and testing it but real                                 Chuck you know this has worked really                                 well for us but you're really not                                 supposed to mock what you don't                                 so you know I don't love I don't love                                 this solution but it has it has you know                                 in the absence of any testing this is                                 working really well I think ideally in                                 the future we go back to Mad Max GL                                 accessibility actually in building out                                 that add-on will really help us deal                                 with using real Mouse events using real                                 clicks to actually test behavior on the                                 map so but we need to build that out                                 first but also yeah seriously so like                                 don't mock what you don't home is it's                                 the general advice but lets you know                                 where it can be reasonable so no more                                 aggressions we hope yeah all right so                                 what great power comes really go maps                                 how to lie with maps so I'm kind of this                                 is the very important message I wanted                                 to add which is maps are very powerful                                 rhetorical tools they are things that                                 everyone sort of identifies with we                                 identify the place you can point where                                 you live                                 we've been on the map and you know what                                 I'd like this quote a lot because it's                                 you know map users you know we we kind                                 of just kind of just assumed entrusted                                 the map we've trust maps exists or you                                 trusted map is a representation of                                 reality so this is an example this is a                                 great example of how you know how easy                                 it is to rhetorically misinterpret a map                                 so what you're seeing on the left there                                 is a recent presidential election so                                 these are how people voted sorry it's                                 probably loaded yeah so on the left                                 there you're looking at the election                                 results by county but if you normalize                                 the election results by population                                 distribution you actually get a totally                                 different                                 sure actually looks much closer than you                                 could understand and the other in the                                 other one and there was one map in this                                 slide that you're seeing that was shared                                 a lot by one party and I won't get into                                 that but this is a great xkcd he or                                 something I don't know it's really just                                 my biggest pet peeve also is you know                                 you can just spatial correlation doesn't                                 mean that there's actually a real                                 relationship between these things most                                 of it's just a function of population so                                 we can see for example in his Twitter                                 data tweet you know this is in                                      there's a lot of excitement web mapping                                 was much more accessible possible to use                                 mapping mapping tools a lot of that                                 hashtag mapped thing a lot of McDonald's                                 being mapped but you'll see that they                                 these are largely just function with                                 population density so the Twitter data                                 is map there is tweets during the                                 election and then there is population                                 density so I mean I love looking at cool                                 map but it's you know it's it's between                                 rhetorically dishonest or just not that                                 interesting that's okay you know another                                 thing and augmenting a message through                                 maps there's obviously graphic design                                 choices that could be made you know you                                 have this on the Left we're talking                                 about you know gun death I have you know                                 raging epidemic it's black and red and                                 crosshair on it and and then bottom left                                 actually what you see is these sort of                                 granular bins so it creates a lot more                                 like kind of I don't know visual no not                                 yeah                                 noise I guess makes it just look kind of                                 grisly or on the right you have the                                 opposite rhetorical angle you know the                                 title fewer bins on the bottom left you                                 know and you're just scrap not                                 describing his violent deaths you're                                 describing us it's intense                                 incidents per you know hundred thousand                                 or something these are choices that you                                 can think so yeah so thank you all for                                 joining me in my apartment I the city                                 I'm learning as a lot of us are working                                 from home now um never thought that                                 would happen but um yeah thank you so                                 much please reach out on discord if you                                 have any questions yeah thank you
