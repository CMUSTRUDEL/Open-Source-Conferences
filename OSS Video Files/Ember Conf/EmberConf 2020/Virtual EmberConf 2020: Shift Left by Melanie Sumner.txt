Description: 
	Shift Left by Melanie Sumner

In this talk, we’ll look at both patterns and anti-patterns, consider how we can “shift left” in our own development practice, and consider how we can take that this accessibility journey—together.

       LinkedIn before I start I want to give a                               huge shout out to our community and the                               way everyone is making the best of a not                               great situation I think that together                               framework proves once again that we                               really are all in this together today I                                want to talk to us about the shift left                                mindset and how I think this will not                                only improve the quality of your                                codebase but help you level up in your                                craft my son brought home some coding                                homework the other week as you can                                probably imagine I got really excited                                I've been leaving him little hints like                                casually placing code for kids and                                anyone can code kind of books around the                                house where he could see them or taking                                photos of my book collection and showing                                him how many likes that got on Instagram                                anyway his homework was the kind of                                light bar code game learned about                                procedures loops and conditionals while                                helping a character move around the map                                and turn lights on and off I helped him                                get through his homework but naturally                                since he's                                                          wasn't as excited about it as I'd been                                it got me thinking about when I learned                                how to code and how other people learn                                how to code what about you how did you                                learn I've seen a few different paths                                maybe it's your hobby maybe you went to                                college and earned a degree in computer                                science maybe you did something else                                first and decided to switch careers                                through a coding bootcamp or maybe                                you're self-taught all of these ways are                                great but they are inevitably incomplete                                when you're building for the web if the                                past                                                                   anything is that change is constant and                                that means any learning path you choose                                is inevitably going to leave something                                out this is especially true when it                                comes to crafting accessible experiences                                for the web it ends up being kind of                                tricky if you're trying to interview                                folks to fill positions an interview                                process needs to be efficient for the                                company                                but some                                time's the efficiency measures taken for                                the business reasons can really leave                                out all the things that we need to be                                checking for when hiring front-end                                developers I'm sure we've all seen a                                social media posts about whiteboarding                                algorithms during an interview I'll need                                to end up with a daily work that is more                                about making forms and vertically                                centering elements on the screen so I'm                                not going to get into the interview                                process at this point but I think it's                                an area that really needs to change in                                our industry so let's keep that dialogue                                going in other spaces but right now                                let's talk about where what we can do                                where we already work now today what are                                the practical steps that we can take to                                elevate the craft of the front end                                continuous learning is a must and I                                don't mean in a theoretical sense there                                is always something new to learn for                                front-end web development and excellence                                goes beyond lines of code and to be                                clear I don't think that there's just                                one way to do this I think it really                                depends on the part of the stack that                                you're focused on and what your                                interests and goals are for example if                                you have a computer science degree but                                you're building UI components for a                                living additional study will likely be                                necessary in user experience and design                                if you're a bootcamp trained developer                                who finds themselves writing tools                                additional computer science study will                                likely be necessary to improve the tools                                you create and no matter what kind of                                education you've gotten you will likely                                need to study assistive technology since                                it's not included in most curriculum an                                example of this in another field is in                                soccer or football if you name things                                correctly typically players will develop                                the basic skill sets of the game                                 endurance ball handling game strategy                                 then players will find their niche the                                 kind of position they like to play such                                 as offense or defense in an area of the                                 pitch left right or center as a result                                 you can end up with different play                                 styles or career tracks if you                                 well I've identified three there's a                                 kind of player that develops as an                                 all-around player on either offense or                                 defense but can play on any area of the                                 pitch in this case we have an attacking                                 midfielder who can also play left-wing                                 or right-wing he can do them all                                 sometimes even after they've trained for                                 their niche a coach can act ask them to                                 switch things up and a left back becomes                                 a left wing instead some players develop                                 their niche and stay with it no matter                                 what kit they're wearing no matter what                                 kind of developer you are think about                                 the position you're playing right now                                 and further develop your skill set                                 accordingly some percentage of your time                                 must involve either deeper knowledge of                                 the niche you are already in or                                 balancing out your skirt skill set by                                 increasing the knowledge of the domains                                 that will be affected by your work the                                 next time you are at work for every UI                                 component for every workflow that we                                 write code for we must be asking                                 ourselves questions that will help us                                 keep our users in mind would I enjoy                                 this user experience could I perform                                 this workflow with my eyes closed                                 could I still complete this workflow                                 with only my keyboard if I blurred my                                 vision and looked at the screen could I                                 still tell where the focus our outlines                                 are as I tab through the interface if I                                 pulled this up on my mobile device what                                 happens when I have the accessibility                                 settings turned on do I know what this                                 looks like in high contrast mode for                                 every new feature request that comes in                                 do a quick self check do you know how                                 that new feature request will affect                                 your user experience                                 please especially think about that the                                 next time you start to engage with a                                 designer on a new feature so what do                                 good patterns look like when we think                                 about patterns what comes to mind a                                 typical pattern looks something like                                 this basic examples that show how to use                                 it variations on the basic examples to                                 show some flexibility a rendered sample                                 of the pattern so you can get an idea of                                 what it should look like                                 and some way to copy the code so you can                                 paste it into your own IDE these                                 patterns are typical but I believe they                                 are missing the essentials maybe you                                 think that it's someone else's job to                                 consider performance which really can                                 help rationalize any given number of                                 realities we face on a daily basis poor                                 management and general accessibility                                 ignorance even sometimes our own                                 laziness but the thing is even the most                                 concise framework code in the world will                                 not matter if we're not thinking about                                 the feature code that we create it might                                 be beautiful it might be easy to use but                                 if it's missing the expertise say in                                 accessibility you can end up with a                                 beautiful UI that is completely unusable                                 for a percentage of your user base you                                 can confirm this with some math what is                                 an optimal Dom tree look like less than                                                                             max depth of                                                         more than                                                              free add-on idea for you not only will                                 the non optimal experience feel sluggish                                 which really should be enough for us to                                 re visit implementation it can also make                                 screen readers outright crash if we are                                 working on any kind of code that needs                                 to scale we have to be especially aware                                 of this so what are we missing we must                                 not confuse the quick answer with a                                 complete answer it's not enough to                                 provide patterns that tell us what to do                                 good patterns will also explain why                                 patterns should also include anti                                 patterns what not to do and why not to                                 do them by investing in the effort to                                 create patterns that are the complete                                 answer we give ourselves the right tools                                 to craft better solutions for our users                                 by understanding both the pattern and                                 the anti pattern we will know when to                                 raise a red flag on a designer prototype                                 it helps us to get to the finish line                                 instead of stopping at an incomplete                                 solution here's the thing if it's not                                 accessible then it's not a complete                                 solution you're not finished that                                 about the problem yet don't stop until                                 you get there I've seen too many                                 features need to completely rewrite                                 after the fact because they've decided                                 to delay the accessibility audits until                                 later if you think about accessibility                                 as a core requirement your MVP will                                 actually be an MVP and not just                                 technical debt point three stop issue                                 sooner by equipping ourselves with a                                 more holistic view of our digital                                 products we enable ourselves to stop                                 issues sooner we can prevent bugs before                                 they even start we can increase the                                 percentage of our code base that doesn't                                 regress in the first place do you know                                 how many accessibility issues your                                 product haves if you don't know do you                                 know how to find out hint if you happen                                 to be one of my colleagues it's possible                                 to find out another thing that we have                                 in our corner as developers are tools in                                 some cases they might be tools we're                                 still trying to create but first let's                                 look at the ones we already have                                 we have lending and testing tools that                                 can help us before we commit any lines                                 of code to the code base in ember we                                 have two great options for this two of                                 these are ember                                                       template lint let's talk about ember                                 template lint in the last six months we                                 have been slowly but steadily figuring                                 out how to give the ember community                                 something special not only is there an                                 octane configuration we have also been                                 adding more accessibility related rules                                 to ember template lint why should you                                 make sure it's in your app and that the                                 accessibility related rules are turned                                 on here's why because by actively using                                 this add-on you benefit from actionable                                 insights because you can benefit from                                 these right from your code editor and we                                 even now support IntelliJ you can start                                 checking for these accessibility issues                                 before you commit any code why else                                 should you use it because it's okay not                                 to know everything it's okay to accept                                 that there are things you don't know and                                 depend on your tools to help you out the                                 Ember template lint add-on                                 provides you with the support for some                                 things you might not even know yet did                                 you know that you don't always need to                                 add alt text images but that the                                 attribute always has to be there did you                                 know that you don't have to put image in                                 the alt text because the screen reader                                 already reads out that it's an image the                                 required valid alt text rule will help                                 you out there did you know that every                                 input needs an Associated label did you                                 know that there are valid values for the                                 role attribute and that you can't make                                 up your own rule or that there are                                 different kinds of rules and some of                                 them are abstract and must never be                                 defined in your code or did you know                                 that interactive elements always require                                 a roll number template Lynn and Embry                                 live in my testing can help you check                                 these things in your app proactively                                 generating more elevated quality code                                 before you push your code means that we                                 can reduce the number of JIRA tickets                                 which will give you more time for your                                 next big idea I think this is the best                                 reason for using ember template lint                                 you're giving your future self the gift                                 of more time to spend on the next idea                                 challenge alert Mia wants to know do you                                 know what will happen if you ran ember                                 template lint on your codebase today try                                 it and see next time you're in your                                 codebase run ember template lint and see                                 what kind of issues it reports                                 accessibility audits will reveal these                                 issues and more so why not take care of                                 the ones we know about now we've started                                 working on ways to test the common                                 failures and that's something that                                 hasn't existed yet as we work out how to                                 put these automated tests into place                                 every Ember developer will be armed with                                 better decision-making support from the                                 moment you start writing code but we                                 still have a long way to go some of you                                 have heard me referred to accessibility                                 as a final frontier of the web and                                 here's why intent matters accessible                                 interfaces are the ones that can be used                                 in the way they were intended to be used                                 but we still don't have a way                                 to say here's the intent of this piece                                 of code until we can programmatically                                 assign intent to our custom code we will                                 have gaps in our automated testing until                                 we have had to look at the full scope of                                 the accessibility test automation                                 problem that we face today we will not                                 be willing to say this is how you do it                                 and this is how you don't and this is                                 what I mean about the need to shift left                                 don't wait for the audit move                                 accessibility into the design and                                 development workflow I genuinely believe                                 that understanding the needs of users                                 with assistive technology will not only                                 show us a clear path forward for the web                                 but it will also increase our holistic                                 understanding of what our code needs to                                 look like in order to create the next                                 generation of user experience for every                                 device here's the thing to me accessible                                 code is performance code is valid                                 semantic code and this kind of code has                                 a higher degree of quality to it an                                 elevated level of craft whether you                                 started knowing how to write code with                                 these with knowledge about these kind of                                 quality standards it should be your                                 eventual goal I want you to I wanted you                                 to try something when you get home set a                                 meeting on your calendar or an alarm on                                 your phone something that allows you to                                 set up a weekly check-in take a little                                 time for some self-reflection did you                                 have a today I learned moment this week                                 if you didn't figure out why challenge                                 yourself to make this idea happen                                 keeping the today I learned mindset is                                 essential for success in our field                                 maybe you do this by reading a new book                                 maybe you do this through daily                                 challenge exercises to warm up in the                                 morning maybe you do this by trying out                                 some assistive tech features assistive                                 tech on features as you build them maybe                                 you do this by reading the spec or maybe                                 you do this by thinking about what spec                                 doesn't exist yet beneath Stu I asked                                 someone once what the difference was                                 between Java and JavaScript and I got an                                 answer I really liked Java versions are                                 java's way to become more spec                                 conformant while javascript is still                                 evolving and design deciding what that                                 specification should look like this                                 means that until the web platform as a                                 whole is a lot more stable we will be                                 required to continually grow our                                 knowledge and skills I hope I'm not like                                 the one breaking this news to you but                                 our chosen career path requires passion                                 patience and persistence whether or not

us to                                 imagine the future to show us the                                 bleeding edge of tech and inspire us to                                 reach for excellence but what happens                                 when we go back to work the next day and                                 we're faced with the reality of the                                 codebase we
