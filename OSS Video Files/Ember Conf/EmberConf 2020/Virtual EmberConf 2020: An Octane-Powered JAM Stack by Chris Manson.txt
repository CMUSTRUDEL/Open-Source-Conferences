	An Octane-Powered JAM Stack by Chris Manson

JAM Stack has become a popular phrase in our industry over the last few years with projects like Gatsby and Vuepress gaining popularity at fantastic speeds. As it is a very new tech stack there is still some innovation that can be added to the mix, and Ember Octane has the power to unlock a whole new generation of JAM Stack developers with the Empress project.

      if you don't know me already I'm a                               developer at simple apps and you can                               always find me on discord or on twitter                               and if you pretty much did you say                               anything gem sack related on the ember                               community discord I'll probably pop up                                and want to join in the conversation and                                as I said I'm gonna be talking a little                                bit about Jam stock and I'll give you a                                bit of history but where gem stock comes                                from what it means then I'll go into a                                little bit of detail about embers                                position in the jam stack revolution and                                a little bit just a tiny bit on why                                amber octane is potentially a really                                unique selling point for us compared to                                some of the other jam stock offerings                                out there at the moment I'll go into a                                few projects in ember that are using Jam                                sack and hopefully show you how you                                might get involved or get started if you                                wanted to if you're interested so now                                it's time to get started but before I do                                a little bit of a issue when talking                                about Jam stack related things is that                                you say Jam a lot during the talks so I                                am going to if anybody wants to give me                                an estimate of how many times I've                                actually said Jam today in this talk if                                you tweet me with your guess that I will                                send the person who's closest a piece of                                swag or something ever related so tweet                                me a tree late if you want to                                participate if you want to guess and now                                let's get started so I'll start with                                where jump jam comes from so what                                actually is Jam stack and this quote                                here is actually taken from Jam stop Jam                                stacked up or work so hopefully it's a                                good definition                                it's actually been updated recently in                                the last kind of two or three months so                                it's actually much easier to understand                                now but I'll always like to just so we                                can experience it together jump stock is                                fast and secure sites and apps delivered                                by pre-rendering files and serving them                                directly from a CDN removing the                                requirements who manage or run web                                servers ok interesting good definition                                it's interesting though that doesn't say                                anything with John the old definition                                did say Jam and what that actually stood                                for so let's bring that up now so                                j-a-a-a-am stands for JavaScript API s--                                and markup okay pretty clear                                self-evident no okay                                I don't think so anyway this doesn't                                give me a feeling that I know what Jam                                stack actually means from just looking                                at these two things so let's dig into a                                bit more of the history of it and see if                                we can understand it a bit better                                John stack is a marketing phrase                                     created by Napa Phi okay some of you                                might have already known this some of                                you probably see this for the first time                                today and I'm not I don't mind I don't                                think this is a bad thing the only thing                                that makes me think up is respect                                nullify they have gotten so many people                                to talk about Jam stack to keep                                presentations about Jam stack to even                                have entire conferences about it and                                that is a very difficult thing to do and                                I'm actually thinking about it why never                                fie why would they be one of the ones to                                coin a phrase like this so back to the                                definition it said serving sites                                directly from a CDN and that's the                                that's the link that's the key Netta Phi                                is essentially a content management                                hosting company                                content management a content delivery                                network hosting company so they are                                focusing on serving static assets                                quickly all over the world and parts of                                what part of what makes jams acts Jami                                is this idea of not having to manage in                                servers as well so I'm not I'm having to                                maintain it yourself and which plays                                quite well for a company that does                                exactly that sort of CDN hosting and                                slight caveat here as well just a kind                                of an aside you might hear people talk                                about Jam stack as like the service of                                 front-end development in the same way                                 that the whole service movement doesn't                                 actually remove servers it just means                                 that somebody else is running them and                                 in our case there are servers still                                 running the CDN we're just not hosting                                 we're not maintaining and so you know                                 hear me talk about all this bringing up                                 the fact that it's a marketing term only                                 you might think I'm a bit of a cynic but                                 I'm not I'm already happy with what                                 never fired doing and I love the jam                                 stack and the reason why I'm saying all                                 of this that it's mostly marketing it's                                 just a much straighter jump stack isn't                                 something revolutionary it's not new                                 it's just an evolution of some of the                                 stuff that we were already doing as a                                 community you know building web                                 applications and giving in a catchy name                                 allows us to more easily talk about it                                 for us to you know gather around the                                 term and build things specifically for                                 this idea and and also you know thinking                                 of it in these terms also gives us a way                                 to categorize what apps are or are not                                 very gem stack so with this history in                                 our back pockets let's see if we can                                 move on to our to my patent-pending jam                                 stack classifications is spectrum this                                 is supposed to be a strawberry jam                                 spectrum                                 my heart still but this starts at the                                 empty jam-jar silent spectrum and runs                                 all the way through the jamyest jam                                 donut you can imagine so um my                                 developers just building a single page                                 application or an SP a did you know that                                 actually we deserve a position on this                                 spectrum um with every one of the apps                                 that we've already built depending on a                                 few things it kind of put us in a                                 different position but I'll go into some                                 of those details now so let's imagine                                 you're building a single page                                 application we tend to have this idea of                                 a separate repo for your front end and                                 back end let's just ignore the whole                                 mono repo thing pretend that doesn't                                 exist for a second so you have these two                                 separate repos you can host your front                                 end using something that like mattified                                 and if your back-end is in this other                                 repo then you actually end up in a not                                 very jammy part of this spectrum because                                 if you think back think back to where                                 the term comes from now the five doesn't                                 allow you to do the server hosting now                                 you know there's some caveats there you                                 could do it as a service functions or                                 something like that but even if you are                                 using service functions and you are                                 maintaining those it's kind of like a                                 half gem technology anyway so if you                                 want to move up this spectrum if you                                 want to become more of a mint gem                                 application then one of the best ways to                                 do that or one of the first things you                                 should do is you should be hitting an                                 external API instead of one that you                                 maintain one that you write what do I                                 mean by an external API so some things                                 that you could do is you could build an                                 application that just hits the github                                 API directly so it's like maybe a new                                 dashboard app or something like that                                 something custom using github data or if                                 you want to build something entirely                                 custom something new you could use                                 something like content ville                                 and or contentful I don't know how                                 you're supposed to say it but it's fine                                 so come tempo is like a CMS as its                                 service so CMS is content management                                 system and it's pretty cool it means you                                 can start an app really quickly and not                                 have to worry about hosting the server                                 aspect of things and you know if you're                                 building your application using some of                                 these external api's then I would kind                                 of put you just shy of the middle of                                 this spectrum in the jammie Dodger part                                 here so let's imagine we have remember                                 app it's using one of these cool                                 external api's now what how do we how do                                 we become more jamming Harry aim for                                 that donut well the first thing that we                                 have to look at is server-side rendering                                 service our rendering will help us climb                                 this ladder this Jam ladder and one of                                 the things that we need to think about                                 in these terms is that we have to build                                 fast applications I can't remember if my                                 definition from John Stowe org the the                                 latest one has building fast sites in it                                 but the old one definitely did jam stack                                 applications tend to be really fast and                                 with server-side rendering you really                                 improve the performance of your a single                                 page application or your perceived                                 performance of your a single page                                 application and we've been able to do                                 this for years we've had fastboot for                                 ages and it's relatively easy to set up                                 and but there is a slight problem if you                                 are running fast good in production then                                 you might need to actually host a node                                 server somewhere and as I said now it                                 doesn't allow you to host servers like                                 you could do it in potentially service                                 functions but I'm not sure fastboot is                                 set up to be optimum in that and so if                                 you did actually run fast food                                 production that would have you start                                 sleeping                                 them the jams Jam continuum what you                                 don't want so how do we get this how do                                 we get service at rendering the benefits                                 service at rendering without coming to                                 host your own server well this is where                                 pre-rendering comes in with a massive                                 thanks to Ed Faulkner we have this make                                 this amazing number on called primer I                                 would say writing for plaus for Edie but                                 I don't want to do that here so maybe                                 you know                                                              that                                 if you are following along and so what                                 is primer what does it do with a tiny                                 bit of effort you can set up                                 pre-rendering which is a way of telling                                 your ember application what the what the                                 routes that you want to you want to                                 build a build time actually are so you                                 have this list of you know all the posts                                 or whatever it is if you're building a                                 blog or something like that and build                                 time your app will use fastboot render                                 your application and then save that                                 juicy HTML to disk which can actually be                                 served statically so you can start using                                 a CDN and this is where it goes back to                                 using hosting like magnify and it's also                                 probably worth mentioning that I'm not                                 getting paid by notify to say all of                                 this and other static hosting providers                                 are available and so thanks to Ed we are                                 one step closer to earning our                                 jam-making scarce badge and so far if                                 you've been following along you might be                                 thinking this just kind of sounds like                                 you know a static site generator you                                 know we just it's just the same as using                                 Jekyll or middleman and everything that                                 I've said so far would definitely make                                 me feel that way and but the interesting                                 thing here about the J in J                                 the JavaScript aspect of it it's not                                 that we're using javascript to build                                 this allocation all the matters that                                 doesn't matter at all the key thing                                 about making other this modern                                 architecture is that we have a gem life                                 cycle when you render your application                                 when you get your HTML you then once                                 it's loaded you load JavaScript you load                                 you JavaScript application and then                                 ember we have this thing where once fast                                 food has finished rendering and the same                                 is true with parameter it loads the                                 Ember application the full ember                                 application and that means that has a                                 few interesting things you could build                                 something like a to-do app in with Jam                                 technologies so you could have like your                                 public to-do items as static HTML and                                 etc and all that stuff not sure that's                                 the best use case but you could if you                                 wanted to and or another example is                                 something like a blog you could load                                 your HTML really quickly and then once                                 it's loaded your application boots up                                 and then if you want to move to a                                 different route                                 you only need to load a type of JSON or                                 something like that the data that is                                 related to your next page and that will                                 vastly increase performance and if                                 you're using something like ember data                                 the performance is way faster because                                 you'd like to already have that data                                 loaded into the store and it is                                 literally instantaneous so that is a                                 kind of a whirlwind                                 introduction to Jam what it is and how                                 to do with an ember and it probably                                 might seem a bit simple here and you                                 know I'm joking here you know I've said                                 a lot of things it's a lot to think                                 about and to be honest it's a lot to                                 remember to know what to do and in the                                 Embera ecosystem we don't tend to like                                 this idea of you know here's the tools                                 just put it together yourself we like to                                 build shared solutions we like to build                                 things in a way that everybody                                 can make use of the collective knowledge                                 quickly without having to learn it all                                 from scratch                                 so there we I've been thinking very                                 strongly about like a complete solution                                 to gel in amber I'm going to take a                                 slight diversion to kind of look at some                                 of the other big players in the jam                                 ecosystem and explain how they work and                                 how Amber's solution is slightly                                 different so if you know anything about                                 Jam you've probably heard of Gatsby or                                 you press and they are a big players                                 Gatsby is for react fans and as the name                                 might suggest to view press is for                                 review facts and both of these are                                 really great choices if I'm saying                                 anything if I'm implying anything                                 negative about them in my comparisons                                 it's not true they're great projects                                 they've got great communities they've                                 got great documentation the the thing                                 that I think is different or the thing                                 that I see is a problem is that both of                                 them are quite low level tools they are                                 building blocks that you have to do most                                 of the actual building now you're                                 probably gonna have some really good                                 time you know using the documentation                                 following along building applications                                 with it you know as I said they've got                                 great communities and gatsby even has                                    million dollars in funding whatever it                                 means for an open-source project to have                                 funding time will tell and so as I said                                 you'll probably have a really good time                                 following the documentation and building                                 something and getting started and even                                 if you don't want to start it from                                 scratch and use the building block you                                 could find a number of starters I think                                 there's a Gatsby starters whole website                                 where you can browse and find where                                 people have done most of the work                                 themselves and you can start where they                                 left off and the only issue with this                                 the starters is that they are                                 essentially github repos and to use                                 other people's work you have to fork the                                 work that they've done                                 and it was great that's wonderful but it                                 means that if say the starter updates                                 you have to then do like a sync from                                 upstream and it can it tends to lead to                                 people not doing upgrades you kind of                                 locked in a period of time and that's                                 you know that's one way of doing it and                                 this is where I felt like we could do a                                 slightly different approach here and                                 what I said earlier on about this                                 complete solution the shared solutions                                 in the uber ecosystem that's where I                                 felt like we could bring something new                                 to the table and this is where we                                 introduced Empress Empress is embers and                                 surgeon Jam stack and it has a                                 fundamentally different approach to                                 building jobs like applications and I                                 don't just mean because it's using ember                                 instead of react or view firstly there                                 is no single Empress installable add-on                                 it's not a building block we have a                                 different way of doing this we have                                 essentially a set of products focused on                                 one particular use case I'll go through                                 and quickly some of these products and                                 then I'll do a bit of a deep dive on one                                 of them which is which will help us                                 understand the architecture so each of                                 these products essentially try to do one                                 thing and one thing well I'm splitting                                 them up here into this table Bay then                                 alpha just because they're slightly                                 easier the stable ones are a lot easier                                 to get started with if you're interested                                 and some of the beta or alpha ones are                                 either still a target in progress or                                 slightly under death                                 documented but I'll talk a bit more                                 about that at the end so let's go                                 through the top ones real quick and push                                 blog it does exactly what it says on the                                 tin it is a blog system and it is our                                 very first product in amber Empress                                 ecosystem and it's the thing that made                                 us is the                                 flagship it's the thing that made us                                 think of this in terms of products and                                 the next one up is is guide maker it's                                 probably something that a lot of people                                 won't have heard about but a lot more                                 people will have used guide maker                                 happens to be powering the Ember guides                                 so be good if you've ever gone to guys                                 ember.js calm you've used the output of                                 a guide maker application your guide                                 field guide is like a style guide or a                                 design system documentation - it's it's                                 different from gripe maker it has                                 different focuses and and it's                                 specifically designed to make it easier                                 for you to build a design system and                                 we've used it recently for the ember                                 website redesign project and field guide                                 was really instrumental in helping us                                 make sure that that was that the Ember                                 style guide is something that will                                 document and bring the new design system                                 of the Ember website to each of the                                 different applications over time and if                                 you haven't already checked out the                                 November website it is pretty awesome                                 and I spend a lot of time recently                                 getting that up to date so check it out                                 and let me know what you think so next                                 up we have some beta ones open slide I'm                                 using open slide right now to do this                                 slide system it's you know it's                                 interesting it's a little bit janky                                 because it's using reveal and the                                 front-end aspect in the template aspect                                 and reveal is nice but it has some rough                                 edges and one of the reasons I like to                                 use it is because all of the Empress                                 products focus on trying to use mark                                    as the basic building blocks so you                                 write all of your content mark                                       each of my science is actually just a                                 markdown file and training buddy is like                                 a sidecar app for workshops em the last                                 few are                                 kind of experiments at the moment RFC                                 process and tech survey but hopefully                                 they'll be something that people can                                 check out pretty soon if you're                                 interested in any of these or if you                                 want to know more you can go to                                 github.com slash in person all of this                                 code is there so as I said let's jump                                 into emperor's blog and have a look at                                 what it is what it does and we can talk                                 about the archer architecture of an                                 empress product using empress blog as an                                 example so this is what you get when you                                 run the empress blog quick start and if                                 you recognize it that's probably because                                 you know this has been the default ghost                                 templates the Casper template I think                                 it's called so this is essentially a                                 shallow Fork of the Casper template                                 because ghost uses hello bars and as we                                 all know ember templates are close to                                 handlebars j/s which means that we can                                 tweak them just a tiny bit and maintain                                 a fork without too much effort                                 um and what this looks like what the                                 empress blog QuickStart actually looks                                 like is that we create ourselves an                                 ember application in this case called                                 super blog we jump into the super block                                 and then we installed two atoms we                                 install and press blog and post blog                                 Casper template so first thing you know                                 is here you might not have seen in                                 permanent Umbra that's just a quick way                                 to get started if you don't have ember                                 CLI and installed globally but if you're                                 watching this you might already be in                                 the amber community so you might just be                                 able to do ember new yeah super block                                 and then the other thing to note of                                 interest is the fact that we're                                 installing two atoms into our host                                 application so we have the members blog                                 which is like the brains the system at                                 all as I call it and then we have a                                 template what that actually looks like                                 and what each of those what that does                                 are kind of go into more detail here so                                 as we saw in the QuickStart we have this                                 host app it's just a normal Emperor                                 nothing any different                                 ember New York reddit member up we then                                 install in Bruce block now numbers blog                                 uses some maybe lesser-known api's for                                 ember CLI and ember CLI add-ons where                                 when it is installed it will install a                                 bunch of things into your host app like                                 fastboot like ember as we already                                 mentioned does that for you and I also                                 generate a bunch of example content so                                 that if you follow the QuickStart if you                                 run ever serve or NPM start and you                                 actually got a blog there with posts                                 authors times officer stuff and so it                                 generates a bunch of example content for                                 you and that's it your your ember app                                 doesn't change from this point on the                                 only thing that your ember app actually                                 contains is the content it's essentially                                 an empty shell the the brains as I                                 mentioned the build system stuff the                                 broccoli stuff happens inside embers                                 blog and actually the definitions for                                 your roots as well happen inside empress                                 blog as well you'll notice that there's                                 nothing no mention about templates here                                 this is where the template add-on comes                                 in so you're embar templates your CSS                                 happen in a separate atom so that means                                 that you know your roots are defined one                                 place and your templates of somewhere                                 else that means that your template                                 add-on is essentially just HTML and CSS                                 with one or two ember templates in taxes                                 thrown in for good measure                                 so each is its and things like that so                                 and this is where you know it took me a                                 while to get to it but this is where                                 octane can really shine for embers that                                 was templates because ember octane is so                                 HTML first nowadays so he who has HTML                                 CSS experience will have a fan                                 tastic time building an empress blog                                 template and because it's an ember otto                                 you will be able to create it and run                                 the dummy app and it will show you what                                 your your content actually will look                                 like when your template is done so                                 before I get into that how we actually                                 create ourselves our own template I'll                                 show another benefit of using this kind                                 of a system because the template is                                 entire separate you can get a new look                                 and feel for your blog by just npm                                 uninstalling something and installing                                 something else so in this case we're on                                 installing Casper and we're installing                                 another popular open-source template for                                 ghost Mattila so just by swapping this                                 dependencies you're looking fill up your                                 blog entirely changes but maybe we don't                                 want to use some of the pre-existing                                 templates maybe we want to use one that                                 you want to build yourself well in that                                 case we can make that a little bit                                 easier for developers as I say we really                                 want to make the developer experience                                 really awesome for this and so has IV                                 showed before an NPM and it's kind of                                 thing this is just a helper to create to                                 get started you can create an empress                                 blog template or calling it ever comes                                 or what why and and then as i said you                                 can just CD into the folder that are                                 created for you and then you can do npm                                 start and what that actually gives you                                 as i mentioned is this dummy amp now                                 doesn't look very good if you if you are                                 familiar with the with the ghost                                 ecosystem you might recognize this as                                 the starter template that ghost came out                                 with I think it was early last year                                 January last year and that is                                 essentially just a way for you to get                                 started quickly and it gives you some                                 structure and in our case it has a                                 application template an index HBS you                                 know a post component and I think it                                 also has like a author route and things                                 this so as I mentioned we're creating                                 these example templates when you create                                 this use that helper and if you just                                 know a little bit of HTML CSS now thanks                                 to in brockton anybody who is just HTML                                 and CSS developer can come in here and                                 build something build an entirely new                                 template that can be leveraged that can                                 leverage the jam stack in all of its                                 story very quickly and this is something                                 that really excites me about what our                                 community community can bring to jam                                 stack revolution and so that's a kind of                                 an overview of what we have right now I                                 want to go a little bit into the future                                 of Empress and how people might get                                 involved if they're interested the first                                 thing I'll say is that this architecture                                 that I described this idea of having a a                                 host Emperor system ad on a template                                 alone that is the same for every single                                 one of these Empress products so a guide                                 maker has a guide made a template etc so                                 the future of Empress from my                                 perspective is twofold first of all I                                 want to try and move some more off the                                 beta and alpha products into stables so                                 people can get used can get some use out                                 of them and part of the thing hold in                                 the back is related to my second aspect                                 of this a lot of this stuff is under                                 developed under site under documented                                 it's nicely well developed but it's                                 under documented and hopefully by the                                 time that people are saying this and                                 Empress stock dev will have been stood                                 up it'll have some example content there                                 but it will have links if people want to                                 contribute and want to help with                                 actually documenting some of this stuff                                 and I over the next few months will be                                 you know playing my brain around                                 on that so one of the reasons why some                                 things are in beta is because even                                 though I'm using open slide right now                                 the documentation isn't there so these                                 are related the two aspects are related                                 and that's pretty much it if anybody is                                 interested in talking about empress                                 things or if anybody's interested in                                 starting their own blog please do try it
