	Lessons Learned from Changing Careers by Kara Luton

What do ballet, music publicity and front end engineering have in common? More than you would think. Three years ago I didn't know what a div was but I did know I needed a career change. I stumbled upon the tech world, enrolled in a bootcamp and haven't looked back.

Non-traditional paths are becoming more common place in the tech industry. There are more bootcamp and self-taught devs than ever before. In this talk we'll discuss how I bring my past experiences from two unrelated careers into my current role and why you should consider hiring more devs with non-traditional backgrounds.

     changed careers not once but two times                               so I went from being a ballerina and                               pursuing that professionally to working                               as a music publicist in Nashville now I                               work as a software engineer on the UX                               team at crosstrek we're a cyber security                                company aiming to stop breaches it still                                makes me so proud to say that I'm a                                software engineer and you told me you                                four years ago that's what I'd be doing                                now I would have laughed I had no idea                                what JavaScript was so I even HTML or                                CSS were I was completely oblivious to                                the tech industry even though it was all                                around me and that's really funny to me                                now because I'm so immersed in the tech                                world to give you a little bit more                                insight into what I do besides working                                on an awesome product at CrowdStrike I                                also blog on dev I write articles torts                                aimed towards beginners and I'm also a                                co organizer for the Nashville woman                                programmers meetup group my life now                                revolves around the tech industry and                                I'm really proud of that but I wouldn't                                be here talking to you today if I hadn't                                pursued becoming a ballerina or working                                as a means of kosis first my life has                                really come full circle                                I started out performing in front of an                                audience on stage and Here I am in front                                of an audience again just this time                                giving the tech talk my past experiences                                make me the developer I am today those                                past careers giving your perspective                                that no one else has and if you come                                from a different career path then you                                have those unique perspectives as well                                but I want to take a moment and say that                                I'm not trying to put down anyone that                                has got on a more traditional path and                                got in that computer science degree I'm                                being honest I'm kind of jealous of                                y'all I wish I discovered coding earlier                                in my life but I wouldn't trade the path                                that got me here for anything having a                                non-traditional background is an asset                                and I want to open up everyone's eyes                                that's watching this and show you that                                the next time you're sitting in an                                interview or someone who doesn't have a                                computer science screen I want you to                                think                                to this talk and give that person a                                chance because by opening the doors to                                people from non-traditional backgrounds                                you're opening yourself provide more                                diverse inclusive and well-rounded team                                and that team will only improve your                                product even more so here's a story of                                how I landed in tech I grew up in                                Nashville Tennessee doing ballet I never                                took a very seriously until I was in                                high school which is when an audition                                for the Louisville Ballet School summer                                intensive and somewhere intensive is                                like a summer camp for ballet I'm pretty                                sure I was late to the audition I had my                                hair in a ponytail I did not want to go                                but somehow I still accepted I really                                still don't want to go but my parents                                wanted me out of the house for three                                weeks and it kind of forced me to but                                because of that I started taking ballet                                way more seriously afterwards when I                                returned home I upped my dance classes                                to around                                                           wasn't taking my own classes I was being                                an assistant teacher for some of the                                younger level classes I really improved                                a lot over the next few months because                                of that then the summer before my senior                                year of high school I auditioned for the                                Joffrey Ballet School summer intensive                                and while you're writing for their                                summer intensive you could also audition                                for their year-round                                full-time trainee program a new trainee                                is one of the first steps in becoming a                                professional dancer I attended this                                summer program but at first I didn't                                accept the traineeship even though                                you're a trainee for a company you still                                have to pay for classes and it's really                                expensive there was just too much for me                                and my family at the time plus my family                                 was also waving to Chicago and I wanted                                 to move in with them when I was there I                                 turned out various studios but I never                                 really found one that fit and I also had                                 a hard time adjusting my new high school                                 I moved my senior year that's something                                 no kid wants to do so I ended up moving                                 by myself at                                                          City to do the Joffrey Ballet School                                 traineeship I was dancing                                 five to six days a week from                                          was taking to technique classes a day a                                 partnering class variations where you                                 learn solos from different ballets I had                                 rehearsal time and I even took a hit                                 ballet history class I did all of that                                 while finishing my high school diploma                                 online and when the end of the semester                                 was coming to a close I knew I need to                                 make a decision I wanted to go to                                 college but I had to decide if I wanted                                 to go and major in ballet which is a                                 real thing surprisingly or if I wanted                                 to go for something else throughout my                                 time at Joffrey I was getting a lot of                                 shin splints and unfortunately a lot of                                 those times they turn into stress                                 fractures Valley's really demanding                                 physically you're pushing your body and                                 do things it's normally not supposed to                                 do and there's obviously consequences to                                 one injury can really kill your career                                 so I decided I didn't want to pursue                                 ballet anymore it was a really hard                                 decision for me I was always known as                                 the ballerina and I felt like I was                                 losing a part of who I was but I knew it                                 was the right decision for me so I moved                                 back home to Nashville and I rolled for                                 my freshman year at Belmont University                                 as a public relations major I originally                                 wanted nothing to do with the music                                 industry but Belmonts a music school a                                 lot of kids go there for music so I kind                                 of got wrapped into it the music                                 industry itself is just as competitive                                 as if you're trying to be an artist                                 there aren't a lot of music publicity                                 firms and even fewer that are hiring                                 entry-level assistants I knew I needed a                                 stand out from the crowd                                 so I started interning my freshman year                                 and continue to do so each semester                                 until I graduated it all paid off when I                                 got a job as a publicity assistant at a                                 social media marketing agency in                                 Nashville shortly after graduating a few                                 months after landing that publicity                                 assistant job I was promoted to being a                                 full publicist I was really living my                                 dream I was originally drawn to public                                 relations because of Lauren Conrad and                                 the show the hills if y'all remember                                 that she means the job look really                                 glamorous and it definitely was at times                                 I got two good concerts are free hang                                 out with celebrities and be on red                                 carpets it was also really stressful                                 when I was at those concerts I was                                 always working typically                                 doing a social media takeover i'ma have                                 an artist or schmoozing journalist until                                 they could do an interview with my                                 client after the show when I was at the                                 red carpets I'd be running ahead of my                                 client on the carpet trying to get                                 outlets to do an interview while also                                 trying to monitor the interview my                                 client was currently doing when I wasn't                                 at a concert or a red carpet I was                                 sending out emails to journalists or                                 trying to get more interviews or                                 placements I would send out hundreds of                                 emails a day to journalists who would                                 receive thousands of emails a day it was                                 a game of luck whether or not the                                 journalists responded to me and I really                                 hated that aspect of my job I didn't                                 like that someone else opening an email                                 and saying yes to working with my client                                 determined if I was doing well or not                                 and my boss is in my clients eyes my                                 anxiety was at an all-time high and I                                 dreaded going to work every single day                                 that's when I knew I needed something                                 new I had no idea what I wanted to do                                 but I knew that I wanted to do something                                 that was mentally challenging while also                                 giving back to the people around me I                                 toured around right with the idea of                                 working in HR and possibly even working                                 in higher ed in admissions no idea why I                                 got those in my head but I started                                 reaching out to people to start pursuing                                 those ideas and that was when I stumbled                                 upon codecademy I don't really remember                                 how I found it but I started teaching                                 myself HTML and CSS I loved the feeling                                 of seeing something I created come to                                 life in front of me I did some googling                                 and I realized this could be a career so                                 I found as many people as I could and                                 started studying up coffee dates so I                                 could learn what it was like and then in                                 their day to day life I learned that                                 it's a job where you're constantly                                 learning but there's also an amazing                                 community of people that's supportive                                 and when you can get back to and after                                 hearing that I was hooked I knew this                                 was going to be my path now I have a new                                 decision to make how would I learn what                                 I needed to in order to start                                 career I'd only been graduated from                                 Belmont for two years and I knew I                                 didn't want to go back to school for                                 another four so that option was out I                                 also knew that because of going to                                 online school outside Joffrey that self                                 teaching wasn't really the best route                                 for me so I started looking into boot                                 camps I found the iron yard and I                                 immediately enrolled in their front-end                                 engineering program I was really drawn                                 to their small class size and that I                                 could fully slowly focus on front-end                                 development unlike some other programs I                                 had looked into all the stuff that I                                 remember super nice and welcoming and I                                 knew that it was the place for me I had                                 my last day of being a music publicist                                 on Friday September                                                     started my classes that I renard that                                 following Monday I opened up my laptop                                 that first day and it all hit me I had                                 just quit a job I've been pursuing for                                 multiple years all throughout college                                 and I worked really hard towards for                                 something that may not work out I barely                                 knew anything about the tech industry or                                 what I was getting myself into and those                                                                                                        learned all about HTML CSS and                                 JavaScript it was like a fire hose of                                 information constantly coming at me                                 before I felt like I could completely                                 grasp one concept we were already moving                                 on to the next but the more I learned                                 the more I fell in love with coding and                                 then towards the end of the program I                                 started doing some interviews and I                                 noticed a bit of a theme after getting                                 through three rounds in one interview I                                 was told that although I've been better                                 than most of the other interviewers on                                 the take-home test that I was still too                                 green and I ran into similar problems                                 throughout my job search I got judged a                                 lot for being my bootcamp graduate and                                 when I try to leverage the skills that I                                 learned from ballet and my previous PRL                                 I was told that they weren't relevant                                 and those rejections really got me down                                 I felt like I was always immediately                                 being judged because I didn't have dicks                                 that they thought I had I should have                                 for this type of role but thankfully                                 fast-forward a bit I landed a job at an                                 advertising agency we're almost half the                                 team were self-taught or boot camp grads                                 I stayed there for almost two years                                 before moving to my current position at                                 CrowdStrike another place that's                                 extremely accepted of my non-traditional                                 background it still baffles me that I                                 was judged for my rear past attack                                 because through interviewing I realized                                 that throughout my time being a                                 ballerina and a music pollicis that was                                 being taught these lessons that I have                                 no idea would be useful in the tech                                 world possibly the most surprising thing                                 to me was how similar ballet and coding                                 actually are becoming a ballerina takes                                 a lot of practice it looks really easy                                 but that's only because the dancers                                 wanted to make you think that thousands                                 of hours go into becoming a professional                                 ballerina girls employees often start                                 training around three years old to                                 become a professional in their late                                 teens to early twenties but even when a                                 ballerina becomes a professional it                                 doesn't mean that they stop practicing                                 or learning or try and get better and                                 the same thing happens as developers we                                 put in a lot of time learning various                                 languages and frameworks um take a break                                 for instance as much as I wish it was                                 true you don't do a tutorial and become                                 an expert overnight a lot of time is put                                 into mastering what we do and even once                                 you do become some comfortable with                                 something like ember it doesn't mean you                                 stop practicing or trying to learn more                                 doing tutorials and coding challenges is                                 often healthiest developers build our                                 foundation we'll acknowledge and how we                                 learn new things and it's the same way                                 with ballerinas they start each day with                                 a technique class going over the basics                                 of ballet this is how both ballerinas                                 and developers continue to grow and                                 learn throughout time and this was                                 something that was really hard for me to                                 grasp when I first made the switch to                                 tech I knew as competing against people                                 who had tough as four years I wanted my                                 code to be flawless the first time I ran                                 it but that doesn't happen I love ballet                                 because I knew I could always be                                 learning and improving and now I've come                                 to learn that come to love the fact that                                 with coding I'll be doing the same I'll                                 always be learning and practicing and                                 that's amazing                                 because that's always something I really                                 enjoyed when I was doing ballet ballet                                 also taught me to pay attention to the                                 small details that lies extremely                                 meticulous and one of the basic moves in                                 ballet is called a tendu in French it                                 means to stretch it may seem like a very                                 simple move but it's not and even though                                 I can't see you I want you to stand up                                 and try to do one with me step let me                                 back up here I know it's kinda hard to                                 see me but you're gonna start with your                                 legs together and your hands on your                                 hips you'll want to make sure your abs                                 are engaged and that your ribcage are                                 closed next you're gonna put your feet                                 in first position which I know you may                                 not be able to see your feet it's like a                                 tiny little bean and don't forget about                                 your abs and your ribs those are still                                 engaged and then while singing here                                 you're also to make sure your inner                                 thighs and your claws are engaged and                                 lift it but don't forget about your abs                                 the whole idea with ballet is to engage                                 every single tiny muscle so you're                                 appearing as tall as possible and you                                 can just stand be here like this it's                                 really hard and you're not even doing a                                 table yet it's not something natural for                                 your body to do so let's actually do it                                 on you now while keeping everything                                 engaged and lifted you're gonna push                                 your foot into the ground                                 make sure your ball of the foot is                                 really pushing in and then make sure                                 your foot is pointed and fully stretched                                 and turned on you wanna keep your like                                 turned out but you can't forget about                                 your inner thighs your cloths your ass                                 everything's still engaging lift it it's                                 really hard ever make y'all sit down                                 look toward to you any longer so the                                 more advanced moves that starts out with                                 the Tundra's called a romper say and I                                 will not make you all try this one when                                 first learning to do with a lot of                                 ballerinas make the mistake of not                                 paying                                 attention to the star D a limit on do                                 instead focus on getting their leg up                                 into that half turn but paying attention                                 to the small details of the tendu and                                 activating every single one of your                                 muscles really pushing your foot into                                 the floor and pointing through your                                 whole foot                                 it's what's giving you the power to do                                 the move and execute it correctly so how                                 is the similar coding first of all there                                 have been dozens of times I've                                 overlooked something as simple as a                                 semicolon half an hour later when my                                 code isn't compiling I'm sitting there                                 laughing at myself because I'd realized                                 what I missed and I do the same thing                                 with ballet whenever I was struggling                                 with a certain move my teacher would                                 have me take a step back and break it                                 down piece by piece similar how to                                 review smaller sections of code when you                                 find something's wrong and a lot of                                 times with ballet or code it's those                                 small details that matter and it's extra                                 important when coding because those                                 small details play into other decisions                                 like if you install the extra dependency                                 or not those decisions affect the people                                 that use our product they can cause                                 things like performance issues and we                                 need to take that into consideration the                                 small details make a difference in our                                 day-to-day work and paying attention to                                 them can save both you and your                                 customers minutes or even sometimes                                 hours of frustration possibly one of the                                 biggest things that I taught me was how                                 to get feedback and not take it                                 personally both ballet and coding are                                 extremely personal in ballet you're                                 telling a story through your body and                                 encoding you're building something from                                 scratch there's no such thing as being                                 perfect in either ballet or in code I                                 was in class or her salon received no                                 feedback and that was waste of time                                 because I wasn't learning how to improve                                 and I feel the same way when I submit                                 code for review I want people just to us                                 how I could have done something                                 differently or catch a mistake I may                                 have missed I craved that feedback                                 because a person is doing it because                                 they want me to grow and learn and award                                 Rorty of the time when someone makes a                                 comment on my code it's something that I                                 hadn't realized before you can't grow                                 without that feedback                                 that's how ballerinas develop their                                 artistry and how we as engineers develop                                 better code                                 I'm really amazed that all the things                                 that they taught me but being a PR also                                 taught me several things I use day to                                 day as a developer one of the things I                                 constantly use from PR are my writing                                 skills whether it was writing an email                                 or writing press releases I was always                                 writing and when I was doing so as                                 extremely particular not only about the                                 words I was using but about how concise                                 I was being selecting the right word to                                 perfectly convey my message and keeping                                 everything short and sweet could mean                                 the difference between a journalist                                 opening and reading my email and saying                                 yes to an opportunity or not and not                                 only does that help me as someone who                                 enjoys giving talks and writing blog                                 post but it helps me my day-to-day life                                 as a developer as developers our day is                                 it's been exclusively writing code we're                                 climbing the code explaining to others                                 why we chose something to do a                                 particular way or even writing                                 documentation being concise and clear                                 doing those not only helps yourself when                                 you come back to something you've worked                                 on previously but helps anyone                                 interacting with anything that you've                                 done PR also taught me how to work as a                                 team there's this thing that people in                                 PR or people in people who aren't                                 developers excuse me do so because you                                 don't want to work with others but I                                 probably work with people more so now                                 than I did when I was in PR as a                                 publicist I worked with managers record                                 labels and marketing teams it all worked                                 together to put it to it                                 we'd all work together to put together a                                 vision for our artist and execute it                                 correctly                                 Nessus developers we do the same now                                 tech day goes by that I'm not reaching                                 out to someone else on the team whether                                 it be managers designers writers                                 researchers or other developers                                 sometimes is a question for a designer                                 sometimes a pairing with another                                 developer as developers were interacting                                 with so many different people across so                                 many different teams it's vital to have                                 those strong team working skills and                                 that's something that really makes the                                 difference between a good and a bad                                 developer working as a publicist didn't                                 only teach me things I use in my                                 day-to-day life as a dev but also taught                                 me                                 the important things that were useful                                 when I was interviewing the first is                                 that although I think it hated sending                                 those hundreds of emails a day to                                 journalist that it really taught me how                                 to stand out amongst the crowd all                                 journalists ratinho to receive a ton of                                 emails a day from publicist vying for                                 their attention                                 it made me become creative not only my                                 pitches but even the subject lines of my                                 emails something as simple as including                                 hello and the journalist name was unique                                 enough to get me a couple more views                                 that I wasn't kidding before I took what                                 I learned and I applied it when I was                                 for a shop search Inc there are a lot of                                 you develop her roles out there but also                                 a lot of people applying for the same                                 role I want to make sure that my                                 application was unique so now I was                                 applying for jobs I created a custom                                 email template that I sent along with my                                 resume it included the company's logo                                 and then was all done in their brand                                 colors it was the most advanced thing it                                 honestly wasn't the prettiest it was                                 enough to make me stand out and would                                 not ask that company why they chose to                                 interview me from a stock of applicants                                 it was often because of those emails the                                 second thing that PR taught me is great                                 interview skills a big part of my job                                 was training my clients how to interview                                 I'd help them practice the questions                                 they typically get how to answer                                 something if they didn't know what to                                 say and how to leave their personal                                 story throughout their interview                                 developers are often most concerned with                                 the technical interview which obviously                                 is a big part of the interviewing                                 process but in order to get there you                                 have to get through that                                 getting-to-know-you interview first so I                                 took what I teach my clients and I've                                 lied that to myself I thought a lot                                 about the common questions I'd be asked                                 and I knew I'd always be asked about my                                 career transition so now when I'm asked                                 at all of the interviewer little more                                 about myself I talk about why I decided                                 to make the switch then throughout the                                 rest of my interview I talk about the                                 things I learned from being a ballerina                                 and a publicist and how that helps me as                                 a developer I tell a story at my                                 interview much like I would teach my                                 clients to do one of the biggest                                 takeaways I have from both ballet and PR                                 is that community is important I didn't                                 have a community either in my past                                 careers                                 Vala is extremely competitive there's                                 only so many roles and always                                 any spots in a company some companies                                 even compete make you compete each year                                 for what level you'll be within the                                 company and PR is the same way each                                 publicist is vying for the attention of                                 the same journalist besides the people I                                 worked with I didn't really have anyone                                 I could turn to and ask questions I was                                 amazed when I was at my boot camp seeing                                 how supportive of our community is                                 through Twitter chats slack groups                                 meetups and conferences it's a part of                                 the reason why I wanted to be a co                                 organizer for the Nashville women                                 programmers when I was the publicist I                                 had a plan a lot of events I did ice                                 cream socials invited journalists music                                 video shoots and I even let bar hopping

                       over an hour about what the impr taught                                 me there are so many more things that                                 I've learned than what I've talked about                                 but my story is just one of a few people                                 who now work in tact after previously                                 coming from a non-traditional background                                 in fact according to this                                            Overflow survey thirty seven point six                                 percent of people working in tech now                                 who have a college degree do not have a                                 computer science degree there are more                                 people in tech who come from that                                 non-traditional background than ever                                 before and with the popularity of boot                                 camps and people self teaching to make                                 the switch the numbers only going to                                 continue to grow my aunt Denise is                                 actually one of those people who made                                 the switch to tech and I'm extremely                                 proud of her she left her job as a

code while working in                                 the outdoor recreation and customer                                 service industries now she works as                                 developer at Lewis communications in                                 Brentwood Tennessee another amazing                                 story is iki oh I was introduced to him                                 through that through the weekly code                                 newbies Twitter chats and I'm really                                 fascinated about his story he studied in                                 Arras Israel to originally become a                                 rabbi but then                                 to attend the flatiron school's bootcamp                                 in your city now he works as a software                                 engineer there and blogs about tech on                                 his site rabbi on Rails these are just a                                 few of the amazing stories of people who                                 made the switch to tech I posted all of                                 dev asking for more stories I received                                 so many responses people who transition                                 from being social media managers                                 teachers translators architects                                 musicians aircraft maintenance engineers                                 and more we've heard time and time again                                 that coding is the future there are so                                 many job opportunities in this field and                                 that isn't stopping anytime soon                                 we need more candidates so why do people                                 have this mentality that someone who                                 doesn't have a computer science degree                                 doesn't belong by saying that you're                                 rejecting people like Nikhil my aunt                                 Denise Amanda myself and so many more                                 people who could only add to your team                                 so what can we do to make our hiring                                 process more inclusive to those who have                                 non-traditional backgrounds doing                                 something as simple as removing the                                 requirement of having a computer science                                 degree from your listing will attract                                 even more applicants there's been                                 numerous times when I then applied to a                                 job listing because I had a CS to re                                 requirement then during your interviews                                 assess candidates for their potential we                                 downplay having a strong soft skills                                 attack but we shouldn't be those soft                                 skills are things like problem solving                                 initiative learn and mentoring others                                 and those are transferable don't put as                                 much emphasis on a candidate's potential                                 don't put as much emphasis on a                                 candidate's credential as I mean but                                 instead take a look at those                                 transferrable skills your tech stack can                                 always be taught but those are the                                 skills but those transferable skills are                                 the ones that are tougher to learn and                                 in my opinion or what makes a really                                 good candidate become a really great                                 candidate if you're on the other end of                                 the spectrum and searching for a job                                 when you don't have a CS degree take a                                 step back and look at what I've what                                 you've done in the past do what I've                                 done in this talk see where you can pull                                 similarities from your past experiences                                 and use those to your advantage                                 weave those things you've learned                                 throughout your interviews to show how                                 much of an asset                                 can be and prove that even though you                                 may be new to their team now that                                 eventually you're going to be their next                                 senior engineer so as a former ballerina                                 turned music publicist or a software                                 engineer if I can find similarities                                 through those three very drastic careers                                 than anybody else can those past                                 experiences give me the strength in my                                 career as a developer and they shouldn't                                 be treated as if they don't thank you so                                 much
