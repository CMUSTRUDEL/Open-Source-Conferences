circumstances not getting to actually be                               there still really glad that the show                               has gone on                               I'm Nicole Sullivan I am crows pins and                               frameworks and he had to talk a little                               bit about chrome and frameworks                                collaborating now this was always going                                to be a talk about collaboration but                                with everything going on in the world                                right now I didn't feel right to talk                                about collaboration between chrome and                                frameworks without pulling in the larger                                context now I want to give you content                                morning I am going to talk about Kovan                                                                                                something you want to hear about                                probably want to turn off the video                                difficult times call us to pull together                                even more for example in China they                                built a hospital in ten days to                                accommodate folks with coronavirus let's                                see them do it                                [Music]                                if incredible the number of cranes they                                have operating all at the same time I                                and a former life was a carpenter but I                                was never on a jobsite with more than                                one crane                                you can see it looks like they are also                                building the pods that it's made of                                off-site so that they aren't taking up                                space there to build the pods as well                                it's very very efficient way to build                                very smart                                [Music]                                and obviously they're keeping the                                jobsite going day and night                                [Applause]                                it's a terrible amount of activity                                happening and how how relatively                                coordinated in this the roof tiles are                                pretty interesting as well as a former                                carpenter really impressed I was never                                that good so another example of                                collaboration is they want Wuhan medical                                workers who work tirelessly to heal                                their patients this is the medical staff                                celebrating the closing of one of the                                temporary hospitals recently China                                reported just                                                         don't need temporary hospitals anymore                                one thing I think is that we need to                                heal our institutions if we're going to                                face the challenges in front of us this                                applies to the web as well as to the                                world now those things that I showed you                                are big things building a hospital in                                ten days is enormous but I've also seen                                a lot of small kindnesses too there are                                so many beautiful things that people                                have done I tweeted this yesterday is it                                just me or people being decidedly kinder                                to each other right now I believe                                healing begins with kindness and the                                virus calls on us to be more                                collaborative more caring and to look                                out for one another Chris Martin of                                Coldplay said it feels like right after                                                                                                       did an Instagram concert for fans stuck                                at home due to the crisis Alec Laura                                Benanti a Broadway actress with five                                Tony nominations speak for herself about                                the the kindness that she did in her own                                words this is all insane very few people                                are at work most of my stuff is getting                                cancelled because                                I'm in the business of being around a                                lot of people as most of us are and this                                may seem silly but I know that a lot of                                high schools we're gonna have their                                musicals and those musicals got canceled                                and that is a bummer because I know for                                so many of us I know for me my high                                school musical was like a lifesaver so                                if you would like to thing a song that                                you are not going to get to sing now and                                tag me I want to see you I want to hear                                it                                say safe everybody so that's for                                reaching out to high school students who                                missed out on their opportunity to                                participate in their high school musical                                another person max Barnett who is an                                Oakland author right near me I realized                                how hard it is for parents to work whose                                 kids are out of school basically                                 indefinitely and he decided to do                                 something about it every day at                                         he's reading one of his books Oliver                                 Jeffers offered to read one book a day                                 until it's safe to go outside and this                                 is an example of his beautiful                                 illustrations as well as this other                                 illustration that he did reminding us                                 that when it comes to a virus we're all                                 only as safe as the least among us he's                                 right now more than ever we should think                                 we and not me                                 another artist Wendy MacNaughton who                                 does these incredible illustrations and                                 infographics is offering up drawing                                 lessons to kids and I'd like to put out                                 there that you'd only are recording all                                 these talks and putting on a virtual                                 conference and means an awful lot that                                 you and the rest of the team would work                                 this hard so this spirit of                                 collaboration is something the web                                 platform needs to and so I'd like to                                 look at what's happening there and pull                                 it back into what we can make a bit in                                 the web platform sometimes I wake up and                                 my Twitter notifications are through the                                 roof and like so many that they put the                                 little plus icon in there and stop                                 counting and I feel nervous did I tweet                                 something that I take a mistake the                                 night before did I tweet something                                 impulses that I shouldn't have or has                                 the world blown up again around web                                 components and frameworks I just can't                                 with all that I completely understand                                 why people get angry but Twitter wars                                 about web components never go anywhere                                 except they go on and on and on for days                                 let's just start by recognizing that                                 frameworks are part of the web platform                                 if you're using a framework you are                                 using the web platform and we really                                 want your feedback this hasn't always                                 been the case that there were many                                 avenues to give feedback but we're                                 really interested in it now if there's                                 anything you hear about happening on the                                 web platform and you want to figure out                                 how to get involved feel free to contact                                 me stubborn Ella is my twitter handle                                 and it is actually the best way to get                                 hold of me if you want a quick response                                 so please don't hesitate to reach out so                                 Chrome has changed                                 working with frameworks like ember is                                 now a core blinkin web platform and                                 objective it's in our yearly goals we                                 succeed if you succeed we also hired own                                 frameworks p.m. that's me we added                                 feedback from framework authors to our                                 release process that's one of the steps                                 that our engineers need to follow very                                 senior blink engineers are reaching out                                 to the community and we have several                                 teams dedicated to working with                                 frameworks now for many years chrome                                 tried to build a framework around web                                 components when I started working in the                                 space we had the realization that having                                 a framework under the chrome umbrella                                 meant that we were competing with our                                 best partners so what did we stop doing                                 polymer was sunsetted before I joined we                                 recognized that our effort in that area                                 never really saw significant adoption                                 and didn't really meet the performance                                 goals that we had in                                 so it was time to make a change but what                                 do we do next I reached out to a few                                 framework authors before I started and                                 ask them for their wish list for the web                                 platform and this link a pretty good                                 place to start because we got lots of                                 good feedback there we started                                 collaborating with the react team hoping                                 that it could spur innovation that the                                 whole ecosystem had benefit from we can                                 put resources into figuring out the most                                 efficient ways for frameworks to do                                 certain things that they need to do and                                 then other frameworks can learn from                                 that and figure out how it should work                                 in their world we started having weekly                                 meetings and we had some off sites                                 together to design a scheduler it's been                                 pretty fascinating to watch cross team                                 collaboration actually happen so now we                                 collaborate to make the web awesome and                                 we recognize that this is actually what                                 you wanted the entire time this couldn't                                 have happened without framework authors                                 generosity and being willing to give                                 second chances and a new start so I'm                                 personally very grateful thank you I                                 know                                 it was hard at first so if there's                                 anything I brought to Chrome it was the                                 understanding that free monks and the                                 web platform are two halves of the same                                 whole when we work together outcomes for                                 both developers and users are                                 significantly better we're really                                 exciting excited about continuing to                                 collaborate with frameworks particularly                                 around performance so one honest piece                                 is that performance outcomes are                                 actually not agreeing for everyone                                 they're great on my iPhone but they're                                 not amazing on a lesser phone in a bad                                 Network or flaky Network particularly in                                 emerging markets and                                 something we care about because that's                                 where the web needs to grow now I want                                 to put to rest the idea that one                                 framework is that much faster or                                 significantly better than any other                                 framework I'm not going to tell you                                 which ones which in this chart but you                                 can see that there's not a huge                                 difference in performance between them                                 as well you'll notice they all have a                                 pretty big difference between their time                                 when they show pixels which is the two                                 blue lines roughly and the time to                                 interactive which is when the user can                                 actually click on and interact with                                 things so yeah I think that the sort of                                 ward framework or is back and forth                                 don't don't actually make a lot of sense                                 there there isn't a huge difference in                                 performance here and to get these                                 numbers we did a survey of over                                   million domains and so we wanted to make                                 sure that it wasn't a a benchmark or                                 something that could be inaccurate or                                 overemphasize something that it's not as                                 important so I'd like to propose a                                 shared goal between framework authors                                 and application authors and browsers                                 users want amazing features and great                                 performance we will make it so the                                 community is already building amazing                                 features so I'm going to focus on                                 performance I honestly think that                                 building amazing features is part of the                                 reason why people choose a framework in                                 the first place it allows them to get up                                 to speed quicker to release features                                 quicker and build their release more                                 sophisticated features because they're                                 not spending all of their time on                                 underlying code and let's be clear                                 frameworks sometimes make web apps                                 slower but they're also our best hope to                                 make them faster why do I say that                                 standardizing things is actually fairly                                 difficult you have to have a lot of                                 consensus you to make sure it's going to                                 work in every single browser sometimes                                 we can't get to the end state of the API                                 of our dreams                                 in the browser itself but frameworks                                 generally speaking have more flexibility                                 in regard to that and can take advantage                                 of a lower level API we built and then                                 build something on top of it that makes                                 it easier for their users to consume                                 within the paradigms that their RNA used                                 to thinking about so let's just stop and                                 look at what do users want in the first                                 place the first thing they want is to                                 see pixels fast the next thing they want                                 is for the page to be interactive fast                                 and the third thing they want is it to                                 be fast to get to the next route once                                 their pages already loaded or you know                                 whenever they're ready to go they're                                 four pixels we're kind of doing ok a                                 combination of server-side rendering or                                 statically generated pages does an ok                                 job here it can be complicated to do                                 well if the page is very complex or if                                 the backends are slow we also probably                                 don't want to fetch all of the data in                                 order to be able to put any of the page                                 in front of the user that's something                                 we'd like to disconnect I believe in the                                 underworld that's the things checkout is                                 fast food so paradoxically when we show                                 pixels quicker the longer the page looks                                 ready but isn't actually interactive yet                                 rage clicks or something that happened                                 when users click over and over and over                                 again in frustration and waiting for                                 JavaScript to do its thing                                 one of the fundamental goals of the                                 browser is to handle user input                                 instantaneously so the page needs to be                                 ready at least the parts that the user                                 is going to interact with let's compare                                 a single page app on the top and a multi                                 page on the bottom the rectangles                                 represent the load time of an individual                                 view page route something like that                                 obviously the sizes are completely                                 made-up it's just to present                                 point and propose an understanding so                                 you can see that there's a UX trade-off                                 being made between the initial and                                 subsequent loads the single page app has                                 a slower initial load and then very fast                                 subsequent page loads the multi-page app                                 has a somewhat faster initial load and                                 then they'd seen that sort of first                                 impression experience and then the                                 subsequent pages are still pretty low so                                 we have some pretty good perf                                 measurements for the first page load                                 that tell us the time to pixels on the                                 screen and interactivity we really don't                                 have very good single page app metrics                                 for hydration time and transition timing                                 so what that means is that you've been                                 grappling with UX trade-offs that are                                 metrics don't capture I also think we're                                 asking too much of application                                 developers when you're working on an                                 application you have a day job building                                 features I think what I see is                                 application developers care a lot about                                 things like accessibility and                                 performance and semantics but often are                                 particularly a lot of time to work on                                 them                                 and the trade-offs in complexity are                                 actually pretty hard to navigate how do                                 you make your application code yield                                 every few milliseconds within the                                 context for framework that doesn't have                                 that feature where it isn't turned on                                 yet that's pretty hard to do and so I                                 actually think that this presents an                                 exciting opportunity for frameworks and                                 the web platform to collaborate we both                                 want application authors to be                                 successful out of the box and there are                                 things that are easier done in a                                 framework and then there are other                                 things that are easier done in the                                 browser and when we work together to                                 define the line between the two                                 application developers win so let's talk                                 about ember specifically for a moment I                                 would level with you a lot what I'll                                 talk about amber how already has done                                 but because of the differences in how                                 people define a framework most folks                                 weren't thinking about it that way                                 but give you an example on the left here                                 in UI frameworks their main job is                                 updating the view and making sure the                                 view reflects the model and the data                                 that you have available on the right                                 have SDKs like next jeaious next gatsby                                 and those are more responsible for the                                 server client integration and the                                 lifecycle of an application honestly                                 they're responsible for a lot more of                                 the proponents piece of the puzzle than                                 the UI frameworks are then what do we do                                 about angular and ember because they                                 actually kind of fall into both counts                                 they are a UI framework and library they                                 definitely take care of updates to their                                 view and them they're also an SDK or a                                 CLI that does similar things basically                                 setting up routes and doing that server                                 client integration so that makes it a                                 little more complicated to compare these                                 against each other in a meaningful way                                 so given the complexity there why should                                 chrome invest in the framework ecosystem                                 why should we spend time improving these                                 tools to take a look at this let's look                                 at some data first from an MDM survey                                 they did a survey of developers and                                 designers it reached almost                                        people who responded to it and we found                                 that                                                                     or view so that's huge it's clear that                                 developers are choosing to use                                 frameworks more than                                                   on a chrome are on pages that use a                                 JavaScript framework again                                             seem huge but it actually it really is                                 an enormous leverage one more                                 in the top hundred URLs by timespan if                                 we look at react with you and angular we                                 see that                                                               applications that use those frameworks                                 what the difference between time spent                                 and and page loads shows us is that well                                 for one the frameworks are more likely                                 to be single page apps but also users                                 are spending more of their time and so                                 the the applications that are using                                 frameworks are more important to the                                 users day once you had internal Google                                 frameworks bootstraps some other sorry                                 backbone and some other things it grows                                 to                                                                   grows all the way to                                                 argue whether jQuery should be included                                 in the framework bucket because it is a                                 little bit different but it's worth                                 looking at the data so what is chrome                                 doing to help we're collaborating on                                 answers to many questions we're                                 researching lots of things we're testing                                 it with partners we're making sure that                                 everything we're doing works in                                 production before we ever recommend it                                 to anyone else so some of what we're                                 working on right now each thing is in                                 different stages is loading code and                                 data scheduling important tasks                                 contributing metrics that properly                                 capture hydration time and single page                                 out transitions for the moment we've                                 contributed that next chance we're going                                 to get a bunch of data back about what                                 we see there and verify that those                                 metrics actually make sense and will                                 work in a broader context ember has                                 these sort of metrics built in so again                                 really lucky to be working on a                                 framework that has had this sort of                                 thoughtfulness around performance we're                                 also looking at routing values in a much                                 earlier stage we're excited about                                 Mozilla shared libraries the idea                                 that if everyone is using moment jacks                                 why do we need to have multiple copies                                 of it could everybody not share one copy                                 of moment yes since it is used so                                 ubiquitously it wouldn't really give                                 away any user data we're also interested                                 in conformance tests it does know when                                 they make a mistake we feel like the                                 code review is too far out to figure out                                 that you you made a mistake in building                                 the application so we want to add                                 performance tests that catch common                                 common errors like your locking and                                 loading your your CSS too late and so                                 the page is to stay blank and it's                                 pushing out your your largest content                                 will pain that kind of thing we've also                                 done a bunch of improvements to bundle                                 size that were pretty excited about that                                 shipped in next chance and are actually                                 web pack improvements and so they're                                 getting sucked in by gatsby as well and                                 i've heard a little bit i'm you know                                 that he's excited about this stuff and                                 that he might consider having having you                                 our underlying tools use use webpack so                                 that you can also take advantage of                                 those same here is ticks and that we're                                 also collaborating with microsoft to                                 bring form controls from                                                 frameworks are bringing the power of                                 tools like of companies like Netflix we                                 did Facebook or Google to the open web                                 we want those solutions to work for                                 everybody but that's very complicated to                                 do because open-source tooling is fairly                                 complicated our goal is to prove that it                                 can work in next Genesis and react and                                 share what we learned with the entire                                 ecosystem of frameworks we also learn                                 from each of the frameworks which each                                 one has its specialty the thing that                                 it's best                                 and we've been able to take in a lot of                                 information about what primers have                                 tried already and where we might go next                                 we also see that y'all copy from each                                 other and I think that's great                                 that's the kind of collaboration and                                 inspiration that will make us all take a                                 step change improvement in the users                                 experience of the web so the web is                                 essential for so many things including                                 the kind of sharing that allows people                                 to take what they want what they do well                                 and share with people around the world                                 in a time of crisis so I grew up in a                                 tiny back then very isolated community                                 on the Maine coast it's a little island                                 and you had to drive                                                 traffic light it's a rugged community                                 that deeply cares about each other and                                 understands that it's thanks to both our                                 independence and our interdependence                                 that we thrive I remember at some point                                 I realized I had read all the books in                                 the library that interested me there                                 were no more I took a lot of that what                                 it would have meant to me as a child to                                 have all the world's information                                 available to me because of the Internet                                 the island is no longer isolated I                                 watched the local basketball games                                 online I find out who won the lobster                                 boat races from the local paper and I                                 stay close to my sister in spite of the                                 distance I haven't been back in years                                 but it doesn't seem all that far away                                 the web is an incredible equalizer when                                 for the price of a phone plan someone                                 can discover that they're not the only                                 queer kid being inspired by beautiful                                 art even if they never set foot in a                                 plane or educate themselves even if the                                 library doesn't have any more books so                                 when I try to do it's right for the web                                 platform part of me is doing it for that                                 girl standing in the library hoping to                                 find                                 another book the thing that we're making                                 here it matters it's really important                                 and browsers can't do it alone                                 we need to walk shoulder the shoulder                                 with frameworks tools SDKs application                                 authors the web needs to be fast to be                                 healthy and together we can make it so                                 so I encourage you when you turn off the                                 video to think about what you uniquely                                 bring to both the web platform and the                                 Cova                                                                    things the first is someone to listen to                                 the second is something to learn and the                                 third is something to give and whatever                                 you do please stay inside and see thank                                 you so much
