	Why Contributing Seems Scary by Anne-Greeth van Herwijnen

Contributing to an open-source repository might seem scary for a lot of reasons. Maybe you just started with the framework, language or with software development in general. Maybe it is intimidating to try and jump into a project when others are already so invested and knowledgeable. However, contributing to Ember should be something that is accessible to everyone. In this talk I would like to tell my own story of how I became an Ember contributor. Drawing from scientific research, I will show how the community could make it easier for others to get involved.

          zone you're currently watching this live                               stream of eMERCOM                                                   and I'm going to tell you something                               today about contributing and why it may                               seem scary and to be honest this is                               quite scary recording this talk but I'm                                doing it anyway because I really want to                                share my excitement about the topic of                                contributing but first something more                                about me I started studying psychology                                here and ends today in                                               doing my psychology bachelor's degree                                and after that I completed my master's                                in human media interaction mostly                                focused on user centered design after                                that I started working at a company                                called native just half an hour drive                                from here where I started with a                                traineeship the goal of the traineeship                                was to become a software developer and                                that's what I am today I'm a rails                                developer doing a lot of CoffeeScript                                because we use a lot of server-side                                render templates currently we're moving                                towards something more modern using a                                JavaScript framework and the JavaScript                                framework is view a lot of you would                                have expected ember but that's not the                                case I'm not a number developer nor do I                                do any ember coding in my spare time but                                I ended up doing some contributing                                member and it all started in                                            was the Zoe on the left side of this                                ember logo and I ended up volunteering I                                ran around most of the time in a green                                shirt and during a few lunch breaks in a                                Zoe suit and I have to say running                                around in his OE suit has been the                                hardest contributing I've done so far if                                we fast-forward approximately                                          we end up in Brussels at FOSDEM FOSDEM                                is a large open-source conference with                                over                                             attending and over                                                      joined the open source design room                                because design was really something that                                I liked and thought that I could                                understand all the people there were                                really passionate about their                                contribution to open source and what I                                found out was that their contribution                                was not only not technical but it was                                valued so I decided I wanted to                                contribute to a framework that I knew                                with people that I thought could help me                                so two weeks later I opened my first                                pull request it was for ember and it was                                for the release blog and luckily I had                                some help this guy helped me a lot with                                my PR even though my PR is only four                                lines of code I was luckily able to copy                                and paste a lot from the RFC just                                copying this and these four lines of                                code they didn't make it any less                                valuable it ended up on the Ember map                                screencast of ember octane and after the                                encouragement I got from Kenneth but                                also other people that read the blog I                                decided to write more and since then                                I've been writing a lot of PRS for the                                Ember times next to writing I've also                                been adding a lot of so he symptoms                                Oersted website the cool thing is that                                this is not really hard it's just four                                or five lines of code but it shows to                                everybody who has a dumpster that their                                dumpster is value too if we forward to                                October I ended up at Mr Fest                                after contributing and volunteering at                                ember kampf two years in a row I decided                                to volunteer at ember fest but next to                                the volunteering I also gave a talk I                                gave a lightning talk about contributing                                and that everybody can contribute                                because                                after talking to somebody there who was                                surprised that I wrote for the ember                                times even though I'm not in a core team                                I don't do any amber development I                                realized that it's important that                                everybody realizes their value and what                                they can contribute to a framework like                                ever so let's talk about contributing                                contributing is something that we all                                see different so some of you might see                                contributing as adding and removing                                 lines of code from a repository others                                 of you who are like me might view it as                                 running around in a Zowie suit or                                 setting up a meet-up the cool thing is                                 there is a specification for this called                                 the all contributed spec which shows all                                 the different kinds of country butyl can                                 make to your repo story or your                                 framework so people who are giving a                                 talk even if they're currently recording                                 it somewhere they are contributing to                                 this but also the people who ask                                 questions on this cord lay eyes of                                 course a large huge contributor to ember                                 by making this all possible but there's                                 also a reason why people do this there                                 are psychological things that we can                                 look at and learn from when we want to                                 entice more people into contributing and                                 the first of it is motivation motivation                                 is really important in understanding why                                 people contribute social norms is                                 something we can use to get people to                                 contribute and the community which ember                                 has and is should be really proud of is                                 something that keeps people interested                                 income contributing so let's first look                                 at motivation there are two kinds of                                 motivation there is intrinsic and                                 extrinsic motivation intrinsic                                 motivation is something from within                                 wanting to help people comes from within                                 and is cool intrinsic motivation                                 experiencing                                 evasion might be that your boss wants a                                 bug fixed the cool thing is that it                                 doesn't really matter what kind of                                 motivation people have if they do                                 something from it then they end up with                                 a feeling of satisfaction and the                                 feeling of satisfaction is something we                                 as a community can enlargen if we give                                 gratitude to the people who contribute                                 if we acknowledge their contributions                                 they will feel this sense of                                 satisfaction and when they feel it they                                 will be more likely to contribute to                                 Ember the next thing is social norms                                 social norms is a psychological term                                 that we use to describe the situation                                 where somebody has some someone's                                 something and they say yes so for                                 example if Leia asks me to upload to                                 Zoe's & Tom search to the website and I                                 say yes that's social norms in effect                                 and the cool thing is that if somebody                                 asks you to do something you already                                 feel encouraged that that person chose                                 you so if we as a community invite                                 people this way to contribute they are                                 really likely to do it as well and the                                 cool thing is that they then experience                                 the community and community is really                                 important with an ember but also with in                                 the general sense of the society there                                 are two kinds of things we can look at                                 from a community standpoint and the                                 first of all is psychological sense of                                 community what this actually means is                                 that you feel aligned with a community                                 because their values match with yours                                 and I find some tweets that nicely                                 illustrate that so Scot tweeted that the                                 principles of the ember community are so                                 in line with basic human goodness and                                 that things like caring and teaching are                                 at the core of a lot of members of the                                 community                                 this really nicely illustrates                                 the sense of this psychological sense of                                 community and just this morning I found                                 this suite of John who was really sad                                 that he couldn't go to America but that                                 the fact that we're now able to share                                 this experience in a virtual world is so                                 cool this also shows his feeling of the                                 sense of community with the Emer                                 community and then just I think two                                 hours before I'm recording this I found                                 this tweet by Kenneth who's said that he                                 was going to open up more of his time to                                 help people to get contributing and he                                 wants to enlarge in psychological sense                                 of community for people who getting                                 started and the cool thing is it's not                                 only something that happens online by                                 organizing meetups like the Chennai made                                 up this hair or by taking a picture with                                 all the women at the last ember conf or                                 by attending ember Kampf last year in                                 person we get a feeling of this                                 psychological sense of community                                 community we get a feeling of the values                                 that we share with each other and even                                 today we have that feeling in a virtual                                 world there are a lot of people                                 currently watching this live stream                                 they're chatting there are people                                 watching it in VR and the cool thing is                                 that this psychological sense of                                 community that we're now experiencing                                 and I hope you're experiencing it with                                 me too can turn into community                                 commitment and the cool thing about                                 community commitment is that it's                                 something that make sure that people                                 keep contributing luckily a lot of ember                                 people tweet so I found another tweet to                                 show you this psychological concept                                 Melanie tweeted I'm switching to react                                 as an answer to the question what she                                 would tweet when she was kidnapped to                                 show us what happened and this shows so                                 no                                 that the identity that melanie has is so                                 closely linked to amber that we                                 immediately would recognize this and                                 this like community commitment has to do                                 with loyalty so people are willing to                                 exert effort on behalf of this community                                 people will share their experiences am i                                 sharing their experiences they make sure                                 that they're more likely to keep                                 contributing so the cool thing is that                                 if we as a community start talking to                                 each other and exposing it to the                                 outside world                                 we're as a community getting tighter so                                 what can we learn from what I told you                                 to say first of all make sure that you                                 thank everybody of course this is common                                 courtesy but be aware of all the people                                 that help you when you have an atom or                                 when you're organizing a meet-up                                 make sure that you're not only                                 acknowledging people who create PR but                                 also the people that help the PR take                                 more shape the next thing we as a                                 community to do is ask people to                                 contribute to their strengths asking                                 someone to contribute will hopefully                                 give them a cool sense that they can do                                 it but if you ask them to contribute to                                 their strengths they're even more likely                                 to feel really satisfied afterwards and                                 the last thing I want to encourage all                                 of you even if you're now sitting in                                 your sweatpants at home let's talk about                                 ember maybe not talk talk like somebody                                 in real life but make a blog or tweet                                 about it or fight the righteous fight at                                 the JavaScript reddit to make ember cool                                 there too                                 but by talking about ember you're                                 creating a better community commitment                                 for yourself but you're also able to ask                                 and invite people in to join ember so                                 this is something that I wanted to share                                 with you                                 want to tell you to do it it might seem                                 scary                                 you might feel really weird at first                                 talking to people about this thing                                 that's really important to you but do it                                 anyway it's not that hard you can start                                 by just creating a PR somewhere or just                                 writing a simple blog and as the                                 community grows we will be there for you                                 just like Kenneth was there for my first                                 PR there were a lot of people on this
