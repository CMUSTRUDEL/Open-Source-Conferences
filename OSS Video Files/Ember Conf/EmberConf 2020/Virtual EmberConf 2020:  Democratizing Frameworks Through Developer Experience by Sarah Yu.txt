Description: 
	Democratizing Frameworks Through Developer Experience by Sarah Yu

Improving the developer experience (DX) of frameworks is often something that is pushed aside for new features. The cost of not understanding how things work results in the misuse of frameworks, bugs and, most importantly, frustrated engineers.

This talk will explore the concept of DX through the lens of a former journalist. We will go over why having the lowest barrier to entry is important by democratizing development and providing access to information. We will also talk about the consequences of having subpar DX which creates an imbalance of power in the open source/developer ecosystem.
