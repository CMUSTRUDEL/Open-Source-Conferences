	Investing in Ember by Jessica Jordan

Less productivity, missed project deadlines and wasted money: thatâ€™s what you get for letting your developers work on open-source projects. Or do you really?

In this talk you will learn about the value that an investment in OSS provides to businesses on different levels. By example of organisations who benefit and give back to the open-source project Ember, you will see why paying your team to spend time on OSS might be the best business decision you will make this year.

matter if you're a software engineer a                               project manager it's he need or the                               founder of a company if you're                               interested in moving yourself forward                               professionally your team or your                               business                                this talk is exactly for you you will                                take a look at strategies we can employ                                to tap into the potential of open source                                and also to which extent doing so will                                actually benefit us and that's at least                                by the end of the talk you might                                actually realize that investing in ember                                is the best business decision you're                                gonna make this year but before we talk                                about investment and all the stuff let's                                talk about ember and what actually                                brings me here to talk about this                                several years ago when I was trying to                                take the next step in my learning                                journey as a back developer and it's                                front-end engineer I found that there                                was a very interesting concept I want to                                get more into which was all about                                building single page applications back                                then this was so kind of like a big new                                thing and I found ember to be quite                                promising in this regard because it had                                to slow in this idea that I was actually                                able to build large-scale and                                maintainable web applications using this                                framework and I found it really                                interesting and exciting for strong                                conventions that it had and having the                                feeling that I can build on top of the                                foundation of patterns and parody games                                that have been battle tested by a global                                community also the feeling that in yeah                                the user interface and develop                                experience was quite modern with the                                seal I which was still a very new thing                                back then I had the feeling to be very                                productive and could get my things kind                                of like out of the gate rather easily                                and also have the                                feeling that the framework actually                                developed itself and undertook some                                evolution throughout the years was also                                what waited worth staying for me and                                specifically in regards to looking at                                the recent embark chain release I think                                it is not an understatement to say ember                                is the modern framework unless but at                                least maybe one of the things that are                                found really intriguing when I just                                started learning ember was learn much                                more about open source and why was this                                so interesting to me why I was open                                source such a big deal I think just like                                with learning Umbra I really realized                                how much of a game changer this actually                                was the ability that that you as an                                engineer could actually go on to get up                                and really look into the source code or                                for example ember and then even if you                                even if you ran this kind of person                                would actually occur at the source code                                like from the top to the bottom                                like in just like looking at some of the                                bits of it it kind of made you feel that                                you can better understanding how it                                works under the hood and that maybe you                                could use some of these bits and pieces                                of knowledge to build better bett                                applications based on ember                                this was really big thing for me at                                least expect them and I think to this                                day it still is for a lot of suffering                                genius has this idea that if you use                                some source you have a lot of power and                                control and the knowledge what you                                actually build your applications and the                                other software on top off it's not only                                about the public source code is also                                about things like depending on the                                license that you can modify and                                redistribute the software and maybe try                                out ideas in the open-source community                                by doing so and also the fact that                                documentation tends to be ranked rather                                high quality because it is also openly                                developed with a group of peers from all                                across globe so on source on an                                individual software level software                                engineer level is actually quite a                                really nice thing when you appreciate it                                 but now let's take                                 like what does it actually mean in a                                 business context however like any                                 benefits are there any values for                                 businesses and companies to use all the                                 source I want to share some with you to                                 illustrate some of the ideas behind that                                 in a research paper by Fujairah carry                                 from                                                 open source in suffering the trenches                                 lessons from a large-scale OSS                                 implementation they had a look at the                                 deployment of saw strategy and a public                                 large-scale health sector organization                                 in Dublin Ireland the remote Hospital                                 and the case study they found a very                                 interesting incentive of the hospital to                                 implement open source in their own IT                                 infrastructure by the end of                                          management found themselves in a                                 budgetary shortfall                                                 quite a lot of money and they wanted to                                 find a way around that to actually solve                                 this problem one idea was to reiterate                                 the expenses on their T Department and I                                 can tell you from the research and                                 analysis that it did                                 the findings were actually quite                                 surprising so the took a look what they                                 can really spent and they found that                                 there were a couple of preparatory                                 commercial services that they were using                                 that kind of like cost a bit of money                                 and to get them working and to get the                                 infrastructure running so for example                                 for email services that paid one hundred                                 thousand euro or every single year to                                 maintain the infrastructure for around                                                                                                      this is not so much the interesting part                                 yet the interesting part is now to look                                 at a comparison that they did back then                                 with valuable solutions alternatives                                 from the old sauce wheel that they could                                 use instead of this property solutions                                 that are already used and spent so much                                 money for what the phone is actually                                 quite dramatic                                 they found that using all the source                                 software solutions similar to what they                                 want to achieve with the email services                                 they could possibly actually put the                                 expenses down                                                                                                     isn't it                                 and it doesn't enter here with emails                                 it's also about desktop apps content                                 management services and app servers that                                 will be using an IT infrastructure and                                 even here compared with open source                                 software based solutions they found a                                 potential saving saving potential of                                 over                                                                   respectively and also like the least                                 really big cost factor the hospital                                 imaging and because this is useful                                 Diagnostics and actually quite critical                                 for the business operation of a hospital                                 this is of course of a cost factor where                                 you cannot really kind of like try to                                 bring down the price you just like pay                                 as much as you need and this is also                                 maybe one of the reasons why this is                                 such a tremendous cost factor the IT                                 department there's almost                                             euro every single year it has been quite                                 a contributing factor to the budgetary                                 problems that the organization faced and                                 even here in this very specific example                                 x-ray digital imaging technology you can                                 imagine how small the community is it                                 actually tries to disappear software                                 anthers even there they could actually                                 find almost Essbase components that                                 would help them to make savings and also                                 here the same potentials quadratic                                 they've found using open source they                                 might actually have another potential                                 for savings of over four point one five                                 million all of this costs and savings                                 actually add up so they calculated that                                 for the first year of implementation of                                 own source of resolutions they might                                 have a saving potential of twelve point                                 seven five million euro and or five                                 years calculating all the maintenance                                 cost renewing subscriptions for                                 commercial services they also found that                                 here they had an immense saving                                 potential of eight point one seven                                 billion euro and just to give you an                                 idea of what eight point one seven                                 million euro means because and this I                                 personally after                                                        understand what this number means                                 anymore for an organization and                                 Dublin Ireland the swings that means                                 paying the average salary of                                            scientists or a group of                                                 group of                                                            years so quite a lot of money and also                                 shall see how real aberration opensource                                 actually was these solutions that the                                 organized organisation could actually                                 choose to overcome the budget problem                                 and this idea that we can in the                                 business context use of us also                                 infrastructure offer products that we                                 build on top of this is what we called                                 open source exhibition acquiring open                                 source and then oftentimes this was                                 results on a lot of flag benefits which                                 includes the saving money maybe the most                                 obvious potential that we get from using                                 open source in a business but not the                                 single one actually to illustrate this I                                 want to share a quote with you but                                 resembling the executed director of the                                 Nieman Foundation who also shared why he                                 thinks businesses really catch on to                                 this idea to use open source he for                                 example said shared development is an                                 aiding faster development with higher                                 quality lower costs this is causing the                                 software value chain to change the idea                                 is that it's not only about being                                 concerned about like your finances when                                 you use an open source it's also about                                 trying to create faster development                                 cycles for products that are based on                                 the source and making sure that by share                                 with the moment in outside of                                 organization the quality has to be                                 higher because more people are actually                                 trying to figure out what are the best                                 solution for not only your specific use                                 case but for a lot of people's different                                 use cases and this in admittedly                                 actually makes the products better that                                 they could ever have been but just                                 developing them internally in a single                                 organization so this quality idea behind                                 improving products is what makes all                                 source acquisition also so attractive to                                 a lot of businesses and what you also                                 mentioned that this is causing the                                 software value chain to change and salsa                                 luminaries this                                 far-distant utopian future but actually                                 it is not a secret probably already                                 imagined as well from your own teams and                                 because in                                                                                                                                 actually based on open-source software                                 components and if we estimate that this                                 development actually continued up until                                                                      we can also imagine that nowadays it is                                 safe to say that every single business                                 every kind of like operating                                 organization is actually based on                                 open-source and it's using one source                                 for its own benefit this idea of open                                 source acquisition so it's kind of like                                 rather common and Quine of like well                                 understood but what if I told you that                                 this is not even trying to fully embrace                                 the potential of what open source could                                 do to businesses what if I told you this                                 is just the tip of the iceberg and that                                 the full potential of open source is not                                 even kind of like who touched yet I've                                 talked about yet when we talk about                                 better products and trying to save money                                 by using open source so now you wonder                                 what is this underbelly of this iceberg                                 what is this untapped potential we would                                 take a look at this in just a bit                                 but let's first of all take a look at an                                 interesting interview series we did at                                 the Ember Times newsletter which if you                                 haven't subscribed it you should totally                                 do that just right now go to get bits                                 and gets a subscription going Jonah's                                 awesome support and more times on the                                 discord okay this is really the end of                                 of the pitch but anyways we did it we                                 series and we tried to talk with                                 different community members about their                                 motivations and also the interest to                                 contribute to ember and be part of the                                 group we also talked with Geneva who's                                 an ember core learning team member and                                 buffering framework or team member who                                 also gave this excellent keynote just                                 earlier here back on and who talked with                                 us also about her intrinsic motivations                                 to contribute to memory and she said                                 that contributed to ember is really fun                                 I started by writing but the chance to                                 learn from others was what really made                                 of Mustang the things that I've learned                                 from other people participating here                                 help me my job every day and not just on                                 the cold front even on the team dynamic                                 level leadership strategies and best                                 practices many of the things that she                                 talks about data don't have anything to                                 do with the fact that she is trying to                                 use a thesaurus so she can save money                                 it's about a whole other sphere of how                                 we can leverage open source and                                 businesses this is not only about                                 acquiring it it's also about integrating                                 open source in a more holistic way and                                 trying to find other ways to interact                                 with it the sub process of giving back                                 to projects to contribute it and see                                 which kind of benefits you can get for                                 it is what we call open source                                 integration and this is also something                                 that's actually valid relevant for this                                 but sometimes not as well understood as                                 obsession because there many different                                 levels of open-source integration can                                 have business and organizations both on                                 the team individual and also on the                                 whole scale large-scale business one                                 example that we can think of by                                 listening to the interview just valium                                 was whoops one moment please                                 here we go sorry about that one thing                                 that we thought about when we think                                 about OSS integration is the fact that                                 engineers who actually contribute to                                 open source have another and very                                 significant way to prove their own                                 skills in many different areas be                                 technical skills learning a new                                 programming language kinda like more                                 intimate knowledge of libraries or                                 frameworks that they're using won't                                 forget organizational skills trying to                                 lead initiatives in the community for                                 example of writing our C's or trying to                                 lead the efforts for example redesign of                                 a website to bring them to life and to                                 bring back these kind of skills that                                 have been honed in remote collaboration                                 with peers all around the world into                                 your own organization where they can                                 also be very beneficial it's all about                                 thinking of an awful way to try to                                 provide for the room and the space for                                 engineers who are already working on it                                 teams to nurture their own excellence                                 that they already have and to really                                 fulfill the new full potential and last                                 but not least also if you think about it                                 from this way what does it actually mean                                 if an engineer can really work on                                 something that they share values with                                 what if engineer really feels that                                 having a real impact not only on a                                 product that is developed internally but                                 on something that is used by                                 organizations all around the world and                                 that can have like real promoted use                                 case and be a real solution out there is                                 something that the value value and can                                 give them also another sense of                                 fulfillment that might even exceed their                                 fulfillment in the day to day job if we                                 think about this way we can also think                                 about that this is some nourishment we                                 can provide to teams to engineers and to                                 our business by providing the sense of                                 fulfillment and work satisfaction and of                                 course this is not the end of the story                                 oftentimes if you often hiring processes                                 at all you find yourself in the                                 situation where you want to grow your                                 team another time and                                 and you say to yourself and you have                                 like a job and out there that says                                 something along the lines of that you're                                 looking for C no JavaScript engineer                                 that should have at least at five years                                 experience with ember maybe this should                                 be driven motivated self-starter I have                                 a can-do attitude the list goes on and                                 on and on and and at the end of the day                                 she might actually find a lot of like                                 red coming outside when you fit this                                 profile really nicely and you're already                                 doing a great job to get all of these                                 great people potentially getting onto                                 your team and creating great work but                                 then at one kind of like blocker which                                 is all about them also comes like                                 interviewing with a lot of other places                                 and then realizing I am extra not fully                                 confident yet if I should really go with                                 company X I'm not company Y and if you                                 are company X you come from like now                                 realize yeah this is actually quite                                 frustrating to spend a lot of like time                                 and money into hiring processes and                                 sometimes it really just doesn't work                                 out because the demand for skilled                                 workers knowledge workers is really high                                 and it's actually not so clear yet how                                 to get this competitive edge at the very                                 end of and telling process - yeah get                                 people to really confident say I want to                                 be here and what if I now told you that                                 even this very specific aspect of your                                 business                                 um sauce can actually play a crucial                                 role what if I told you that an open                                 source integrator talent strategy is                                 something that actually can give you                                 this competitive edge that you're                                 looking for the second low caliber could                                 actually play out so imagine you                                 actually accept the fact that this could                                 be the key to your talent strategy                                 success and he implemented almost all                                 strategy we will take a look later on                                 how this could look like in practice                                 just assume this for now what you might                                 find is that especially and these people                                 who already contribute your sauce that                                 find a lot of fact value and contributed                                 it in their paid work time after your                                 company got an increased sense of a film                                 satisfaction because it can actually                                 adhere through the own interest rather                                 easily by choosing Freedy Baraka no                                 sauce product what you might find out of                                 this as well that turns retainment is a                                 bit easier to do in your company as well                                 just because work satisfaction increase                                 and what do you get out of this as well                                 might be that especially if you're                                 engineers are really involved in all the                                 source communities that they reach out                                 to other engineers rather automatically                                 by working on any kind of projects and                                 that this kind of network that they're                                 creating and it's also something that                                 can later on help you in the turn                                 acquisition process by being able to                                 actually proactively reach out to other                                 skilled engineers that already have the                                 skillset that you are looking for by                                 being involved in the same or sauce                                 community as you are engineers are                                 already in you actually have the chance                                 to provide opportunities to people who                                 may be looking for the next career steps                                 months or years from now and thinking                                 about these five key steps of your test                                 but a giant our place in it all sauce is                                 something that you could also keep in                                 mind and might being kind of like the                                 convincing factor for your already but                                 even after this even after kind of like                                 highlighting how attracting talent                                 retain so it might be something that's                                 really great for you and helpful source                                 can play a role you might so kind of                                 like think to yourself well like                                 honestly sounds already great in theory                                 but like a practice how does this really                                 work there's more company mutable of                                 deadlines we've worked in a very                                 fast-paced environment you don't have                                 the time and the money to actually do                                 one of this just like another thing that                                 actually distracts us from our core                                 business and honestly I believe you                                 actually have the best idea of what is                                 best for your business because you                                 actually part of it and you know how it                                 actually works and what restrictions you                                 have to deal with on a day to day basis                                 so this part of the talk is not all                                 about trying to convince you what is                                 right or wrong it's more about giving                                 your ideas what you could employ and                                 what you create                                 leave out depending on what you really                                 need and maybe there's something                                 that I'll show you right now in an                                 example of how source could look like in                                 practice that available for you maybe                                 they're not but just keep an old mind                                 and see if there's something that you                                 could take away from when we talk about                                 home source can look like in action and                                 practice by the examples of different                                 strategies in real-life businesses as                                 this example I want to highlight one                                 strategy at a company that I know quite                                 well because I worked there for almost                                 four years which is simple at                                 consultancy based and you make we also                                 very involved in the EMA community and                                 here for example we also really value to                                 find a way to integrate open source into                                 our actual work and not have it only                                 just like a side asset and here we try                                 to leverage the                                                    you're not familiar with it it's the                                 idea that you have like one day per week                                 so                                                                      for working on source code contributions                                 preparation of conference talks writing                                 book pose or be it also organizing                                 community events and for the rest of the                                 time you actually work on your core                                 business for example in our case working                                 on client projects the great thing is                                 about this as well how we try to do it                                 with the                                                              that well rebalance it we can also give                                 equal opportunity of this time to                                 everyone so every engineer every                                 designer can actually leverage it and                                 work on their own interesting projects                                 that they find last but least we also                                 want to make sure that they actually get                                 tangible outcomes                                                       outcomes should be shared either with                                 the team or with our community and I                                 think it's it's an understatement to say                                 that the                                                                 on open source that simple apps had                                 significant impact I think it is maybe                                 one of the outstanding factors of our                                 company so far to be able to have a lot                                 of like great projects out there that                                 actually hallmarks of our work in the                                 community including over a dozen                                 javascript rules for example and that                                 simple off ok                                 who help developers all around the world                                 in their day to day businesses to create                                 great direct applications and yeah maybe                                 you also see from this that these                                 benefits are real and this is also                                 something you could consider for your                                 own business but not for at least at the                                 end of the day if you think about                                 investing if you think about investing                                 open source or like an ember you still                                 have to figure out how will you actually                                 do it because depending on how he                                 invested it will actually be a real                                 success or I might be more of a very                                 expensive investment that you don't get                                 so many retransform so how will you know                                 how much earnest yeah first of all I                                 understand what your businesses are                                 trying to Tina and cater to them and                                 thinking about areas that you want to                                 improve would be a product development                                 or training or branding you might want                                 to employ different strategies either                                 with short mid term or long term returns                                 so let's take a look at some very                                 specific examples of needs that you want                                 to meet in your business so you can                                 actually choose the right strategy for                                 the specific need when you try to                                 develop an OSS integrated strategy ed                                 your business so for example you had the                                 need to fix a product did you actually                                 know that sometimes when the engineer                                 actually stumbles upon like a bug fix                                 that you pay them to fix so your product                                 can be sold to your customers again it's                                 sometimes not only about trying to                                 market patch this bug in the actual                                 application code sometimes it's a back                                 that actually originates with our party                                 library or it's just because a                                 third-party library doesn't have a                                 feature yet that could actually be                                 available and would help you to fix the                                 backend application and in this specific                                 case for example it's actually rather                                 easy for the engineer to say well I'm                                 not gonna ranking patches and I I'm                                 actually gonna provide an app screen bug                                 fix so a bug fix and actually fix this                                 the third-party library and in turn will                                 automatically fix your application with                                 the next                                 memory and and they are actually able to                                 work on this without any kind of like                                 extra money or effort expended from his                                 side and this has really great thoughts                                 of offering product a level of course                                 because you just want to fix it backs                                 and this is what you want in the first                                 place but also it's great training                                 opportunity for any developers working                                 on this because they actually get a seed                                 other great insights into the libraries                                 that they're using and this knowledge                                 might be beneficial weeks or months or                                 so something to keep in mind if you just                                 want to have like some kind of a                                 short-term open source integration wins                                 you can for example us engineers to try                                 to do it upstream back fixes wherever                                 possible if you're really looking                                 forward to improve the quality of your                                 products there are also different ways                                 just meant he had like an internal                                 library of functionality that you could                                 rather easily external eyes and actually                                 make an open-source add-on source                                 project and all kinds of people from all                                 around other organizations could                                 actually help you to improve it the                                 great thing is once they actually share                                 the development that's usually much much                                 easier to kind of like identify use                                 cases that are very interesting for the                                 functionality or the project that you're                                 sourcing that you haven't been aware of                                 before and to also help you identify it                                 fixed box and fix so much quicker than                                 if he would have continued with the                                 development autonomy so if you go with                                 this route for example you realize okay                                 it's actually quite a little bit                                 investment to kind of like get something                                 which American ass so it can be non                                 source project we have to invest a                                 little of engineering time to do that                                 but once we've done this is actually                                 like I'm very grateful time for us on                                 the product development side and not                                 spill at least also on the branding side                                 are the engineers are the organization I                                 use in your own sauce product you name                                 us gonna be out there for engineering                                 teams and this is really great for your                                 kind of                                 marketing strategy here as well so great                                 wins in the mid and the mantra in las                                 colonies especially for like a small                                 mid-sized oh and you as a company can                                 only grow with the help and support from                                 others and this is what you want to                                 nourish as good as possible and if you                                 imagine armed conflict has this point of                                 view of tech user groups actually really                                 fulfilling the need then this is                                 something you should definitely look                                 into just imagine you had like a own                                 local user group for my developers in                                 your town or maybe you sponsor a whole                                 statement from an already existing user                                 group every now and then the effects                                 that you have a manifold first of all                                 you have a opportunity to Co network                                 with a lot of other engineers                                 organization around your area that are                                 also using the same technologies issuers                                 and also if you get an added benefit of                                 branding because when you fix them a                                 sponsor when you for example house                                 people will remember your name this is                                 something that can pay off already weeks                                 months sometimes years from now so here                                 also great benefits that you get in the                                 long term both on the branding and the                                 turn strategies side and which should                                 also note the underestimated especially                                 follow telling strategy where you know                                 as a tech company might send us take                                 quite a long time to hire someone so why                                 not invest today and then get the                                 benefits from it a couple months or yes                                 or no so something to come and support                                 your local Emma meetup and that many                                 different ways that companies contribute                                 to open source right now so if you for                                 example like a smaller company you might                                 kind of try to tend to do more short                                 term investments for example these                                 upstream bug fixes that are talked about                                 or trying to collaborate an open source                                 projects that you're already using                                 because it's rather easy to invest and                                 stop the investment and go from there                                 but especially if you're like a large                                 organization maybe like more than ten                                 thousand                                 members then you might realize that for                                 example every stakeholder ship positions                                 and projects trying to help on source                                 projects to put the roadmap and to pace                                 them through it with the features that                                 are relevant for your own business                                 product is something that you would                                 really value and you know to give you                                 some confident as well if you maybe                                 already there to to make the choice that                                 you know okay maybe I should look into                                 all the source and how we can deploy                                 this in our business I want to show you                                 in great company especially in the EMA                                 community which is a framework or                                 project that is not backed by one single                                 big company but a lot of like different                                 companies and organization and                                 individual contributors that come                                 together to check the product you are in                                 yeah as I said very great company and                                 looking at a lot of like small mid and                                 larger sized companies he might also                                 find very similar strategy said you can                                 adapt for your own business and yeah was                                 this I think you have like a better                                 understanding how this could actually                                 play out and the higher quality products                                 more secure products but also more                                 effective and excellent teams as well as                                 the competitive app that you get in                                 sales and also your talent strategy by                                 employing um source and your business                                 are the things that actually gives us x                                 z impact that is larger than just the                                 sum of its parts and yeah i think you                                 had a great time so it kind of like get                                 a little bit like for insight together                                 with me into open source and what it                                 means in the my ecosystem specifically                                 and maybe at this point my yappin a                                 little bit and actually come to the                                 conclusion that you can now actually                                 make really great business for this                                 business decision for                                 so maybe even the best by investing in                                 ember and with this I would like to
