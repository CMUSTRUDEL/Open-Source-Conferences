	Ben Demboski: "Embroider: from zero to route splitting in 3.5 weeks"

Embroider from zero to route splitting in 3.5 weeks. So a couple of months ago now I went through an effort of porting our app over to to embroider, took about three and a half weeks to, do the full thing. And I wrote up an article on it afterwards, and most of this talk is kind of adapted from that article.
So I'm gonna move relatively quickly through the kind of slides and the meat of the information to leave time for for questions because, you know, I could, could've just brought up my article and read it to you all, but that doesn't seem like the most interesting use of time here.
