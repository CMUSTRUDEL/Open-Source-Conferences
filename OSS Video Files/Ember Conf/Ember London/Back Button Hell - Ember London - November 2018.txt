Description: 
	Presented by Dexter Edwards.

Working on a mobile first Ember application we are often required to implement native-like patterns. In particular we needed to implement a navigation stack and provide the user with the ability to go back, it was... an experience. However some interesting things were learnt on the way that I hope you find useful.

We're bringing the meetup to you. With Sessions, you can watch recordings of top-notch talks from developer meetups -- wherever and whenever you want.

Meetups are a great way to learn from our peers and to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. As developers ourselves, we at Pusher wanted to bring this great content to more people... So we built Sessions. On Sessions, you can watch talks that interest you and subscribe to be notified when new content gets added.
