hello thank you all for coming so I've

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,339
some of you I've spoken to already I'm

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,370
Nikki I work at a company called future

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,599
learn an online social learning platform

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,580
I'm currently a technical manager there

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,900
but before I did that job I was a web

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,389
developer for a long long time

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,039
like decades and I'm definitely on the

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:20,340
developer end of the kind of designer

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,050
developer spectrum I'm not very good at

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,340
design I have a lovely deck from my

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,439
company which is why you all are not

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,599
going to be shuddering and horror at the

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,160
slides so I can't do these things on my

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,130
own I have to work with designers to

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,090
ship the products that we build together

00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,680
so I've got a real interesting I'm

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,180
developed this interest over the years

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,440
of like making sure that developers and

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,059
designers can kind of work a bit closer

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,360
together and communicate a bit better

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,770
and hopefully this talk is about some

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,780
cool ways that you can take away and do

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,340
this so I want to talk about developers

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,649
and designers who want to kind of push

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,879
their imaginations to the limit push the

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,530
web to the limit and I'm going to talk

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,390
about why some of the things that we've

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,160
been doing over the past few years I'm

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,170
not so perfect anymore and we can kind

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,780
of move a bit beyond that there's a way

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,239
to move on so this is what going to

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,030
cover I realized this is kind of a bold

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,400
statement web design is getting boring

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,960
hashtag not all websites sorry

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,150
the ember London website is lovely by

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,950
the way very good well done some

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,409
practical sort of takes away takeaways

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,460
and some find all sort of things I

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,390
stumbled on while I was doing some of

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,689
this work that you might want to look

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,280
out for so why are grids so great anyway

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,229
they work really well for lots of

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,960
reasons we've all been using them and

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:30,750
building them over years decades some of

00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:36,119
us from tables to floats to flexbox and

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:39,979
CSS grid now I'm sorry and for many many

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,360
more years offline so why do we do it

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:45,000
well to answer that question we need to

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,930
go way back this is the Pyramid Texts

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,460
and it's from 2300 BC so like several

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,530
thousand years old it's kind of blows my

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,450
mind that we can even see something like

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,280
this that is that old and this kind of

00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,780
the first example of human writing that

00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,000
we have people trying to kind of

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,040
communicate with each other but I would

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,680
like you to note that I think this is a

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,210
one column layout right it's slightly

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,179
weird because it's like top to bottom

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,290
but it's all one column so a little bit

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,540
later five six eight ad beautiful it's

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,860
like

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,360
stunning again and this also blows my

00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,430
mind that we have access to this kind of

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,590
you know early example of human

00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:23,349
communication this is the Birmingham

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,700
Khurram manuscript and again you can see

00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:31,659
like there's two pages but it's all

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:34,239
still one column so finally 808 ad 3,000

00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:36,700
years I think maybe more after chipping

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,310
away at that stone we finally get to a

00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,139
two column layout so there's this is a

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,639
sort of marginalia the text that people

00:02:41,139 --> 00:02:44,349
would write in the color in the side

00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,359
column that was left empty of the book

00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,950
that was printed and finally you can

00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:50,799
start to see the benefit of a grid

00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,139
layout because this is sort of

00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:55,090
supporting information and related

00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:59,409
concepts that can be sort of attached to

00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:02,169
pieces of the text in the early 20th

00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:04,090
century the grid movement art sort of

00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:06,069
movement exploded and the grid system

00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,139
was finally kind of named I don't think

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,819
it really had a name before this and it

00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:11,349
starts to look a lot more similar to the

00:03:09,819 --> 00:03:14,799
kind of component systems that we're all

00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:18,099
used to using much more today Massimo

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,590
Vignelli decided designed the Uni grid

00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,849
in the think the 1970s for that exact

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,430
reason to kind of make the work more

00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:25,900
modular make it more reusable it would

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,260
have consistency it would be a lot

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,760
easier to create and this still helps

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,849
the National Park cartographers today

00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,409
who used this system they used the uni

00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:37,090
grid to make the layouts more readable

00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:39,359
and the other thing I really like about

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,260
these is that they look really good

00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:44,199
apart from having a kind of aesthetic

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,699
benefit there it helps balance the pages

00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:48,340
so that one element is not overpowering

00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:50,739
the other and it keeps things more

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,780
balanced it also has a practical benefit

00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,340
because it helps people sort of staying

00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,530
a bit more engaged with the content and

00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,180
read it a bit more and stay safe and

00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,370
enjoy the park that is the reason

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,280
they're there but there are some really

00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,109
bad examples of using grid as well like

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,269
this which one of the two possible

00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:10,599
websites and this tweet is from two

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:12,639
years ago and I've got to be honest I

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:15,519
don't see a huge amount of change this

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:17,889
is super snarky I know we but you can

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,449
take it a little bit too far I'm not

00:04:17,889 --> 00:04:21,009
knocking it like the reason we do this

00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:22,960
kind of stuff is because it works on a

00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:25,180
lot of levels right it's easy to do it's

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,650
easy to reproduce it's modular if you

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,870
use the Uni grid it makes everything

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,860
easy to you know look really good me

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:34,120
more useful but it's really boring you

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,770
look at this and you can sort of see the

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,660
clues in the name it's called the CSS

00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,060
box model it makes boxes you can have

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,050
the margin on the inside or the outside

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,479
but you know they're all kind of the

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,280
same shape design is this discipline

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,690
with this really rich history and it

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,300
would be a shame if we didn't make more

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,460
use of it and things like this are a

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,500
problem so it's really good that like

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:55,509
Squarespace is available so that people

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,190
can you know have a really good

00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:58,810
communication and really good tools and

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:01,419
make it easier for so many more people

00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,530
to do stuff but again I think we're

00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:04,150
missing something if it's like it's all

00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,919
coming out looking the same the benefits

00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,449
of that rich history of thought from

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,600
those sort of people chipping away on

00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:11,650
that stone have been lost and you run

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,150
the risk of not getting your message

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:15,250
across as effectively as you could

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,870
so like the only reason I'm even giving

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,729
this talk let the spark of the idea of

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,740
it was through conversations with

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,020
designers at work and with friends and

00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,639
they say hey we've got this books Nicky

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,690
you like what can you do to make it look

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,610
more interesting and make it stand out

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,220
and for the last 10 years all I've been

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,650
able to say is some around the corners

00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,680
on it like you know it's not very

00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:37,120
satisfying for me or for them the only

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,490
reason we even have the ability to do

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,410
this kind of stuff in CSS is because

00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,690
designers got frustrated with like the

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,830
netscape mosaic text layout and they

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,030
want fonts a little colors and they want

00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,520
to make stuff more interesting and get

00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:50,289
their message across more effectively so

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,960
let's think a bit bigger doesn't have to

00:05:50,289 --> 00:05:54,340
be just rounded corners and i'm not the

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,260
only one thinking this this is gem

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,500
simmons she's a designer and developer

00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,330
advocate at mozilla and she's really

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,770
pushing this idea that there are a

00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,270
graphic design tools and graphic design

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,500
thought that we can bring to the web and

00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,860
make things so much more interesting

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,710
than they currently are right now this

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,880
was a list of parts sort of webinar i

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,099
hate that word but i think that's what

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,919
it was i watched it so you don't have to

00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:19,750
you we're copying each other's work too

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,669
much too many things look like medium to

00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:25,389
many things like web design out of 2007

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:28,539
everybody's bored so this way there is a

00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:29,889
way to make design better on the web and

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:31,870
once i started thinking about this I

00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:34,510
could see everywhere I found all these

00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,520
examples of graphic design that's just

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,680
like print design really interesting

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,090
really striking art direction really

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,770
kind of engages you with the

00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:44,710
makes you want to read it and carry on

00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,900
with it more these were all from one

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,360
issue of the Evening Standard somebody

00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,530
there really likes this kind of style

00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,479
and the point of all these examples is

00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,530
like we can do this stuff in print and I

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,210
think for a long time we've had this

00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,199
kind of separation of print and web and

00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,699
we don't want to be too much like the

00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:58,780
other but actually there are things that

00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:01,840
we can learn from it and are things that

00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,880
we can draw together so if we did want

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,030
to do stuff like this and we didn't have

00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:09,250
CSS shapes how would we do it how have

00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,380
we done it in the past super old-school

00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,910
just chuck it all in an image it's not

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,190
very accessible it's not very scalable

00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,200
it's not very responsive I think a lot

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,100
of web comics are still made like this

00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,650
which i think is a real shame because

00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,350
that's sort of design and discipline

00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,310
that would be open to a lot more people

00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,660
if you didn't want to put everything

00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,770
just in an image you could do it with

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,660
JavaScript you kind of like put

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,380
everything in its own element and you

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,669
know position everything manually not

00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,479
very scalable performant there's

00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:37,660
probably other ways that you can think

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:41,350
of there aren't great too so that's kind

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,789
of a current state of the art so let's

00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,830
get away from these boring rectangles

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,960
we're stuck in our old ways we can do

00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:48,010
something a bit more interesting once

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,990
you understand the rules and you

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,100
understand why grids exist and they'll

00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,240
make things look really good and you can

00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,710
do the white balance and all of that

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,620
stuff like we've got the tools to kind

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:57,520
of break out of it now so let's use this

00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,250
one neat trick

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,979
CSS shapes that was the history now

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,880
we're looking for it so the first thing

00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,180
I want to talk to you about shape

00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,270
outside it has these values hopefully

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,889
this is like sensibly named but shape

00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,630
outside applied to an element makes the

00:08:11,889 --> 00:08:16,180
text flow around the element in the

00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,260
shape that you've chosen we're just

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,210
going to be covering the top three

00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,280
values today because as far as I can

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:24,700
tell inset doesn't do anything that

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,080
floats conte I'm an ellipse my designer

00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,310
friends at work tell me this is not true

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,900
but I think it's the same as a circle so

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,539
so shape outside circle I've got to warn

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:37,089
you these are very 1co properties they

00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,039
sort of do what they say on the tin this

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,349
aligns text around a circle and this is

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,550
so easy to do this is what I've kind of

00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:43,870
get quite frustrated about when I don't

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,770
understand why people don't do it more

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:51,820
often this is a really simple example

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,959
just a circle with a red dot layout you

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,710
could do that however you wanted I've

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,380
uses the border

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:58,480
radius and if you add this one line you

00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:01,000
get this nice sort of curving text flow

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,560
it's the only thing you need to add if

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,940
you don't have shape outside support

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,470
then you just get your standard fullback

00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:08,160
that you would have had anyway so like

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,899
one liner why not right

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,540
next up polygons so the simplest example

00:09:10,899 --> 00:09:15,010
of a polygon is a triangle this is what

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,020
that might look like it's a really

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,410
simple example I've done it with borders

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,510
and again it's just this one liner so

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,920
the dot dot there indicates that okay

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,350
it's getting like slightly more

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,660
complicated now and you actually have to

00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,940
set the points that you want to use you

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:32,830
can do that in pixels percentage REMS

00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,670
whatever you like but it's a lot of

00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,779
getting a little bit more complicated

00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,660
you have to sort of think about what

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:39,700
you're doing just as with the circle if

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,290
shape outside is not supported you just

00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,240
get your standard rectangle that you

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,560
know people in the olden days would have

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:50,620
got this is another example of a polygon

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,779
this is just a square rectangle with the

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,570
corner cut off this is what it looks

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:58,480
like and again you can see like you have

00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,560
to kind of go in and set these points so

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,250
it starting to look a little bit more

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,450
complicated against like this is a bit

00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,560
more work like how do I keep these

00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,529
numbers straight in my head where do

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,830
they start from you know and it gets

00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,010
worse

00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:16,029
right polygons can have infinite points

00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:18,550
I guess this is really cool I love this

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,140
layout but that declaration is starting

00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:23,529
to look a bit horrendous and it goes on

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,540
for like pages down here so this is

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,060
starting to look like it looks good but

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,410
it's a bit of a pain in the arse it's a

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,730
bit of a barrier to entry and if I have

00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,150
to do all this work then I might not

00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,890
bother I might not think it's worth it

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,600
so we're very lucky that we have a bunch

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,920
of people like Jen Simmons who have been

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,660
doing a whole bunch of good work and her

00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:43,300
team to make this kind of stuff a lot

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,640
easier for us so the first thing I want

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:48,779
to show you I think this will work this

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,420
is a video so this is Firefox nightly

00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:55,540
and it's a video of their new shape

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,310
editor so I've downloaded the browser

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,770
I've got my dev tools open and I'm going

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,660
to just inspect the element that has the

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,220
shape applied I usually people can't see

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,850
this because it's so tiny but there's a

00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:08,600
tiny little icon down here

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:10,250
you click on it in the rule editor then

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,000
you get these points like this blew my

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,430
mind again like watch what happens

00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,600
you can drag them around this is like

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:22,190
look mom I'm a designer this is so cool

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,180
this is absolutely amazing and the other

00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:25,730
thing I really like about this is the

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,139
valleys are changing here so you can

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,000
just copy and paste them in like you can

00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:32,089
sit with your designer and like they can

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,360
do it you know amazing you'd have to do

00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:37,880
less work which is always a good thing

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,420
and these tools as well I think just

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:43,250
landed in Firefox 62 like this week so I

00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,339
don't know mines coming out but it's

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,660
there so yeah this was really amazing I

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,220
was very pleased when I heard of out

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,720
about this and it's not just shapes as

00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,279
well that you can edit in here there's a

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,329
whole bunch of other stuff like grid and

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:57,920
various other editors so right now you

00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,800
have to download Firefox nightly to get

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,389
that if you don't want to do that

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,279
there's too much work I'm trying to make

00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,620
this like as less effort as possible for

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,029
you you can get this extension for

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,630
Chrome and it works in kind of pretty

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:15,230
much the same way so that's everything

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:17,569
about polygons and even with these tools

00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:19,189
you might find that this is like still a

00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:20,720
bit of extra work that you don't want to

00:12:19,189 --> 00:12:22,009
do or maybe you're a designer is busy

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,740
and you can't find the time to kind of

00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,970
sit down together and sort of play with

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,610
things you know on a pixel-by-pixel

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,110
basis so there's one last value for

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,089
shape outside that I want to talk to you

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,560
about which is again this just

00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:37,939
completely blew my mind when I found out

00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:40,459
about it so we're going to have the same

00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:41,810
sort of art direction and the same sort

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,670
of effect we're going to curve this text

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,839
around it like a weird shape but we're

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:47,990
not going to do this with like very

00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,420
little code at all are you think this is

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,930
actually magic as far as my lips as

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:56,120
actually magic as far as I can tell it

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,399
uses the Alpha channel of the image how

00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,410
cool is that

00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:04,819
yeah it's incredibly clever so it needs

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:07,160
a transparent PNG obviously or an SVG so

00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:09,980
the new sort of value there is this

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,889
image like URL to your image and the

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,829
shape image threshold threshold which I

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:17,839
want to get this right so not 0.5 there

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,560
means all the pixels that are more than

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,629
50%

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,019
parent will be sort of attacked by this

00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:25,879
shape vector and the reason I was so

00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:27,529
excited to come across this is that I

00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,589
think this was a much more valuable use

00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:33,170
case than like drawing lines and shapes

00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:34,519
and what have you the likelihood is that

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,839
you're going to be aligning text around

00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:37,009
an image and their likelihood is that if

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,209
you have to do that then your designer

00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:39,620
has already done the work they've opened

00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,269
up the image and they prepared it and

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,259
they've made it look really good so you

00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:46,720
may as well just kind of let the browser

00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:49,180
do the work for you in that case so

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,550
that's all I have to share about CSS

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,899
shapes let's have a look at more my next

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,819
thought was browser support like how

00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:57,559
real is this how can I use it somebody's

00:13:55,819 --> 00:14:00,709
already asked me today did I check this

00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:03,649
in ie 11 yes I did and I'm gonna tell

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:06,410
you exactly how to deal with it so this

00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:08,059
is kind of used for CSS shapes this

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,399
Firefox is kind of just poking its nose

00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:13,129
in there Opera Mini I don't know what

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:16,459
they're doing they never anything it's

00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:18,249
never gonna be in ie 11 sorry but we'll

00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,629
deal with that later

00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:22,610
yes just coming into Firefox it's under

00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:23,629
consideration in edge I don't really

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,309
know what that means does anyone know

00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:28,309
what that means it means they might or

00:14:25,309 --> 00:14:29,509
they might not depending on yeah but you

00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:32,629
can see like this stuff has been around

00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:33,980
for a long long time and I'm really

00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:35,480
interested in like why people aren't

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:40,550
using it very much if it's been around

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,930
for so long yeah so say we have to be

00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:44,839
somewhat careful when we're using it

00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,949
with older browsers but the nice thing

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:47,059
about it is that it has this kind of

00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:48,949
natural fallback like this is what

00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:51,259
people are used to this is what people

00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:53,779
see all over the web every day if that's

00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:55,550
all they see then no biggie right if

00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:58,660
they have the support they will get the

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:02,269
the nice circle or the nice alignments

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,759
so that's CSS shapes it has a CSS shapes

00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,470
has a kind of natural companion in this

00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:07,730
sort of work if you would like doing art

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:08,899
direction or doing graphic design on the

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,220
web then this is another thing that you

00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:14,929
might use in combination with it and

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,970
hopefully maybe some of you have seen

00:15:14,929 --> 00:15:18,980
how paths work in like image soft way

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,990
you know you draw a shape and then some

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,120
of its visible and some of its not let's

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,379
look at some examples

00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,480
the nice thing I liked about this was

00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,009
that the syntax and the sort of shapes

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,179
were all exactly the same so if you

00:15:28,009 --> 00:15:30,430
learn it once you can kind of use it

00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:32,050
anywhere

00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,579
they will although they will work in

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,700
exactly the same sorts of ways these are

00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:38,769
called confusingly basic shapes this

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,600
list of things and so I guess like as

00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,589
they introduce like more stuff and the

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,820
browser will just use the same thing

00:15:41,589 --> 00:15:48,639
which is quite easy so then you can

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,010
start doing this kind of thing again

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,360
quite an exciting example I did this

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,180
with the browser tools they just kind of

00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,649
dragged it around for this example worth

00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,120
knitting at this point you can use this

00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,470
on images as I've done here but you can

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,529
also use it on other elements as well

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,990
any HTML element and also SVG elements

00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,040
so this is again really exciting like I

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,589
showed this to design a friend's name

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,269
like you can do this in the browser

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:12,160
amazing and the reason they were so

00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,269
excited and I was so excited about it is

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,010
because I don't know if anyone's ever

00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:17,649
tried to do stuff like this in a sort of

00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:19,570
slightly you know complex layout or

00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,490
interestingly like visually interesting

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:23,170
layout but it ended up being a lot of

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,459
back-and-forth with me and the designer

00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,199
like they would give me an image and I

00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:27,579
would upload it and then they would show

00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:28,600
them and then they were saying oh that's

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,180
not quite right and then they would have

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,740
to go and make an image again and then I

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,810
would upload it and then I would show

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:37,149
them and hopefully that would be okay

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:38,980
and if it wasn't then you know we kind

00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,089
of repeated this process a lot but this

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,680
way I can just put them in front of a

00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:45,010
browser and let them do it you know

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,110
pretty so this is a real world example

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,870
this is the website that I work for

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:54,190
futurelearn comm and we used clip path

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:55,720
to do this kind of shape like blocking

00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:00,490
outline in the middle of this new

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,019
homepage module that we had which no one

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,790
can ever see on the slides because we've

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,709
used a really weird version of grey that

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:09,939
doesn't show up but there's supposed to

00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:12,990
be blocks down here this is how it looks

00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:15,370
on mobile so again like with CSS shapes

00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,829
you can use any unit you can make it

00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:19,419
responsive I think we use calculus as

00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,130
well in this case so that you know we

00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:24,819
had to like quite fine-grained control

00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:28,179
over it and it's pretty much another

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,710
one-liner we wanted this kind of quite

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:32,380
complicated shape so we did have to sort

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:34,780
of sit and work it out the team did some

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,820
mock-ups in code pen to sort of prove

00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,380
the concept and then they sat down

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,909
together and they just did it and here

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:41,110
we are because they did the shape here

00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:42,490
we didn't have to go back and forth with

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:45,010
those images

00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,050
and we were happy with this fullback so

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:49,000
if we don't have clip path support we

00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,700
just get a straight line yep fine like

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,830
for a one-liner I don't think there's a

00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,270
huge overhead in sending one extra line

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:58,900
of CSS it probably depends how much

00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,400
other CSS you're sending as well but our

00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,170
design team and we were quite happy with

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:07,300
this sort of extra flair that we can add

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:09,700
to the site so that's clip path on HTML

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:12,280
elements where it gets really exciting

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:14,980
and interesting I think is on SVG

00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,880
elements because SVG elements one of the

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,770
good things about them is that they can

00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,000
have text nodes inside so you can start

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,530
doing crazy stuff like this which

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,250
normally we would have had to use images

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,350
for and if we're using SVG we can also

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,940
have multiple shapes inside this is a

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,770
lot easier to do with clip paths than it

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,030
is with shapes I yeah you'd have a lot

00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:33,940
of stuff going on in there if you were

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:34,960
trying to do that with CSS shapes I I

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,400
think that if you're trying to do

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
something like this as well it's much

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,490
more performing because you can just

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,530
have like the one image maybe you could

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,300
do spriting with like different shapes

00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:46,150
coming out of a different area or

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:49,060
something like that so again let's look

00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:53,590
at browser support this is the HTML

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:55,750
version can I use tells us that support

00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,820
for clip path in SVG is supported in all

00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,350
browsers with basic SVG support that's

00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,210
not strictly true there's a few little

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,350
bugs and issues that we would come to

00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,180
you later

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,400
it's not quite as well supported as CSS

00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,510
shapes so you know these are the sorts

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,650
of things that you're having your mind

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,640
when you're like considering whether to

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:15,400
use one or the other so that's it for

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,380
practical tips the last thing I wanted

00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,790
to sort of share with you is to come

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,950
back to this idea of like this stuff has

00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:23,350
been around for a long time like years

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,540
why are we not using it and I think the

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,850
answer to that is that we've gotten to

00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,140
this kind of all-or-nothing mentality we

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:32,380
think that if something is not supported

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:37,390
in the browsers that are teams they like

00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:38,710
97% of browsers or you know the the

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,540
browser support kind of matrix that

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,040
we've laid out for ourselves it means

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,350
that we can't use it and I don't think

00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:46,690
that's true it just means we need to be

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:48,340
a tiny bit clever about the way that we

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,710
think things through and how we design

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,850
and how we build stuff and there are

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:53,950
some good tools that can help us with

00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,570
this as well

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,280
so this is the situation we found

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,890
ourselves in a future learn with the

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,180
module weed these are very simple

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,650
examples and they were very simple

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,940
examples on purpose so that we could

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:07,720
kind of learn about this stuff over the

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,100
last half an hour together we wanted to

00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:13,600
do something like slightly more

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:17,950
complicated so I showed this our example

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:21,310
earlier but this example is a little bit

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,990
simplified when I showed you on purpose

00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,400
again because I wanted to show a simple

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:26,110
example so that we could see how it all

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,590
works but actually there's a little bit

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,930
more going on here when we don't have

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:33,880
clip path support it's not entirely

00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:37,230
symmetrical you probably not be

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:41,620
surprised how much that annoys people

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:43,630
this is very annoying so we added some

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,880
margin so that things do actually line

00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,470
up when there is no clip path support

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,790
but now we're getting into a situation

00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,990
rival we don't want the clip we don't

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:55,330
want the margin if there is clip path

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:58,060
but we do what do we do that's okay we

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,400
can get back to this so we just reset

00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:03,130
the margins inside a future query using

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,920
the supports key word we say if clip

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,930
path is supported then we just want to

00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:10,990
reset that margin and if it's not then

00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:12,130
we will apply it it's the supports

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,690
keyword looks a bit like your media

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:17,230
query and it kind of works in the same

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,700
way I wanted to say also here that like

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,100
you don't have to use this if you're

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,900
just doing something that is you know an

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,680
avatar with a rounded circle around it

00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,730
or something like that then you don't

00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,230
need to kind of get into all of this

00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,910
it's only when you find yourselves in

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:28,990
those sort of slightly sticky situations

00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:30,580
where people are asking for stuff that

00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:34,450
you're not quite sure if it's lightning

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:36,360
this is quite complicated then this is

00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,710
when you would break out your supports

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,840
if you have some shenanigans and some

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,890
overriding and resetting to do then this

00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:46,600
is the place to use that and the

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,710
important thing to note as well yeah is

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,380
that we don't have to do this should we

00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,950
just get this full back and this can be

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,650
used as a sort of bold statement like

00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:58,180
we've seen in the exciting kind of art

00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,350
direction earlier or it can be used as a

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:01,330
sort of a little bit of extra flair

00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:03,700
around small elements throughout the

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:06,380
page but the one thing that is important

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,100
to remember is inclusive design patterns

00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:12,289
so this is another real-world example

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,360
from another creative agency an example

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,350
in the world again responsive I don't

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,799
know what they've done here but it looks

00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:21,710
really good so you might have noticed in

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:25,850
this example they've made very sure that

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:29,240
their text ends on the right hand side

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:31,400
because it's a left-to-right language I

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,539
always have trouble with those and this

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,340
is really important thing to remember

00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:35,840
when I was writing this talk I didn't

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,510
think of this and that's why my examples

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,500
that are sometimes the wrong way around

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:41,120
but it's very difficult when you're

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:44,179
reading along to go back and might pick

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,500
up the line on the other side so I would

00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:46,789
recommend thinking about things like

00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,830
that like who's reading this what's the

00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:52,880
audience what side do you want to have

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,960
this kind of art direction on so the

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,650
last thing I want to talk to you about

00:22:53,960 --> 00:23:00,830
is this this looks kind of dry and it

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,210
kind of is this is the CSS shapes spec

00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:05,780
does anyone actually read this stuff

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,010
maybe for other things than this but I

00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:08,809
think it's really important to kind of

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,940
keep our eyes on this as developers

00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:14,059
because this is how the web gets made

00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,140
right if we don't do this then browser

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,429
developers are not going to like if

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:19,220
there's no demand for it people are not

00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:21,020
going to implement it so okay don't go

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,450
and just read specs all the time I'm

00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,100
unless you need some sleep but follow

00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,260
people like jenna simmons follow people

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,340
like Rachel Andrews follow people who

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,880
are kind of doing interesting stuff with

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,440
this and sharing it with us they look to

00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,150
us for our feedback they want to know

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,070
what we want what our designers won what

00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,929
our clients want what do our

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:40,460
imaginations want and we should let them

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:43,820
know so that we keep getting more cool

00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,530
stuff so it's up to us as developers and

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,350
designers to share what we want and to

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,940
share what we find with the browser

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,860
developers and with our teams and with

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,440
each other so I'm really interested to

00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,840
find out what will you make tweet me and

00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:01,290
tell me and share your shapes throw some

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:05,950
shapes tell me how you go on thank you

00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,950
