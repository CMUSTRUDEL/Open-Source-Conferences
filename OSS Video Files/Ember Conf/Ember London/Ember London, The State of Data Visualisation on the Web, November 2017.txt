	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
I want to talk about the state of data

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,700
laser data visualization on the web have

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,069
you ever heard the expression

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,139
time is money or something like that

00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:11,040
well that's not right time is more

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:12,590
important than money

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,480
so what we can do is and we're trying

00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:18,150
navigate the wilderness for you guys

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,800
with comes that visualization because

00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,930
there's a whole bunch of stuff out there

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,320
right all the d3 guys and paraffin guys

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,689
have their libraries and all those web

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,580
devs have like our other stuff but I

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,380
think as I've met trend from more and

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,700
more stuff towards the web when it comes

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,190
to that of authorization statistics

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,989
machine learning which is good for us

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,100
because that's the best be honest we're

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:39,510
getting we're getting bored web

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,590
development there's just like if in devs

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,469
they're under the P agent and displaying

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,620
bit yeah so we have choices have choices

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:47,450
when it comes to everything d3 Cabana

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:51,899
Vega

00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:54,180
you know WebGL ubers you know 3GS

00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,039
babylons yes how do we pick what to do

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,129
with it whenever that validation

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,289
solution so we just like come to these

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,750
roads and we're like doing all right or

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,479
do we left or do we go around the Rona

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,580
boat and then down that road there so

00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:11,790
the future of that vegetation according

00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:18,530
to my humble opinion or maybe not so

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,340
humble opinion the WebGL and JavaScript

00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,990
there's some really cool stuff that's

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,490
going on right now there's like sediment

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,220
like Mandelbrot sets where you watch

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,530
these zoom and you zoom into the

00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,329
Mandelbrot set well you can do it in 3d

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,259
and WebGL and it's just there's some

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,030
funky stuff man

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,600
I've made a CD strategy game with the

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,640
Babylon GS no obviously as programmer

00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,750
speaking called analogic we once or you

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,250
could actually come up that

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,630
visualization solution and nobody's done

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,619
before just by using your programming

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,369
logic and somebody's like native 3d 3d

00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:48,930
objects that the Babylon

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,390
thank you soft made this female called

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:56,460
Bible mgs which is what I'm using here

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:59,159
and that allows square high-performance

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,829
framework allowing you to hates up heads

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,689
of the gory details of WebGL from you so

00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,430
what Ober I've done and actually talk to

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:06,420
the guy I mean can metaphor this what

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,940
uber I've done is they've actually

00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,289
created a small wrapper around WebGL

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,450
which doesn't hide you from little level

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:14,040
WebGL stuff by it sort of makes it look

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,569
more more friendly

00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,209
and he build this thing called deck gel

00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:20,220
on top of there Lumi nothing and what as

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:22,379
is it basically allows you to visualize

00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,019
big data that can plot millions of

00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,299
points on the screen at once using like

00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:31,680
even to submit my rubbish Mac here this

00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:32,940
is 2015 so big data it's really hard to

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,860
visualize some things what you've got

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,450
but will these kind of things you can't

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:38,610
she started visualize them so they have

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,379
all the stuff can I write inferred

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,489
reacts but I was talking to the guy and

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:43,049
say it's about you trying to extract

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,180
that out of reacts or the enemy can use

00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:48,150
it on any framework these are like like

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,640
city things and other stuff and like you

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:56,390
know obesity should workers in a minute

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,890
visual export a of large datasets and

00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:01,440
this is Google facets which is another

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,000
thing so they kind of picture as you

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,489
know what is a machine learning right

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,310
basically it takes data and categorizes

00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,859
a you know to Saturn like you want to

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,250
categorize something as a car or a dog

00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:17,329
or and you know categorize whether this

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,769
drawing matches a cheer or something so

00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:21,419
or even just like data you want to

00:03:19,769 --> 00:03:23,010
visualize but in a way that it's kind of

00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,959
for after the war a spreadsheet

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,120
this is facets things with the helps you

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:33,120
he'll give me a live demo this is

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:35,220
basically word this so let me just show

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,489
you a demo so this is ten thousand data

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:42,690
points it's a 2d drawing but it's over

00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:44,819
on web feature web gem WebGL canvas and

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,109
if you actually can see how this is real

00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,060
time by the way so I can actually

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:49,819
navigate this you click on any data

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,959
point and you can see the data here and

00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:55,530
you guess and this is not possible but

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,109
d3 or SVG's and what you can do is you

00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:59,669
can actually categorize you can actually

00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:02,940
faster ties these things into rows and

00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:05,579
columns so for example if we tick pick

00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,459
with a faceting and we can do a rule

00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,620
based faceting on CH and put them into

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:11,910
bends which you can sit so you see that

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,980
animation there that's how all those

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,889
things moving individually this is a

00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,799
again this is a rubbish Mac I've got so

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:23,070
this is like you can see here these are

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,919
like you can colorize by I think it's by

00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:27,450
occupations so you can colorize by a lot

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,690
of things you can colorize by something

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,690
like

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,000
module Cyril sighs so you can see like

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,550
all the red stuff here young people

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,120
basically we're never married and then

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:47,850
as you go up more people are married and

00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,710
then you've got this like divorced that

00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,949
area runs a lot of people don't get my

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,360
divorce throwing 39:54 right I don't

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:57,570
know why I take that they keep pecking

00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,660
this that thing it's kind of sad to look

00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:02,610
at many it also in Coke and fast i sat

00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,229
right on their ways and and the

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,639
practical one so you can do by a race

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:14,850
you want to see had my ideas are Paris

00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:16,290
so there we are so you see here that to

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,860
be honest it looks like the proportions

00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:21,090
or prefer race are kind of like similar

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,650
baby this is this is basically you can

00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,700
you can put anything Canada in here if

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,830
you want like this one here's another

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:30,180
one this is machine learning data set so

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,539
you have a bunch of drawings that

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:40,130
recognize like a face or something

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:40,130
I think it's loading

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:57,900
there's supposed to be a lot of like

00:05:52,370 --> 00:06:00,740
feces in here alright skip that this is

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:06,270
the best bet here this is this is Dec GL

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:07,590
so this is the best like I'm the

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,000
maecenas anything eyes before than the

00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:12,120
browser's this is crazy

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,800
like this is like real-time 3d points

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,910
and the clout I just I don't know my

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,910
Internet's working first year

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:33,510
shame

00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,510
I think he's just loading a lot of data

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:41,870
all right here we are this is crazy

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:47,120
right these are all like individual

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:48,620
points that can even plot and you can

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,830
add imagine one that's not like a decent

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:56,240
match look at the GPU there's another

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:04,550
cool one where you got like all these

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:06,230
like street accidents in the UK so you

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,980
can basically see what's going on going

00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,530
wrong in London

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,180
Philly's accidents and you can like

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,710
change the radius of the points to get

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:19,300
even more resolution so this is like

00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,300
never drawing a lot of points right now

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:28,370
any book will check it out oh those are

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:30,470
these are feces so like this is a

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,990
machine line data set so each point has

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,210
like at it is recognized or not so you

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:38,330
can actually color by things like is it

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:41,210
recognized and then the computer will

00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:43,100
see this is basically you can categorize

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,140
both these facets vertical horizontal

00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:48,350
and then you can go and see what the

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,270
computer so this is basically this is

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,750
this not recognized as a face right and

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,370
this is like so this is like computer

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,040
looks of that and thinks now it's not a

00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,960
face no there's a well some of them are

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:03,410
like I don't know why it doesn't think

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:05,030
that's not face and like this like also

00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:08,900
you can make these are like strokes I

00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:14,770
think as if they care they're number of

00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:16,760
strokes so like somehow it thinks that

00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,410
you think that maybe the more strokes

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,750
would be more more accurate but the

00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,760
sometimes the machine learning the more

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,610
strokes that are the wash that gets

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:29,090
returned ah okay great so the more

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:32,990
simple like to a certain point rate I

00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:35,120
mean oh there's like a bare minimum

00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,320
there's like a sweet spots or you can

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,460
look at this data you can very quickly

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,070
see like what is what's happening and

00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:50,810
and I'm like but a MIDI and stuff all

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:54,530
that thing don't lies work okay so I'll

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:57,350
just go and rest the slides so we know

00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,810
we have deep learning capabilities in

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,210
the browser this is Google's one of

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,100
Google's latest projects so all people

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,900
like me that basically program for nine

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,150
years I can't avoid learning Python and

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,410
it cuz it's not another language no we

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,690
don't need to learn a long language we

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,120
can use our JavaScript skills to use

00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:15,890
machine learning and they actually have

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,610
things running in a browser like playing

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,810
piano real-time with based on what the

00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,040
machine is learned when it comes to

00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,910
looking other composers and especially

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,150
running in a browser

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:29,210
what it does is it uses it shifts all

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:32,330
the complicated calculations from

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,730
JavaScript over to the GPU and it gets

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,230
the results back from the GPU until

00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:38,240
you're at your normal JavaScript

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,310
programming 5,000 stars I'm actually

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,960
just looking at Sunwest did about

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,190
research on it I make some youtube

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,830
videos as much a figure out what's going

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,670
on because I don't like one of the

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,780
things that Gabe brought when they

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,490
sought something like you need

00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,870
Visual Studio or Microsoft cord to run

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,760
this thing I was like whoa I'm ain't

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,410
going in stop putting system issues but

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,120
you know it's exciting

00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:58,520
another thing Microsoft have their own

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,080
version of Google facets so it's called

00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,580
sand ants it's been around for over four

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,130
years this is somewhat kind of stuff as

00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:08,089
benning this time faceting or bending

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:13,610
and d3 we all know what these three is

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:14,990
anyone use d3 so do freeze like SVG well

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:17,930
more at that's right it's like toolset

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,880
you could Envy d3 which is like the

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:23,270
chart this off easy chap chartwrapper

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:27,230
around d3 if you can use that and it's

00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:30,770
like a macbook version of all this tool

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:32,660
set you go bigger which is another sort

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:36,020
of wrapper around d3 so said are using

00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,990
declarative solid procedural code you've

00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:42,080
got this sort of declarative JSON files

00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:44,150
which specify how things should look I'm

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,890
not used it but I've played around with

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:47,290
it

00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:50,650
but Cabana Koran is like a thing it

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:52,030
looks a bunch of Jason and then people

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,290
like the bald dashboards around it and

00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:54,730
that's that so what's the competition

00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,360
for these guys quick piece of

00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,200
development

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,710
lots opportunities we get deeper in and

00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:05,310
it's all in so and that's it thanks for

00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:05,310
