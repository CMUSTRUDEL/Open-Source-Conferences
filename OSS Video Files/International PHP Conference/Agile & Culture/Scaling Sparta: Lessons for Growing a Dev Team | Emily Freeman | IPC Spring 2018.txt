Title: Scaling Sparta: Lessons for Growing a Dev Team | Emily Freeman | IPC Spring 2018
Publication date: 2019-02-11
Playlist: Agile & Culture
Description: 
	Emily Freeman (Kickbox): Scaling systems is hard, but we’re developers — that’s kind of our thing. Scaling people? Well, that’s significantly harder. Humans are complicated.

Broadly speaking, companies have three stages of development: infancy, those awkward teenage years and — if they survive the trials of adolescence — adulthood. An infant startup is so drastically different from its adult incarnation that they can be considered different companies. Each will have a unique mission and culture.

Scaling isn’t just about making what you have bigger. An ant can’t be scaled to the size of an elephant. Because the internal structure is fundamentally different. Instead, companies have to evolve. But companies aren’t living, breathing organisms. They’re collections of people — families, tribes and civilizations. So how do you scale a team of two to twenty? The answer starts over 2,000 years ago in Sparta.

good morning I am Emily Freeman I am a

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,420
developer advocate for a company called

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,880
kickbox our API is a better smarter

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,220
reCAPTCHA that ensures your users are

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,890
actual people with legitimate email

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,640
addresses I'm three are thrilled to be

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,250
here with you all in Berlin scaling

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,600
systems is hard but many of us are

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:39,390
developers so that's kind of our thing

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:43,430
scaring people well that's significantly

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:46,350
harder people are complicated

00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:50,160
broadly speaking companies have three

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,610
stages of development infancy those

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,920
awkward teenage years and if they

00:00:53,610 --> 00:01:00,690
survive the trials of adolescence

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,539
adulthood an infant startup is so

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,640
drastically different from its adult

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,909
incarnation that they could be

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:12,619
considered different companies each will

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,570
have a unique mission and culture

00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:18,150
scaling isn't just about making what you

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,580
have bigger an ant

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,979
can't be scaled to the size of an

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,640
elephant because the internal structure

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:30,439
is fundamentally different

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:33,979
instead companies have to evolve but

00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:38,030
companies aren't living breathing

00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:43,710
organisms their collections of people

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:48,060
families tribes civilizations so how do

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:50,040
you scale a team of two to twenty well

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,700
the answer starts over two thousand

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,720
years ago

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,270
in Sparta this talk is going to focus on

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,119
three distinct military organizations

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:04,740
the Spartans the Mongols and the Romans

00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,590
Sparta standing army was relatively

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,900
small whereas Rome's peaked at nearly

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,550
half

00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,950
we'll look at the organization of each

00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:16,770
military how they treated their soldiers

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,200
what they prioritized and then we'll

00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,180
apply those lessons to our own

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,180
development teams and organizations

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,580
scaling an army of soldiers or

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,240
developers or anyone else comes down to

00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,570
communication and collaboration how do

00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:41,820
you keep a group of people informed and

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:44,130
working together toward a shared goal if

00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,910
there's just a few folks it's probably

00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,550
no big deal

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,070
right you're most likely all in the same

00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,530
room you can yell at each other when you

00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,810
have a question or a comment and you

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,840
likely have the entire code base mapped

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,200
in your head because you probably wrote

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,340
the whole thing but as your team gets

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,090
bigger more and more intersections of

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:11,420
communication develop and with that

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:13,920
opportunities for miscommunication

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:15,600
there's actually a formula for this I

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,240
shouldn't be surprised it seems like

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,730
there's a math formula for everything

00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:24,120
I'll spare you the math though for a

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:28,710
team of five there are ten connections

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:35,070
it's not so bad that's manageable a team

00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:38,280
of 10 jumps to 45 a team of 20 brings us

00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,400
up to a hundred and ninety and what

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:48,630
about a team of a hundred developers

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:52,590
does their on how I guess 4950 nearly

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:55,050
five thousand ways your team can

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,030
communicate now is anyone else totally

00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,570
overwhelmed because I feel like this

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:02,720
adorable yet definitely melancholy pug

00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:05,190
just thinking about that

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,540
before I continue I want to acknowledge

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:12,570
that scaling is messy and it always will

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,210
be we don't exist in a vacuum

00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,630
there's no petri dish in which to try

00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:20,430
different approaches and see what works

00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:25,860
many times due to resource constraints

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:28,830
we get one shot and if we fail well game

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,980
over but there are some things that we

00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:36,150
can do better as developers and as

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:39,410
managers so where do we start with

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:43,380
sparta our startup of the ancient world

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:46,710
they were small and its largest the

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:52,370
standing army number 10,000 and Sparta

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:54,720
was obsessed with what it did best war

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,820
they also had a thing with nudity but

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,630
this conference has a code of conduct so

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:03,450
that could get awkward pretty quickly

00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,470
most Greek city-states were fortified by

00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:11,010
a wall Sparta instead chose to defend

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:15,990
themselves with a wall of men that's

00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:16,880
bold this obsession with war started at

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:19,950
day one

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,100
newborns were taken by their fathers to

00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:26,730
the Gaza a council of elders for

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,310
inspection infanticide was common in all

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,370
of Greece and Sparta was unfortunately

00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:35,130
no exception children who were not

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:39,390
deemed strong enough were abandoned and

00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:42,390
left to die of exposure at age seven

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:45,570
boys were taken to the ago Sh a military

00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:46,770
training facility and barracks girls

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,410
were permitted to stay with their

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,169
parents they were actually educated and

00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,870
encouraged to exercise which was unique

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:59,120
in the Greek city-states so yay for kind

00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,890
of equal rights spartans issued all

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,430
comforts and it said that they were the

00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:10,050
only people for whom war was a reprieve

00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:13,050
from everyday life their staple diet

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,230
consisted of blood broth exactly what it

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,450
sounds like

00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:20,020
and the boys appiah ghosh were regularly

00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:23,440
denied food and clothing they were

00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:28,180
encouraged to steal but beaten harshly

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:32,020
if caught not for stealing but for being

00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:35,830
caught everything about the ago SH

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:38,620
hardened these boys for warfare at age

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:43,830
12 they were sent out with only a red

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:46,780
cloak and expected to survive at age 20

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:50,380
soldiers joined assist YCJA which is a

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,860
sort of mess or club spartan peers and

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,980
members of the mess had to vote to

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,970
accept men into their group and voting

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:03,400
had to be unanimous if a soldier had not

00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:06,940
been invited to join Isis issue by the

00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,940
age of 30 he would be denied spartan

00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,510
citizenship and instead occupy a lower

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:16,900
standing men were permitted to marry

00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:19,000
from age 20 on but they would remain in

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:22,690
the barracks away from their wives and

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,210
children until age 30 they would

00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:30,520
continue to serve as reservists until

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:33,220
age 60 which is crazy all Spartans were

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,670
equal and submissive to the unit as a

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:39,820
whole soldiers who lost their hot blonde

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:42,100
or shield were disgraced because the

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,520
shield protected not only that man but

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:49,140
the man on his left Spartans were a

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:52,900
small tribe of intensely loyal

00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:55,390
overworked and under fed soldiers who

00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,500
bravely took on the big boys of the

00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:02,650
ancient world the Battle of Thermopylae

00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,980
pitted 300 Spartans 700 thespians and

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:09,160
400 theevans against supposedly a

00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,320
hundred thousand Persians and isn't that

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,240
how every startup would like to imagine

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:17,290
themselves maybe without the core

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,810
strength and rugged good looks when you

00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:23,139
are in the startup phase I want you to

00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:27,229
find what you do best

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:30,259
Spartans were unmatched in war if an

00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:33,669
ally were threatened all they had to do

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:37,370
was send one man a single soldier

00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:40,130
dressed in that iconic red cloak

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,950
because enemies knew that a fight with

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:46,730
one Spartan was a fight with all of

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:49,930
Sparta you're too young to be worried

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:52,610
about anything the product market fit

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:57,019
find the product that resonates with

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,420
people and focus on that you can a B

00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:04,360
test button colors and all the other

00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:08,690
things later now is not the time hire

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:13,190
generalists you need people capable of

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:16,579
solving just about any problem Spartans

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:20,510
didn't have Special Forces every soldier

00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:22,880
was trained in everything they followed

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:28,190
the same strategies treated each other

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:30,170
as equals the people you need may not be

00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,510
up-to-date on the latest and greatest

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,630
JavaScript framework because really who

00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:38,600
is there's like two a year but they do

00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:43,579
have a certain grit a dogged

00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:46,730
determination to figure it out at this

00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:51,230
stage specialists could hinder progress

00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,140
by narrowing their focus to quickly keep

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:57,470
your team agile and focused on how to

00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,420
solve the problem most efficiently not

00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:05,149
how to solve it using a specific tool

00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:09,079
allow natural communication pathways to

00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:11,930
form a desire path is a path formed

00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,760
through erosion caused by humans or

00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,380
animals walking over the same piece of

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,699
land over and over and over

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,579
communication actually follows a similar

00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:26,269
pattern and some of us are better at it

00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:28,000
than others observe who communicates

00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,050
with the team on your team or

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,740
communicates with your team most

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,400
effectively you need to delegate

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,740
responsibilities

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,770
bring others up to speed on things allow

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,640
that person to take the idea and then

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:46,250
deliver it to the group take on the big

00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,710
voice listen when you've got to

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,830
developers and three to six months a

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:55,760
financial runway you have nothing to

00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:58,730
lose all the statistics say that you are

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:02,120
going to crash and burn so might as well

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,310
make it spectacular give it everything

00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,920
you've got

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,110
300 Spartans marched right up to a

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,270
hundred thousand Persians and challenged

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,010
them to a fight

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:17,390
worst case you learned some valuable

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:21,920
lessons best case you become github and

00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:25,190
are purchased by Microsoft the Mongols

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,610
are by fire my favorite of these three

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,230
militaries they are absolutely

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:33,890
fascinating and they serve as our

00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:36,410
analogue for midsize teams you can

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:39,710
consider it our awkward teenager of an

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:43,160
organization the Mongol army topped out

00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:46,130
at about a hundred thousand it is to

00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,880
this day the largest Geographic empire

00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:52,640
in history they conquered nearly all of

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,750
continental Asia the Middle East and

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,670
parts of Eastern Europe no one could

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:01,130
have expected that Mongols would

00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:05,330
influence history in the way that they

00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:08,230
did as a people they sat quietly in the

00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,440
foothills of Siberia mastering

00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:14,420
horsemanship

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:17,780
and archery but like most nomadic tribes

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:22,250
who live in brutal conditions they were

00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:25,040
tough like real tough the Mongols and

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:27,860
their conquests are forever married to

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,690
Genghis Khan or chingus depending on who

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,160
you ask

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:35,930
Tim Egan the boy who would become

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:39,350
Genghis Khan was born in 1162 to a lowly

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,750
and unremarkable tribe his father was

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,460
poisoned when he was young and he was

00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:46,180
left to the care of his older brothers

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,340
one of whom he murdered in a fight

00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:52,390
so family reunions were probably pretty

00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:55,260
awkward as a teenager he married Berta

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:57,940
his first and most influential wife

00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,610
early on in their marriage she was

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:03,400
kidnapped a pretty common practice in

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:07,600
Mongolia at the time and his rescue of

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,760
her proved his military medal he went on

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,670
to unite the Mongol tribes by

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:15,730
instigating a brutal civil war and was

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:19,750
an eventual II named Great Khan ruling

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:23,620
over all of Mongolia Genghis was a

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:27,520
brilliant military leader the Mongols

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:31,660
conquered more land in 25 years then the

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:35,230
Romans did in 400 he did this through a

00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:38,380
number of tactics Mongols embraced

00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:42,430
religious tolerance conquered people

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:45,880
could practice their religions freely he

00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:48,490
promoted people on merit and brought

00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,130
people from lower tribes into his own

00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,640
while doing away with the rich and

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:58,060
powerful families this made him

00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:01,690
extremely popular Mongol society was

00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:04,750
pretty egalitarian both men and women

00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:07,000
contributed and women didn't suffer from

00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,160
the typical patriarchal domination you

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,710
see in many other societies of the time

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:15,040
- the whole wife kidnapping thing I

00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:18,400
haven't figured that part out yet he

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:22,750
reinvigorated the Silk Road an ensured

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:26,380
safe passage for travelers he enabled I

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,600
enabled globalized trade according to

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,940
legend a woman carrying a sack of gold

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,750
could travel safely from one end of the

00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:38,590
Empire to the other the Mongols were

00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,930
uncommon ly adaptable even though they

00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:44,830
had no experience with walled cities

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:47,740
they mastered seas warfare cities were

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:49,510
often so afraid of slaughter that they

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,080
simply surrendered as soon as the

00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:56,230
Mongols showed up Mongols defeated

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,310
nations that had a hundred times the

00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,920
manpower

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:03,370
which is kind of what a midsize company

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,980
needs to do you've got that product

00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:09,040
market fit now it's time to build an

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:14,339
empire so how do we apply Genghis Khan's

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:18,069
wisdom to our own teams avoid emotional

00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:21,370
decision-making above all else Genghis

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:25,089
Khan was a master strategist in the

00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,949
early days things are rocky one day you

00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:30,040
had a customer that will pay this

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:31,839
month's entire AWS bill and the next the

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,079
site's down and people are calling just

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,439
to scream at you reactionary businesses

00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:40,779
rarely survive so start to think in an

00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:42,370
ood a loop and if you're unfamiliar

00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:45,519
that's not just a fun English word to

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:48,220
say though it is fun Judas the OODA loop

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,809
was created by Colonel John Boyd of the

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,800
Air Force the US Air Force

00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:57,939
it stands for observe orient decide and

00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,399
act this will allow you to rapidly work

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:03,490
through problems and prevent yourself

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:07,509
from being bogged down by fear

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,670
uncertainty and doubt it's even better

00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:13,649
if you can get inside your competitors

00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:17,589
food a loop and up into their strategy

00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:20,170
avoid micromanagement Mongol officers

00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:23,319
and troops were given significant

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:26,860
freedom by their superiors in executing

00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,410
orders as long as the larger objectives

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:33,309
were met Mongol soldiers could solve

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:38,350
problems as they saw fit in other words

00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:41,110
they focused on what not how as you grow

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:45,040
you want to keep your team focused on

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:49,199
the larger mission whatever that is but

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:53,139
give them the room to do their job an

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,149
able autonomy Mongol soldiers typically

00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:58,329
maintained three to four horses at a

00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:59,920
time they swapped horses frequently and

00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:03,399
because of this they could travel at

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,730
high speeds for days without stopping or

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:07,950
exhausting their animal

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:11,010
they had an extraordinary ability to

00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,690
live off the land and extreme conditions

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:15,650
they could actually live off their

00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:18,030
horses mostly through mares milk

00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:22,380
unlike other armies they weren't

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:26,010
dependent on supply logistics give your

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:29,790
employees the resources they need to get

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:32,750
the job done support them and if you're

00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:35,400
in a management position protect them

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,910
the VP of Product wants a feature done

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:42,000
yesterday of course because I always do

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:44,460
but that's now is not the time to freak

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,680
out instead embrace your inner Genghis

00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,050
Khan and start yelling at executives

00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:54,000
this terrible advice don't don't do that

00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:56,250
you will get fired stay small much like

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,980
our modern military the Mongol army was

00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,910
organized into small squads but together

00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:05,100
made up larger units Grameen doesn't

00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:07,200
mean that all of your developers now

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:10,320
report to a single manager who reports

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,820
to a single VP reports the CTO because I

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,740
think we all know an organization like

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:19,110
that instead embrace those small groups

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,080
close-knit family like structures of

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:25,770
people that can merge into larger groups

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:29,370
when necessary start to introduce

00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:31,740
structure but keep it simple now it's

00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:34,770
not the time to go full in on JIRA and

00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,050
hire a scrum master instead do something

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:40,680
as simple as implementing a daily stand

00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:43,260
up start tracking features and bugs on a

00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,860
whiteboard or with a very simple

00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,590
tracking tool at this stage too much

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,130
communication is inefficient and too

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:56,010
little will result in confusion the last

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:59,370
thing you want is to developers trying

00:18:56,010 --> 00:19:01,620
to fix the same bug I have fixed those

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:05,070
merge conflicts zero out of ten would

00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,650
not recommend prevent yourself from

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:10,800
falling into the trap of acting like a

00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:12,810
real company whatever that means to you

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,300
I mean file your taxes and do things

00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:17,300
legally please

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:19,400
but now is not the time to start a

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,030
formal annual review process or

00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:26,000
mandatory weekly one-on-ones instead

00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:29,990
focus it's easy at this stage to get

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:33,110
excited about all the things I see a lot

00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:35,990
of founders fall into this trap and part

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:41,000
of our job is to push back on crazy

00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:45,110
ideas as developers find your one market

00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,200
focus on your most successful value add

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:51,110
once you have revenue a majority market

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:57,140
share in one area you can start invading

00:19:51,110 --> 00:20:00,380
the others for now stay focused if you

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,340
survive the pimply mistake ridden years

00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:07,190
of scaling a start-up into an enterprise

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:10,490
congratulations your Rome Rome is our

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:13,610
large scale organization reliability and

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:17,090
predictability has become a lot more

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:18,740
critical you are an empire now it's more

00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:22,810
important to protect what you've already

00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:26,360
built than it is to be a disrupter

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:29,870
administration management and process

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:33,740
Eclipse rock star developers and game

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:36,950
changing ideas rome was a nearly

00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:40,130
unstoppable force one of the largest

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:43,880
empires the world has ever seen its

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:48,310
legacy continues to influence our daily

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:53,060
life via language law government

00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:56,660
religion architecture and more the Roman

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:59,090
Empire spanned over 2,000 years and its

00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:02,210
military structure is a graduate level

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,700
course in and of itself Edward Gibbons

00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:07,670
the decline and fall of the Roman Empire

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:11,180
is just short of 4,000 pages and that's

00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:13,520
just the decline and fall I can't

00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,500
possibly do it justice in the next few

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,630
minutes but I will highlight the

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:21,800
structure of the Imperial Roman army

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:26,440
which reach its peak size of 450,000 in

00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:29,350
211 ad Emperor Augustus

00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:32,350
the second emperor of rome founded the

00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,900
imperial army prior to him rome

00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:38,710
motivated soldiers with grants of land

00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:41,050
and increased wealth but his land became

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,660
more scarce they shifted toward

00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:44,410
rewarding soldiers with a set amount of

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,920
denarii

00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:51,300
after their service for citizen soldiers

00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:54,520
it was the equivalent of 13 years salary

00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,470
which sounds a lot like a pension am i

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,480
right

00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:01,840
the Imperial Army was split into two

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,740
groups what you can think of as officers

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,540
and enlisted soldiers very broadly the

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,170
commissioned officers were assigned to

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:14,590
legions heavy infantry made up of 5000

00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:18,100
Roman citizens each long-term

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:21,760
professional soldiers served 25 year

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,970
terms and conscription a draft was to

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,790
create only in emergencies in addition

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:31,180
to legions beocca sylia was established

00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:34,420
these enlisted troops were recruited

00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:37,990
from the Peregrine non-citizen residence

00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:41,890
the auxilia supplied infantry cavalry

00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:44,980
archers and special forces auxiliaries

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:48,640
were awarded Roman citizenship after

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:52,060
completing their 25 year commitment the

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,640
army also employed numeri mercenaries

00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:56,920
from allied people outside the empire

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,330
today we know these people as

00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:04,780
contractors organizationally every

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,850
province had legate legion commanders

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,790
who reported to the provincial governor

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:12,100
and governors reported directly to the

00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:14,700
emperor in Rome which is a much flatter

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:17,580
structure than I would have imagined

00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:21,090
while legionaries held a higher status

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:24,190
they depended heavily on the accelya

00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:27,940
legions were entirely heavy infantry

00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:31,450
foot soldiers in metal armor they were

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:34,690
almost unbeatable by other infantry but

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:38,190
could not campaign alone just like

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:42,870
developers would be lost without teams

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:47,039
product and DevOps and design so what

00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:49,590
can we glean from Rome break into small

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,529
teams we do the same thing in our

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,220
applications right when a class gets too

00:23:52,529 --> 00:24:00,139
big we abstract logic away into smaller

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:03,690
components the same applies to people

00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:06,659
but allow divisions to form naturally

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,509
each unit in the Roman army has its own

00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:13,139
standard which was a pole with a variety

00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:16,259
of decorations the practical use was to

00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:20,220
visually notify soldiers where the bulk

00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:22,639
of their unit was on the battlefield but

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:25,289
these standards help deep meaning

00:24:22,639 --> 00:24:27,690
soldiers believe their standards

00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,659
represented a divine spirit and they

00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:33,000
would pray to them the symbol brought

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:37,470
everyone together much like a country's

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,870
flag does for its citizens set a clear

00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,960
vision think of the small teams you

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:45,929
formed as little Sparta's go back to

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:50,100
those fundamentals and allow each team

00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:54,059
autonomy but be clear about the broader

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:56,220
vision teams without a focused goal will

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,309
naturally prioritize the things they're

00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,759
interested in not necessarily the things

00:24:59,309 --> 00:25:05,190
that are best for the company as a whole

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,889
leadership must regularly communicate

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:12,299
the direction the larger organization is

00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:15,240
headed and why and the why is even more

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:19,440
important than the what because it lends

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:22,169
context and clarity but be careful about

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,679
how many times you moved the cheese so

00:25:22,169 --> 00:25:27,690
to speak it's okay to pivot if you need

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,149
to and the future of the company depends

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:32,549
on it but changing priorities every

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:35,909
quarter will undermine your credibility

00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:40,590
as an organization when your word means

00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:44,610
nothing people stop listening become

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:47,290
masters of logistics and planning when

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,820
you are big Logistics matter

00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,280
and this is where teams like

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,010
infrastructure and DevOps really start

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:56,860
to play a critical role Romans

00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:57,970
invested heavily in an extensive and

00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,760
well-maintained

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:04,360
road system they allowed their troops to

00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:07,270
move relatively rapidly as needed while

00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,120
smaller armies could forage purchase or

00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,130
steal food the Roman forces were simply

00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,680
too large

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,870
instead deployed forces were regularly

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:20,020
resupply through a massive network of

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:23,650
supply chains this infrastructure is

00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:27,400
what separated Rome from its competitors

00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:31,470
just like the work you do allows

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,450
companies to grow at breakneck speeds

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:37,300
for modern development teams this is

00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:40,270
akin to project management agile scrum

00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,550
extreme programming it doesn't really

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:44,770
matter what's more important is that you

00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:48,160
pick one pick the one that works for

00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,520
your team and then implement it stick to

00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:54,460
it the more logistical thinking you can

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,550
remove from your developers plates means

00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:02,470
that the more time they have to do what

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:05,440
they do best engineer solutions invest

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,650
in your employees take care of them

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,380
this means focusing on work-life balance

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:14,440
I know the Europeans do this a lot

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,540
better than the Americans do but if

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,040
you're stressed because a release needs

00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:25,180
to be to go out today I want you to ask

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:28,090
yourself why is it because you set an

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,220
unrealistic expectation with clients or

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,600
is it because the calendar says that

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:35,980
Thursday's are when we release new

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,330
features emergencies happen I think when

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,740
the site goes down everyone knows

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:40,930
they're not going home for dinner

00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,870
but those situations are few and far

00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:46,630
between working around the clock and

00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:48,520
checking email at home doesn't make your

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:53,260
employees hard workers

00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:55,660
it makes them former employees Rome had

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:58,300
a vested interest in the health and

00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:59,580
well-being of their soldiers they

00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,190
developed sophistic

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,770
medical knowledge and practices and for

00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,490
good reason a Sikh soldier can't be

00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:10,980
relied on to campaign or defend a city

00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:15,090
offering generous insurance is a start

00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,590
at least where we need insurance but

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:20,340
having conversations about mental health

00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:22,980
and burnout are also important anxiety

00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:25,260
and depression affect millions of us

00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:27,690
many of us in this room deal with some

00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:31,170
kind of mental health issue on a weekly

00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:34,590
if not daily basis engineering can be

00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:36,390
lonely grueling work you sit alone with

00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,460
a computer most of the day

00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:40,400
punching in new commands and having it

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,560
print out error messages at you

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:47,430
literally yelling at you for not coding

00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,980
well enough simply recognizing how hard

00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:52,920
your team works acknowledging that

00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:56,340
everyone needs breaks and promoting

00:28:52,920 --> 00:29:00,440
frequent work free vacations can do

00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:03,540
wonders for the longevity of your team

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,870
introduced specialists or allow your

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,520
generalists to become specialists some

00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,600
of your generalists may express an

00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,830
interest in management many will not

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:17,100
allocating team members may feel

00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:20,070
relatively arbitrary at first but if you

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:23,040
allow some flexibility in movement

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:27,120
between teams each person will slowly

00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:31,040
find his or her niche finally have

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,070
honest conversations no matter your size

00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:38,070
conflict is uncomfortable I get it

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:40,950
but is an absolute requirement for being

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:44,670
a good manager and I think for being a

00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:47,190
good human I thrive in an environment of

00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:50,160
a late stage startup I don't have the

00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:51,240
risk tolerance for the early days of a

00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,370
start-up when it's incredibly

00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,440
touch-and-go and I'm enough of an

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,810
entrepreneur that I don't do well

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,560
constrained by strict rules that guide

00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:04,080
many large organizations people that

00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,150
thrive when there are two developers may

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,690
not transition well as the company

00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:11,970
advances and grows that's okay

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:15,000
unhappy employees can quickly become

00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:18,870
poison for teams bringing everyone down

00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,670
an honest conversation is the best way

00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:23,880
to make sure each person on your team

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:27,270
feels content and fulfilled by their

00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:30,810
work some of the advice in this talk

00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:34,890
applies to you some may not you know

00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:37,830
your team best follow your instincts but

00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:41,880
be careful how much emotion guides your

00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:44,610
judgement collect data whenever you can

00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,700
it will keep you focused and inform

00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:50,400
decisions as you grow trust your

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:54,720
employees grant them the freedom to do

00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:57,360
what they do best solve problems hire

00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:01,080
people who are happy trustworthy

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,440
communicative and talented and above all

00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:08,970
else serve as an example of someone who

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,040
is fair focused and enthusiastic no one

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,520
wants to work for someone who won't roll

00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:16,620
up her sleeves and jump in when needed

00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:20,480
thank you so much for having me

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:25,559
[Applause]

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,559
