00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:13,380
I know it's late so I'm going to go fast

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:16,260
because I'm who's well who has Shazam

00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,930
again okay now here's a better question

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:23,550
who's thirsty oh that's not enough hands

00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,930
so you guys those of you who have the

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,990
app know Shazam

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,990
as as an app you know you know as this

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,100
music app where it's the home of music

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,930
discoveries this is where you know

00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:39,180
people come to discover that it's Daft

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,070
Punk playing but people don't know about

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,489
Shazam as Shazam's actually been around

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:48,239
since 2000 schism started building the

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:51,539
database 17 years ago back then it was a

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,420
premium SMS service you would send a

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,960
sound file off to two five eight oh that

00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,239
was the short code for Shazam and a few

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,699
minutes later a few minutes later you

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,729
would get an SMS message back telling

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,030
you the name of the artists in the song

00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,460
today

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,290
it's become a verb so Shazam has been

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,790
around long enough that it's a verb let

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,720
me show Sam that for you it's like

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,430
Google or Skype so it's an it's a verb

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,710
across all languages I actually had an

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,170
argument with our development team in

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,350
London because they would have dishes

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,060
am2 Vaughn for a Shazam from somebody

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,130
I'm like it's not dishes amp'd it's

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,119
Shazam Shazam Shazam in Ukranian it's

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,530
Shazam the app has now actually been the

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,659
reason why it's a verb is because the

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,430
app has been installed by 1 billion

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:40,290
people has been installed 1 billion

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,320
times since 2008 so we were one of the

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,960
first apps in the App Store I'm American

00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,479
and the first commercial for an iPhone

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,460
in the US was actually someone using

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,329
Shazam so they just had a commercial of

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,439
the Shazam app experience as the benefit

00:01:54,329 --> 00:02:00,920
for having an iPhone here in Germany the

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:05,070
app has been installed 55 million times

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:08,039
since 2008 and we have 7 million monthly

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,819
active users on average on average in

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,069
2016 the app was installed 858 thousand

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,980
times per month

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:18,310
here in Germany and that's just with

00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:21,980
organic there's no marketing behind that

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:24,230
and also for usage the app is used over

00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:28,459
a million times per day here in Germany

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:31,069
that's a lot of data this is actually

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:33,200
something I like to show this is a heat

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,590
map of where people actually use Shazam

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,450
in Germany over the course of one month

00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,010
I hope I'm not going to offend anyone

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:42,169
from mecklenburg-vorpommern or old

00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:45,230
Brandenburg when I show this but there's

00:02:42,169 --> 00:02:47,629
there's a bad cell reception there I

00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,980
also say cows don't have cell phones but

00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:53,569
that's a different joke this this is

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,569
this is just a bit of who our audience

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:58,489
is our audience if you look at the age

00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,290
ranges everybody thinks that the Shazam

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,790
audience is really young actually the

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,299
Shazam audience covers everybody

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,609
everybody who loves music across all age

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:11,150
ranges there's a little couple of

00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:12,290
demographics about our users in terms of

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,090
what they're into there into health and

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:16,879
fitness beauty products that sort of

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,889
thing but this here is actually kind of

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,530
what's interesting it's where the where

00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:24,439
the as our CEO says where the magic

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,470
happens so the the the the name Shazam

00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:29,090
actually comes from a genie in a bottle

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:30,829
when the genie from the bottle grant

00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,900
your wish he always says Shazam so

00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:36,590
Shazam is magically granting your wish

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,449
of telling you that it's Daft Punk here

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,979
you can see what people actually Shazam

00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:44,419
in Germany this is data on the genre so

00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:46,129
of course pop is number one because

00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:49,519
that's what the radio station is playing

00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:53,209
most of the time most Shazam's come look

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,579
78% at home 78% while you're in the car

00:03:53,209 --> 00:04:00,109
so this is a lot of people listening to

00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:02,449
the radio 30% are at the work even 20%

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:04,069
are at the movies so this shows you

00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:06,979
people are in different places at home

00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:10,129
78% people are using the app in in

00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,810
different locations so around three or

00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:15,709
four years ago we started looking at how

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,469
people are consuming media and one of

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:21,469
the reasons why Shazam was actually

00:04:17,469 --> 00:04:23,029
built was for people wanting to know

00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,620
what's the name people would go into

00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,450
Google and say what's the name of the

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,910
song

00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:32,390
the et movie or whatever or what's the

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:34,430
name of the song from the BMW commercial

00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,410
so these would be Google searches back

00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,640
in 2000 now people just pull out their

00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:42,620
phone and they're Shazam in while

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:46,880
they're watching TV and so that's why we

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:49,750
created a TV product within the app so

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,340
people are consuming media differently

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,010
78% of people will use their mobile

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,750
phone while watching television so this

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,430
is a good example of this is my wife is

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,310
from Stuttgart so that means she watches

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,020
Todd all the time and while she's

00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,580
watching Todd or I'm sitting playing on

00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,970
my phone texting with my friends on

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,740
whatsapp about how bad the episode is

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,740
but there was one episode I think it was

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,170
pulled it's I roof on zines know this is

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,180
like last year and during all of these

00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:18,950
shows are the same there's like a kid on

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,380
a school field trip finds a dead body

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,000
next to a lake then there's an hour of

00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,010
the two police detectives arguing about

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,960
who gets the coffee with a lot of like

00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:30,020
flying shots of whatever city they're in

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,450
and then during then there's a flashback

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,850
to the murder scene the producers always

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:37,250
find some cool music so this particular

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:40,160
episode they flashback to the murder

00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,170
scene was set to child in time by deep

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,760
purple and I personally have never heard

00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,990
the song before I just recognize the

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,570
singer's voice and knew it was deep

00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:49,940
purple the next day I go into the office

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,800
and I have a colleague and she's from

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,010
Chemnitz so we always look up the Shazam

00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,320
chemnitz chart for the weekend and child

00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,830
in time by deep purple was number three

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,830
in the Chemnitz Shazam chart so I called

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,240
one of our data guys and I said oh can

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,400
you look up this song for me and he

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,320
comes back he's like it's very strange

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,900
typically this song is Shazam de Levin

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,110
times a day worldwide but on Sunday

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,460
night at 9:30 in Germany it was Shazam

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,650
27,000 times at the same int within the

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,640
same 10 seconds can he said can you look

00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:22,460
into why this might be

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:23,570
well it's poli-sci roof and people are

00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,270
actually Shezan in while watching

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,550
television and so that's why we created

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:32,150
this this product using the audio

00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:34,970
recognition so there are 38 million

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,210
tracks currently in the Shazam database

00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,930
and you know the average Shazam takes

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,690
around

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,910
three and a half seconds so that's

00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:46,699
across all the Shazam so there's 20

00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,650
million Shazam's a day worldwide out of

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,750
those 20 million Shazam's the average is

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,490
three and a half seconds so the way we

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,949
do that is we actually put the songs

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,560
into the database and assign them a

00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:59,750
track ID so that whenever you pull out

00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,990
your phone and you're listening it's not

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:05,509
actually listening for you know Phil

00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:07,850
Collins voice and land of confusion it's

00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:09,919
actually listening for that specific

00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,690
track ID that we have overlaid in our

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,990
database and so that's why it can detect

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,479
so quickly we can now do this with any

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,530
sound file so in this case we actually

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:23,780
did it with Magnum chocolate bars this

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,210
commercial this TV commercial

00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:29,180
I was running in four countries and it

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:31,310
was Shazam 260,000 times across those

00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,449
four countries mainly because of the

00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,560
song but I'm gonna play you guys the

00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:38,030
commercial and show you the user

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:40,699
experience so the commercial starts

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,360
playing I like the song I hit the Shazam

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,220
button

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,990
and it immediately recognizes that it's

00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,000
exact white song

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:50,950
but not the Jack white that I'm hearing

00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,470
on the radio this version has been hit

00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,080
shifted and it has been assigned its own

00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,750
unique ID so that it knows to match it

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,210
to the commercial not to Jack white

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,800
played on the radio and then we built

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:05,590
this custom experience instead of the

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,790
standard suzanne tacky so this is how we

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:10,720
connect

00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:14,150
[Music]

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,720
so that's how we do it for TV and using

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:19,550
the same type of audio recognition we

00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,010
can take the sound files from any sort

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,480
of radio commercial or any sort of radio

00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,650
product one of the things that we're

00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,510
actually doing with several radio

00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,280
stations here in Germany is we will

00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,950
create pitch shifted versions of songs

00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:34,040
for select radio stations so that if you

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,470
are Shazaam in the Depeche Mode that's

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:40,010
being played on radio zebu and oome you

00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:42,140
go to the radios even web page instead

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:46,220
of getting the standard Depeche Mode tag

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:48,440
result this is actually a video of a

00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,290
campaign we did for par ship de and

00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,410
Austria this is good because it shows

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:58,130
you kind of how we can tie video online

00:08:54,410 --> 00:09:00,230
mobile video to radio so we created a

00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,880
video that we could tie to this audio

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,190
file so whenever the app here's the

00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:07,250
audio file it immediately takes you to a

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:09,230
synced video so that you can see the

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,750
person who's speaking more and more

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,870

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,220

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:21,110
this accurately radio spots were

00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,670
ok so you guys get the joke but this

00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,220
actually was very difficult for our team

00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,350
to be able to sync the audio so we had

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,450
to actually sync the audio file mid

00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:19,820
files because not everyone Shazam's at

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,550
the same point in in the audio file to

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,000
the video that was very difficult for

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,380
our team

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,480
actually accomplished and we've run

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,490
similar campaigns three times now so

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,350
this is it actually does work but our

00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:33,380
team always complains to me when we do

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,420
stuff like this this campaign actually

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,190
is also using audio recognition but it

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:38,710
uses it a little differently so I was

00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:41,690
talking about how we have to have a

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:44,570
pre-recorded version of something so

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,690
this actually won the German media award

00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:49,970
for best brand' experience and this was

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,400
for Les Paul I'm gonna show you a video

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,470
but I'll just explain it so Swedish

00:10:52,400 --> 00:11:00,170
metal guitar player Bjorn jallat had his

00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:02,930
own Les Paul guitar and he wrote his own

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,750
guitar solo and you had to prove your

00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,280
skill in order to buy his guitar so let

00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,880
me show you this it explains a little

00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,880
better than I just did

00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:12,860
oops

00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,110
well I guess the video is not working so

00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,630
I'll continue to explain it so we

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,100
created we created these these in-store

00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,870
displays that would have the music

00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,290
written and you would have to actually

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:26,180
Shazam yourself you would have to

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,310
actually Shazam yourself playing the

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,010
guitar solo and only have you played

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,080
perfectly enough would it then give you

00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:36,020
the website to preorder the guitar or

00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,360
have a chance to win so it was quite

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:42,200
difficult but in order to set this up

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:46,070
but you Angela himself had to play the

00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,900
guitar solo 200 times with 200 different

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:50,540
guitars and different setups and we had

00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,370
put like I think it was like 800

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,560
different versions of the of the solo

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:57,410
into the database because we didn't know

00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:00,080
if you were what kind of amp you were on

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:03,650
or what kind of guitar you were using so

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,660
we had to put in a ton of these audio

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:10,280
files just to be able to match the

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:12,260
correct one so that is the audio

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,910
recognition what people don't know is

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,760
because we have this big database with

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:20,540
38 million files and we've become sort

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:22,670
of this ever-present recognition app we

00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,560
now have visual recognition so we

00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:26,089
created visual Shazam about a year and a

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,480
half ago and the products gone through

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,220
some changes since it released in beta

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,470
but basically we can make any sort of

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,840
printed material shiz aníbal by putting

00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,330
that printed image in our database

00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:42,770
and it works similar to how we've done

00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:44,720
with audio files so this next example is

00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:49,760
actually one also here in Germany that

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:53,500
we did with service plan for skylight

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,000
point de and InTouch style magazine we

00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:58,640
hijacked the entire magazine to turn

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,120
into a style I'd point de catalog so let

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,300
me see if this one sty light is Google

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:10,220
fashion the one place where you find

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:13,100
everything to prove this we hijacked a

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,400
whole fashion magazine with the fashion

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:18,110
Mac hi jack

00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,570
we put an ad in the front part of a

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:23,750
popular fashion magazine telling readers

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:27,350
that with a new visual function in the

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:35,180
Shazam up they could conveniently scan

00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:37,510
any page with fashion and instantly get

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,430
the items through sty light

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,170
this is how we did it we bought the

00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,380
magazine in the first second after

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:47,769
release and within one hour scanned

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,379
every fashion page

00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:54,069
created stylet URLs with matching

00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:57,160
products and linked both in the Schism

00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:59,170
database with a single ad we turned a

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,660
whole magazine into words dye letters

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,720
all about the most convenient shopping

00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,899
experience ever a dream come true for

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,079
every fashionista the issue became a

00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:13,929
best-seller literally with thousands of

00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:22,779
scans an average conversion rate of 38

00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:25,959
percent and 186 product sold out so yeah

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,489
we basically hijacked a magazine so

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,959
that's that's all stuff we've done in

00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:34,360
the past what's new for 2017 is now we

00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:36,610
kind of taken a different approach with

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,040
the visual recognition and we're now

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,329
using these codes and everyone always

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,720
asked me what's the difference between a

00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:46,029
Shazam code and a QR code the difference

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,119
is the QR codes no one has a QR code

00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:50,739
scanner there's 22 million people

00:14:49,119 --> 00:14:52,240
walking around Germany with Shazam app

00:14:50,739 --> 00:14:53,410
on their phone that can pull it out and

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,809
know to scan

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,230
Shazam code if they're given the correct

00:14:55,809 --> 00:15:01,540
call to action the other issue with QR

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:04,629
codes was that QR codes have been around

00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,379
since 2010 and in 2010 we weren't able

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:09,819
to give consumers good mobile

00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:12,369
experiences so whenever you had your

00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:14,230
first QR code experience you would go to

00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,629
some website that probably wasn't even

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,069
mobile optimized it probably wasn't

00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:20,529
designed for your phone so there was a

00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:23,049
really bad experience what we have now

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:25,480
is we have augmented reality experiences

00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:27,730
that can do things like this I see a

00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,290
Pepsi can I scan it using you see now

00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,779
this is the new home page from Shazam

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:35,949
with the camera function I scan it and

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:38,709
then it can take me to any sort of VR AR

00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:43,419
experience that you as a marketer would

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:45,220
want to have so this is actually Ash's

00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:46,720
amiable code so if you have Shazam you

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:51,639
can actually Shazam this it'll take you

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,790
to the BMW playlist this is also shows

00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:56,410
amiable this one is the first augmented

00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:58,779
reality campaign that we've done in

00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,740
Germany it's for Harry Styles does

00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:04,310
anyone here know Harry Styles he's the

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:06,050
One Direction guy okay wrong it's the

00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:10,040
wrong you're not 17 year old girls I

00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,930
will forgive you for that one but if you

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,260
look so here I'm gonna actually demo it

00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:19,580
so I have Shazam out I pull I pull up

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:23,260
the camera the camera I didn't test this

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:26,360
I hope it works the camera detects and

00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:30,590
now if I have enough data it's going to

00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,210
play the video so now I can watch his

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:35,990
music video against the wall so you see

00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:38,570
on my phone I have a music video and now

00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:40,160
I can play around with it so these are

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,870
the ways in which we can create user

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,750
experiences from this is actually a

00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:50,780
billboard that's hanging in Munich right

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:54,800
now I'll send I'll send it to you so you

00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,150
can play with it at home so this is one

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,220
that was live in the States this was

00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:59,720
actually a game that they created so if

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,190
you Shazam this it'll take you to a

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,630
little game to prove you're not drunk

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,670
and then if you can prove you're not

00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:07,339
drunk it'll give you six dollars off on

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,900
a bottle of tequila people people people

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:10,280
people always ask me if that's like a

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,580
big thing I'm like how do I know do I

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,260
look like I drink tequila so basically

00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:17,900
this was this was a big campaign that

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,580
beam did for for Cinco de Maya which is

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,620
the most important American holiday so

00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:23,900
that it's actually Cinco DeMayo is

00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:26,180
Mexican Independence Day and it's the

00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:28,880
excuse to eat tacos and drink too and

00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:31,790
drink tequila so this one was actually

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:36,890
very interesting it was the first a our

00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:40,370
campaign we did in the States it it

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:42,350
takes you to a 3d game other things

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,690
about Shazam so as we're continuing to

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,860
evolve the app is getting redesigned the

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,610
app the new redesign came out this is

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,400
what it looks like

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,510
we can now rebrand the the entire app so

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,650
these are the types of things if you're

00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,990
a developer you should always think

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,700
about what is the next thing not just

00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,670
like how can I can continue doing the

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,140
current thing one of the next things

00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,600
that we've done is we've launched a

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,880
snapchat partnership so you can now

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,820
actually Shazam music while taking a

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,290
snap how many people here have snapchat

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,530
okay again not 17 year old girls so

00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:19,190
sorry

00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:21,720
so so so we've currently doing 400,000

00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:23,970
Shazam's through snapchat a day just

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,140
here in Germany and the reason people

00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,090
say well why would we do this they're a

00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,710
competitor and the reason why we're

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:31,320
actually doing this is because if you

00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:34,710
saw our audiences actually adults are

00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:39,120
this this this function within snapchat

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,740
actually opens our our experience up to

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,340
new users that we currently wouldn't

00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,900
have and the thing that that our team in

00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:48,420
the States is most proud of is last

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:51,390
Thursday we launched the beach Shazam

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:53,610
game show that's hosted by Jamie Foxx it

00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:56,490
was the highest rated show on Thursday

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:58,440
night in the US and it's basically

00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,150
people or actually people are in teams

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:03,360
of two and they have to guess the song

00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:04,740
faster than Shazam for a million dollars

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,060
apparently somebody's already won a

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:11,880
million dollars by beating Shazam so

00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,890
thank you all very much I hope that this

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,220
was beneficial to you guys and you have

00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,820
any questions just to see me after

00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:24,779
[Applause]

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,779
