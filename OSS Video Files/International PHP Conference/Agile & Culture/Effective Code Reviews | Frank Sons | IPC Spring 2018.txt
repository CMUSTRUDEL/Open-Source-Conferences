Title: Effective Code Reviews | Frank Sons | IPC Spring 2018
Publication date: 2019-02-11
Playlist: Agile & Culture
Description: 
	Frank sons (Frank Sons - Agile Software & Code QualitÃ¤t): Code Reviews are a de facto standard for most teams. Either as a general four eyes principle, via pull requests, or as a real team meeting. Each and every one of these methods has their own pros and cons. Avoiding bugs is typically the main reason why code reviews are introduced, but how often do you really find serious bugs in your code reviews? This talk will give some insights into how to use code reviews as a method to establish a common understanding of code quality in your team. Using review tools is usually the second step in that process, after the developers have established a mindset for good quality.

[Music]

00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,210
still a lot of people here a lot of

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,269
people leaving already and it's I think

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,250
the last talk of the conference and it

00:00:14,269 --> 00:00:20,310
kind of scared me and also the bigger

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,230
room yeah we'll see

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,420
let you're still here I hope you enjoyed

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,990
the conference so far and I hope I can

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,050
yeah keep up the good stuff and I want

00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,000
to talk about coach abuse with you very

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,540
quick introduction about myself I'm

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,610
Frank

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,649
I'm from Hamburg there we say Moines

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:41,309
instead of hello and Moines doesn't mean

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:43,950
good morning it just means hello you can

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,320
give me any feedback via Twitter good

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:47,820
bad stuff if I screw up anything please

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,180
tell me because then I can do it better

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,199
next time if you liked it I liked it if

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,960
people like my stuff

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,120
and I'm also being a freelancer for like

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,730
two and a half years now and my main

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:06,150
focus has code quality sofa texture all

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:08,430
that stuff so question first why are you

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,820
here as anybody of you not doing code

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,960
reviews

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,380
oh there's true in the back l'amour oh

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,549
wait okay nice typically I will ask why

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,400
not but I think that a little bit to a

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,920
room too big for that important thing

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,750
and will not talk about any tools I will

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,430
mention some of them but there's not a

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,950
talk about tools for code reviews I

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,799
don't really care about the tools we'll

00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,720
see you see later why so if you're

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,670
expecting anything like oh I need the

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,409
perfect tool for code reviews I'm very

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,150
sorry I think that's another talk right

00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:48,750
next store if that's more interesting

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:52,649
for you but the good news who of you

00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,170
doesn't know Jeff Edward who of you

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,360
doesn't know Stack Overflow he's the guy

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,100
who wrote it

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,990
it was placing phone about two guys and

00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,180
one of them was coding that was him and

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,799
the other guy was just yeah it's a good

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:07,390
idea and we do it together more or less

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,800
but a still get right guy

00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,650
he wrote it the first version of the

00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,180
golf law was written by him alone and

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,060
she has an ice block coding horror it's

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,660
very good source of information of good

00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,180
stuff and good renting and I totally

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:24,740
agree with the statement that peer code

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,110
reviews are the single best thing you

00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,790
can do to improve your code no matter

00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:32,240
the outcome no matter what I will talk

00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,550
about being more effective or not do

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:41,540
code reviews it's better than not doing

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:43,550
them so I want to talk about two things

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,380
it's very small agenda I want to talk

00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,420
about the status quo how most people do

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,190
code reviews and then I will see okay

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:53,420
what's wrong with that and how can we

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,160
make it more effective and better if I

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,110
do it in smaller rooms of a smaller

00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,450
group people I will typically ask them

00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,239
how they do that but I think we will

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,750
skip that for now because otherwise that

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,610
conference will take a little bit longer

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:10,190
so coming to a status quo of most

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:12,530
reviews disclaimer my personal

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,060
experience with companies with people I

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,670
worked with and companies that hire me

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,480
how most of them work and the problems I

00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,420
face there

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:26,269
you may have seen other problems or even

00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:28,160
less problems and that's okay well most

00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:34,810
of times there are code reviews of fun

00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:38,810
right looking at them and how ok

00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:42,890
hey it can be fun if you take it in the

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,910
fun way but it can be serious so the

00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,700
first thing I want to talk about is

00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,989
mindset you need for code reviews I will

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:49,459
talk about intention in behind code

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:52,220
reviews and the reliance of code reviews

00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,950
later but the first thing about mindset

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:58,760
how do you do your code with what's very

00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:03,739
important from that ooh a few likes to

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,250
be criticized it's interesting nobody

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:09,440
was showing up until raised my hand but

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:11,750
most people really don't like to be

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:14,390
criticized especially developers we have

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:18,680
a huge ego we put a lot of work into our

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:20,359
code we wrote that we spent maybe days

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,720
thinking about that how to do that and

00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,100
then

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,500
the co2 view someone comes around no I

00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,000
don't like that that's not good you have

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,580
no clue what I did there I mean

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,170
come on I spent days working on that in

00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,890
no time you don't like it and you tell

00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:36,800
me that's wrong uh-huh it it doesn't

00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,170
feel that good and two of you has known

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,070
this sentence like no that's not my code

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:45,110
I wasn't that not me he's not here he

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,370
has left the company I heard like what I

00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,080
don't know anything about that sorry I

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,690
did I didn't write that I would run

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,310
petticoat and you you you read it but

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,330
you read the part I didn't write so now

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,740
I don't care about that I didn't write

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,100
that

00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:03,110
yeah we try to push everything that

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,210
criticized us like finance finance but

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,980
explanation why we didn't do it why we

00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:10,480
did it like it was or why we're not

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:10,480
responsible for the stuff that's bad

00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,530
it's your choice

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,230
Jeff effort we gave a basically the idea

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:21,230
behind Stack Overflow they wanted to get

00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,060
people out there to write stuff and get

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,730
people to tell them what I do I'm bad so

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,050
yes it's your choice everybody has the

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,520
right and freedom to totally second

00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:31,460
private if you're doing your home

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,040
project in your basement nobody will

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,860
ever look at that it's completely okay

00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,060
if it's the worst code ever but if

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,500
you're working a company where other

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,290
developers are working in there you're

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,020
working your team it probably should at

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:48,590
least be a little bit better than that

00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:51,110
so think about who else use the code

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:54,410
read the code and maybe maintain the

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:56,360
code I'm not sure if I get this thing

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,100
right that's it's the thing I don't like

00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,630
it too much but like always watch your

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,130
code like if the maintainer will be a

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,130
psychopath who knows where you live

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:10,370
yet really can follow by and I kind of

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,780
agree but it's kinda harsh I like my

00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,820
people I like the people I work for some

00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:18,890
so badly I want to like the people that

00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:20,180
maintain my code as well coming to the

00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,500
intentions

00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:26,610
what is the intention why are you doing

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,470
coat abuse can any mean to anybody tell

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:31,010
me they know their team knows why they

00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,010
do in coat reviews

00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,800
okay most serious like I mean they're a

00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,790
lot of a colleague of mine when I showed

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,380
him that he asked their because I'm

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:46,440
narcissist I'm just like that

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:48,600
I like criticizing people fix box yeah

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,950
it's a very common answer but most teams

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,780
we don't even know what they do encoder

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:53,550
is because everybody is doing them and

00:06:51,780 --> 00:07:02,570
some guy at the conference taught me do

00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:05,160
them yeah like knowledge sharing

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:09,090
knowledge sharing everybody knows what's

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:12,260
going on yeah that's good so if you do

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,260
co true is what are you looking for

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:23,270
optimization probably looking for bugs

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:27,060
design decisions okay

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:28,770
maintainability a lot of some things are

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,210
easy to classify some of these things

00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,730
are okay they're open for discussion

00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,310
depending on my opinion your opinion

00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:37,590
other opinions but there's a very

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,080
interesting thing Microsoft did study in

00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,750
2012 and asked the development teams

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,910
okay what is your motivation for doing

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:48,540
code reviews and of course finally

00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:52,380
defects core improvements alternative

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,380
solutions knowledge transfer and some

00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,570
other stuff but the most interesting

00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,860
part is the result because they looked

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,240
at that okay what is really what's

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,500
really going on there what is really the

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,680
main benefit we get from our code

00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,540
reviews and yes defects is in there but

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,400
not in the first place anymore like code

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,950
improvements like small we have smaller

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,080
code improvements it's something the

00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:15,270
main benefit we get all of that like

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,750
improving the code better naming maybe

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:21,000
or something understanding the code it

00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,340
helps other people to understand what's

00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,590
going on really understanding the code

00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:27,000
in general social communication like

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,170
people talk to each other because I

00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,580
talked about how or do we want to do

00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:33,120
that so it improves the communication

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,840
was in a team and then yeah you can find

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,820
defects but

00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,260
probably unit testing or testing in

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,289
general as a better way to find defect

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,789
than code reviews a friend of mine who

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,440
worked at Apple for eight years as a

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,300
senior developer had a huge team and

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,779
said yes they do code reviews to find

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,120
defects but they have specialists

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,920
especially for that was a huge knowledge

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,710
and they do code review a completely

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,089
different matter than most of us to them

00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,560
they have a real intense process for

00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:01,710
that because they were writing software

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,910
for the operating system and of course I

00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,850
want to find the bugs before they go

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,760
live for website yeah

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,390
okay we deploy again or we roll back

00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,940
it's not very important other example I

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,740
mean if you're writing software for

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:20,700
airplanes you probably don't want to do

00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,200
update over-the-air right I think they

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,779
will do code review in a different style

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,000
and they will of course focus more on

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,370
defects and everything but for general

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,020
software the most important part you get

00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:35,339
out of code reviews is coding proof and

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:39,060
understanding so what about the relates

00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:43,460
in general do you fix anything you

00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:46,320
finally code right now or later

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,930
depends what about different opinions

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,100
you say my code that should be fixed I

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,100
say no I like it that way

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,910
yeah but it's like if I know that you

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,370
always criticize my opinions and I know

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:03,540
you won't

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:08,130
maybe I asked him next time to do my

00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:10,110
code review how successful are you

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,760
reviews okay you're doing reviews you're

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:15,810
doing stuff can you tell me how

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,870
successful they are do you say they are

00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:20,610
successful at how successful so it's not

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,020
successful means nobody's complaining

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,370
about them all right do we really know

00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:28,050
what's going on okay that's good

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,089
because most people are if I talk to

00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,589
companies and say how here Cody was

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:33,600
going yeah doing great

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,100
doesn't mean nobody complains or do you

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,500
know that they're effective that they're

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,600
really successful most of the time that

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:43,560
they are nobody complains right that's

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,360
good isn't it most of teams don't even

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,750
now they do code reviews and don't know

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,090
why they're doing and they

00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:52,090
them and don't know yeah do we get

00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:53,890
anybody infidel of that the thing and it

00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:56,080
helps in any way but they don't know

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,000
really in what way and for fixing right

00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,230
now later

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,610
sometimes I fix them sometimes they

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:06,910
don't fit them and then forget them

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:09,130
we'll see so what I also had was the

00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:13,600
example the result you get from coterie

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:14,830
normally are kinda based on experience

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,210
if you're experienced developers who

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,550
know much more what they're looking for

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,980
what might be problems for the future

00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:23,380
also the timing if I'm very busy with my

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,660
own project my own stuff and I get a

00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,640
really huge review on my table that's

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:30,370
that I don't have time for that I need

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,810
to finish the other stuff so maybe I

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,430
will if I have to do it I will maybe

00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:37,000
just take a quick look yeah look fine

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,530
thank you on the general motivation do I

00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,210
really want to do caught use to a lack

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,920
that guy do I really want everyone to

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,170
see you okay how much can I find with

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,460
them or yeah it's okay he always just

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:51,250
goes that's good stuff so it's okay so

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,290
basically good luck with that it's

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,930
really completely luck based and we

00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:59,950
don't know what we're doing there it's

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,390
better than nothing again so let's take

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:06,450
a look if we can make it more effective

00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:09,930
I need to take a quick look on my time

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:17,020
yeah that's fine

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:18,400
talking about the mindset again it's

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:20,320
actually a title of the first talk I

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,930
gave ever gave about code rivers leave

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,050
your ego at the door as a developer we

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,780
have this huge ego but if possible

00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:30,190
really forget it at the door go into a

00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,100
code review especially if you have a

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:35,050
meeting or sit together with people and

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,190
take it they're not criticizing yourself

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,690
that critted I'm the code they're

00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,910
criticizing what is going on the team

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,460
there might be reason beyond you that's

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,770
led to other bad code or the bad outcome

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,770
maybe there was enough pressure that you

00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:54,100
need to do it in a quick way and also

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,400
again a set behind refers that this was

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,570
all the idea behind Stack Overflow

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,940
attempt to be also in public embrace

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,650
such the idea why they wanted to

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,070
Overflow was like I didn't like all

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:07,830
these peach PB bort i didn't like extra

00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:10,390
exchange what was around at the time I

00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:12,190
think it's still around and that they

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,870
had like a paywall before that and like

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:17,410
they wanted to get people a platform

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:20,050
where they can go out ask people what

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,060
they're doing wrong and get other people

00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,460
to tell them what's wrong

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,250
so so they can improve they can learn

00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:31,540
from that and get people to really go

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:33,600
out and yet embrace the suck it's really

00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:36,160
hard if you are not used to that and

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,770
I've done code reviews people in

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,060
companies or was departments where we

00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,820
started the code review and available

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:47,410
sitting there okay come on tell me

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:49,090
what's wrong yeah it's quite a good

00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,500
start from that so if he doesn't like me

00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,500
it doesn't like me that I will tell him

00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,630
things see where he can improve it will

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,580
be hard but forget your ego it's not

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:03,220
about you it's about your code and try

00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:05,190
to learn from that anybody not heard

00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,280
about collective code ownership as a

00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:11,290
password or whatever I mean it's not

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,300
your code it's the code of your team

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,580
your team is responsible you want to

00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,990
share the knowledge you want to get if

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,520
you're going twist stick or leaving the

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:23,680
company you want to be others to be able

00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,000
to take over your code it's not like

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,470
your private code you're taking home

00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,750
it's like something you do for the

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:30,880
company for the customer and it should

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:36,310
not be like your ego should belong to

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:38,620
that so what I always like to do is like

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,610
team reviews most people do coder is

00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:46,480
like a pull request or at least on for

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:47,650
our principals team reviews are a very

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,720
good start to get all the people

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:54,730
together have such different opinions

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:56,170
and at least opinions clash most of you

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:57,820
probably have seen team reviews in the

00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,260
form that the guy who wrote the code

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,360
will explain the code or show off the

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,550
coach and tell other people I did that

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,530
and now he can tell me what I did wrong

00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,450
it very nice on a very good way if you

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,730
for example wrote an API and you want to

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,130
present this to a different department

00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,440
that we will use the API but if you're

00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,420
doing this within your team I

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,610
always do it a little bit differently I

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,590
pick someone else who has never seen the

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,250
coat before and he will explain the coat

00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:26,190
to all the other developers if he cannot

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,440
explain the code at that moment

00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:32,560
how will he fix the back half year later

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,360
if you need to check the code there's a

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,940
really nice way to figure out it's my

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,400
coat understandable is it really an

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,430
honest animal doesn't mean I understand

00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,550
what's going on but I understand why the

00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:48,460
coat is doing this when I ask people

00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,900
okay how's your coat recommendation a

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,640
lot of people say yes our coat is

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:54,100
self-explanatory you can always read

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,720
what's going on I don't really care too

00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,490
much about what's going on yes the coat

00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,590
should show me that but I want to know

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,490
why why did you do this method if you

00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:05,440
think about it when you do back fix and

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,850
or a hunting of bucking later on and you

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,560
obviously okay there's this method I

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,150
don't understand the method I understand

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,270
what it does but I don't understand why

00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:15,280
I did that it really looked strange and

00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:16,960
you sit down you don't know okay you ask

00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,820
him and then you remove it and figure

00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,940
out later on I know I know why he did

00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:23,730
that and these are the hot paths later

00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:26,260
on refining bugs and understanding coach

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:28,360
they are not about how we are doing this

00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:29,710
but why we're doing this why did we do

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,490
this workaround there's a reason behind

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,870
that and a team review with someone else

00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,840
who's never seen the coach has to

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:39,490
explain this to all the others helps

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,770
because we will easily figure out these

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,820
points where nobody knows what's going

00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:47,950
on it was fun because I'm usually

00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,880
motivating these meetings and if the

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:54,100
reader goes silent or goes quiet I was

00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,810
tell them please think loud because

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,490
you'll now start somewhere I want to

00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:59,680
know where because there's probably

00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:02,350
missing some information maybe just a

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,520
small document lying or maybe it's

00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,380
really confusing what's going on there

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,230
but these are the important part once

00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,360
you get stuck you want to know why and

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,530
it also really helps for a team to

00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,390
develop this common sense of code core

00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:17,920
team how do we as a team want to work

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,569
together we have different opinions you

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,569
want to be really you want to find any

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,730
small bug you or whoever I don't want to

00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:26,439
finger point for that don't really care

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,060
about finger or about code quality at

00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,440
all but we need to as a team

00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,660
we need to find a common sense that

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,820
common guideline coming around how we

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:39,190
want to work as a team because it's not

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:41,460
my code and your code it's our code so

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,350
coming to intentions

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,240
why are you reviewing your coach you

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,560
should at least try to figure this out

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,350
there's nothing I can answer for you

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:54,490
because every team might have a

00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:57,280
different intention for Apple for NASA

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,780
for Airbus whatever they probably have a

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,070
different intention while they're

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,890
revving the code because I really would

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:06,220
make sure there are no critical bugs in

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:09,100
there other teams might say okay we want

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,500
to make sure that it's fast enough

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,000
because we need performance there might

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,520
be multiple reasons I need to figure out

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,090
why does your team need or why is your

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,590
team doing code reviews and then you can

00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,450
also decide what are we looking for if

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:24,220
you know what we why we do this we can

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,810
decide what do we need to look for in

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:30,180
order to figure this out and in order to

00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:32,740
improve this can we make to the study

00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:35,500
the interesting part is when you figure

00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,700
out what you're looking for how much

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,620
understanding do you need for that for

00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,040
example for defects if you're not just

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:44,260
looking for syntax error you're looking

00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,490
for logical errors you need to

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,350
understand what's going on you need to

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,350
understand why this is being done if I

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,180
don't know why the code is written that

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,840
way I will never come up with an

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:58,120
alternative solution because yeah how

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,790
can I propose an alternative alternative

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,080
solutions to something to a problem I

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:07,150
don't understand share code ownership

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,400
also in order to be able to have someone

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,600
else take over my work next week he

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,330
should be able to understand what's

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,510
going on knowledge transfer is of course

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,450
the way but you get there and all the

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,480
others like defects are not even on here

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,370
finally defy highest thing but some

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,610
other stuff like code improvements the

00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:29,320
small ones they are right in the middle

00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:33,700
you don't need too much knowledge about

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:36,670
what is going on there - just make the

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,710
code nicer but to find alternative

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,100
solution to find bigger problems you

00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:42,840
need to understand it so

00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,090
if you want to do something like that

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,440
figure ways out how your team knows more

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:50,670
about the code how everybody is on the

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,500
same page and then you can also set how

00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,970
do we do code reviews if I know why I'm

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,190
doing them if I know what I'm looking

00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:59,220
for I can decide okay what the right

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:03,330
method who of you is doing code reviews

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:07,490
by a pull request who have used during

00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:10,590
Cody was in a different way okay couple

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:13,560
can someone just shout something how we

00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,630
are doing here programming okay it's on

00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,710
there a program is mainly code review on

00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:18,450
the fly if you have a four hour

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,420
principle you as always someone else is

00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:23,540
looking at it's good if you frequently

00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:27,150
switch paths if you always the same pair

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:32,610
it's not so much an effect any other

00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:35,460
ways to do code reviews okay at least I

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,930
can hear anything pull requests are

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,920
really nice especially with kids

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:43,860
nowadays what do we do if you have a

00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,860
really fresh new project we are stock

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,300
mutant a no code base so or maybe you

00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:49,770
are just starting it's not online yet

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:53,760
you're just developing your beta

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,320
building the basic stuff first for pull

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,680
requests you need feature branches or

00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:00,960
branches at least so do I create feature

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,110
branches now just a full of estrogen can

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,790
do code reviews there are tools out

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,390
there that can do if you want to use

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:11,040
tools you can do code use commit based

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,600
so even if you're doing trunk based

00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,790
development what I usually do when we

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,710
are just starting because it we don't

00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:18,030
have any conflicts we are not online yet

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,470
we don't need release branches or

00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:21,570
anything

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,700
there's carrot out there if you're using

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:26,070
a destined stake but you need it on

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,770
premise not on the cloud there's fish

00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:31,730
lion crucible there are a lot of tools

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:35,850
out there that can help you that are not

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:38,250
only for pull requests and also what

00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:41,010
about long live in feature bunches if

00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:43,800
your feature branch does like one or two

00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:45,980
weeks old I don't want to do the code

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,980
review

00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,910
yeah but basically you are you're doing

00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:59,169
this painting for careers right you're

00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:01,540
splitting up your feature branch into

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:05,350
smaller things Trev earlier Kochi was

00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:07,540
right so we are building our development

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,059
process in a different way because of

00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:13,059
our tools I personally don't like that I

00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:14,470
want to use tools that support my

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:17,919
development process and not the other

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,270
way around so there are other tools out

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,070
there that can help you having a

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:25,720
development process that is not relying

00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:28,299
on poulakis only I I like polar crest I

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,620
like pulling as code reviews but if

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:30,790
you're working a different way think

00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,140
about if there might be other tools that

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,850
can help you as well and make it more

00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,770
easily and more effective for that and

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,510
so that you don't have to screw around

00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,309
with your work process or development

00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:42,429
process just to be able to do code

00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:46,090
reviews peer programming who of you is

00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:48,429
doing peer programming about the half

00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:53,110
the other people do it it's great it's

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:54,460
awesome it's fun yeah nothing more to

00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,740
say about that would be in different

00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,419
topic and as I mentioned before code

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,370
review meetings there can be multiple

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:02,770
reasons why I want to do a meeting in a

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,870
bigger round is that before like if you

00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,730
want to have the team develop a common

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:09,820
sense or a common understanding of code

00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:11,350
quality it's the best way to start also

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:13,900
if you like want to present something a

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,549
great solution you found or you need to

00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,500
present it to a different Department of

00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:23,770
course a bigger meeting is perfect for

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:26,549
that I also like creating a coding

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:28,780
guideline it's not a coding style guide

00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:30,880
coding style guide is the things where

00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:33,160
where do I put a bracket tablets basis

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,010
stuff my IDE can tell me or can fix for

00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,380
me and my code is integration system can

00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:40,980
tell me if I did something wrong

00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:44,470
go guide on some other stuff that's not

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:49,270
possible to check by a tool they might

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:51,400
be a little bit not left concrete for

00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:53,919
example we can say we want to have small

00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,140
methods so we don't have these long big

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,910
weak methods I mess up where nobody

00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,440
knows anymore what's going on but you

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:01,030
may not want to put a number down there

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,100
like all our messed up need to be less

00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:05,679
than 50 lines of code because what do

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:07,270
you do if you have 51 is it okay then

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,630
not okay it might be the pen

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:12,520
on situation so it's kind of something

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:15,429
you cannot put into a tool but anybody

00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,920
as a human can look at this and say yes

00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:19,210
it looks okay so you have a guide on how

00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,370
you want to work together there's

00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,710
something the team needs to trade it

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,540
should not be given by like managers or

00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:27,490
just by one senior developer but the

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,900
team itself should decide what are

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,720
important things for us and this will

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,640
differ completely from team to team if

00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,530
you're working in a small Intel agency

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,179
that just put website out there for half

00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,429
a year you don't really care too much

00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:41,620
about maintainability and everything if

00:24:39,429 --> 00:24:43,809
you are in a finance sector building a

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:47,590
software for bank you probably have

00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:49,450
different views on code quality and what

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,150
is important for you and maybe even for

00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:53,170
security reasons and if the living

00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:55,900
document is not something your white

00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:57,250
ones and it's gone but if you do these

00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,540
meetings this code your meetings

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,220
regularly and you come up with something

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:03,940
oh we need to decide how we handle this

00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,260
you can put something in guideline very

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,330
important it should not be like a

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,760
20-page document it should be like maybe

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,350
a couple of items you have in there that

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,350
are very important for you it's not

00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:16,900
something we create a real overhead and

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,110
stuff but a small thing where everybody

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,820
knows this is how we want to work

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,860
benefit if any new developers comes in

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,970
he will already know we can take a look

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:30,100
at this and knows okay these are

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:35,920
important parts for our team and coming

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:38,530
to the results you should keep track of

00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:41,770
your slides if you don't fix it right

00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,420
now make sure your follow-ups either at

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,610
the meeting if you need to decide how do

00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,040
you want to fix it or maybe just create

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:49,420
a ticket so you don't forget it yeah a

00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,370
ticket can be forgotten as well I know

00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,540
but at least you have it in there and if

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:55,720
it's important enough it will come up

00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:58,420
again but it always kind of said if you

00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,800
say yeah wait we talked about this three

00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:02,559
weeks ago we want you to do that but you

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,790
forgot about that so make sure if you

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,790
find anything that important enough

00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:09,429
follow-up if you do this code review

00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,140
meetings it was like a group of couple

00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:13,690
of people I recommend not more than

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:16,750
seven people if you have moderator and

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:20,410
the one who wrote it more idealist like

00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:21,370
three four five people it's still

00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:23,020
important

00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:24,820
if you do this and you take a look at

00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:26,980
the code and find something and you have

00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:30,670
a discussion about how should we solve

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,110
this postpone the discussion you're

00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:35,740
doing the meeting because you're fine to

00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:38,140
want to find stuff I've seen meetings

00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,300
where like after 50 lines of codes I

00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:44,710
found the first big thing and they were

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:47,320
cussing about that like one hour but

00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,110
there might be a much bigger problem ten

00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,400
lines below that if you just discuss

00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:54,130
this one thing you don't know what else

00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:56,080
you would find so if you notice okay we

00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,390
need to discuss about that postpone it

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,160
make a follow-up meeting or whatever or

00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:02,140
just say okay we can talk about it

00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,270
afterwards and go on try to find more

00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:06,130
stuff you want to find stuff if it's

00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,870
just one liner were you maybe rename the

00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:10,270
variable you can maybe even do this

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:14,200
right on the spot but for anything any

00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:16,180
discussion postpone it it not within the

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,950
meeting otherwise we'll just have a lot

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:20,230
of cautions and everybody will sooner or

00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:22,000
later say these code review meetings are

00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,420
not really useful because we're only

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,890
discussing and yeah not everyone

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,330
everything needs to be fixed at once

00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,630
maybe you find something is more like an

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:34,420
architectural things or its technical

00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:37,030
depth and you don't want to fix it for

00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:38,830
the full request offices commit but you

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,720
know okay we need to take a look at this

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,310
and need to find a way how we solve this

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,110
maybe we even need to make a bigger

00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,820
story out of that and need to have a

00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,070
refactoring maybe we even need to get

00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,680
some consultants in house to help us

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,120
fixing this problem whatever it's okay

00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,440
but you found it and that's good because

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:58,930
now you know you have a problem there

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:01,390
and for these guidelines they're nice

00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:03,040
for this I mean a checklist sounds like

00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,740
very formal and now we want to do stuff

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,840
but for example you can if you have a

00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,280
small guideline was five or ten items on

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,590
there you can make a very quick

00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:13,420
checklist everybody can use for the code

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,550
review and can say yes we did record

00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:18,250
review and we agreed on these things and

00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:20,430
yes I checked them if you do it as a

00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,660
real report or as a real document

00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,610
doesn't matter it might be just okay

00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:25,750
these our guidance is our checklist for

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:27,910
the coach of you if you do a code review

00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:31,960
please make sure that these Gardens are

00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:33,910
followed even any new developer can do

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,960
that normally if a new developer comes

00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:37,390
into a company

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,010
his code will be reviewed but he was not

00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:41,080
doing the good reviews because it's not

00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,520
too familiar with how we work if you

00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,500
have this guide and check this you can

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,000
say you can do a coat you were here and

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,500
you can use this check there this and

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,450
you already know how we are working you

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,210
know what you're looking for you know

00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,670
what's important for us and if you have

00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,410
customers or like legal responsibility

00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,720
to make sure that you cut the error code

00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:01,570
applies to whatever standard you can

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,230
even create reports out of them I would

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:06,670
not recommend that for any normal team

00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:08,320
but if you have reason for that maybe

00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:11,410
for management of forever you can use

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,570
that to even say okay we are working on

00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:16,150
code 40 we are looking for these things

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:20,230
every time so all our code follow these

00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:22,330
guidelines and no matter if I ask you or

00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,770
if I ask someone else they all agree to

00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,690
that so we all look for that

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:27,780
so this luck factor and how much you're

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:30,760
invested in there it's at least reduced

00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,680
of course if people don't follow this

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:38,710
the guidelines while they do the code

00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:41,950
review that's another problem and yeah

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,540
also to do miss pasta slide so if you

00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:48,190
write it down if you keep track of

00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:49,450
things you can improve if you just think

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:52,840
you're doing stuff and you're not sure

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:54,280
and yeah maybe we're doing this and

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,080
maybe he's doing that maybe he's not

00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,850
doing that it's just like place so if

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,560
you write stuff down if you focus and

00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:03,940
find out what's really going on it helps

00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:06,490
you being more effective and that small

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,660
as the end already in order to make your

00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,310
reviews more effective

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,370
forget about your ego leave it at the

00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,980
door it's not about you and also very

00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,210
important if you're the reviewer it's

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:18,220
not about the other person don't

00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,260
criticize a person like what did you do

00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,390
there but why did you do that can you

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,370
explain this to me and this is really a

00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:27,130
good idea but don't criticize the person

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,770
do not finger-pointing if you remember

00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,050
the slide was the result from the study

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,370
there was no thing in there that like

00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:34,960
finger-pointing was the reason we did

00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:38,290
that our finger pounding was our

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,670
motivation if you do finger pointing and

00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:43,060
we're used to have a big problem and it

00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:44,500
will even be worse because people will

00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,990
not like Ravus anymore if they get

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:48,140
blamed for that public shaming is not a

00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:50,800
good idea for that

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:53,150
you want to find stuff to make it better

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,500
have a guideline as team create

00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:58,220
something figure out what you're looking

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,600
for and why you're doing that and figure

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,430
out what are the most important part for

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,250
you as a team that you need to take care

00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,040
of and all the stuff you can automate

00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,450
automate them and follow up on your

00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,340
results like if you're doing all these

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,350
meetings and find a lot of stuff but

00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:17,000
don't really care about them after one

00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:21,230
week it's not that helpful anymore well

00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:23,810
no matter what even if you don't like

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:26,570
all the stuff please do code reviews on

00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,640
anyway it's better if you do it more

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,520
effective but coaches are really really

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,050
useful at the best thing you can do to

00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,470
get some communication your team to talk

00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,940
with other people to get other opinions

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,880
me personally that were I mention in the

00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,320
beginning I love to get feedback from

00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,910
our slide from our talks for whatever

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,500
because I know when someone tells me

00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,990
that wasn't good I can improve for the

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,870
next time same for coach same for

00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,400
architecture for anything you do if you

00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,930
once you get over this like it's been

00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,020
I'm getting criticized and it's still

00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,420
hard I agree in that but it's also a lot

00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:02,660
of fun I will never do an architecture

00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:05,420
or what be a code without review if I

00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:08,030
write in or like a doing architectural

00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:09,320
design or a vision or concept and I give

00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,880
it to people who and the company who

00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,370
have maybe more experience on what

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,350
domain and tell them take a look at this

00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:18,530
please give me feedback what's wrong

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,270
here what can be improved and nobody

00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:23,800
tell on LA all day off they yeah I look

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:26,480
fine it's good I get really nervous

00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,070
because I know I'm not perfect I know

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,570
there are stuff in there Kimi improve

00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,970
especially they are the doing domain

00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:33,830
experts and either they didn't take a

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,060
look at that and didn't have time didn't

00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:36,730
have any motivation to take it at this

00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:39,080
or as I did all I didn't find anything

00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,760
and I didn't find anything that might be

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:44,270
there are some bigger stuff hidden in

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,490
there and then I get nervous so really

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:48,410
get out there enjoy I enjoy having

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,300
people criticize you it with a lot of

00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,360
fun and you can learn a lot of a lot

00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:56,899
from that and yeah

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:59,119
at the end I'm not sure how at the time

00:32:56,899 --> 00:33:02,559
but thank you first of all and any

00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:02,559
questions feedback whatever

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:11,359
[Applause]

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:26,470
questions I know it's late and everybody

00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:28,720
wants to go at home so ah okay how do I

00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:31,990
handle code reviews with mixed teams

00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,020
front and back-end right typically we

00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:37,179
are accession in PHP world most PSP

00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:39,880
developers can with JavaScript and most

00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:41,529
JavaScript front-end lakhan with PHP so

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,559
they are perfect for being the reader

00:33:41,529 --> 00:33:46,720
for the different code reviews a

00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:48,909
JavaScript guy can read PHP stuff and

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,399
the PHP des can read JavaScript stuff

00:33:48,909 --> 00:33:53,679
they don't have to understand all the

00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:55,870
technical details maybe for a framework

00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:01,510
or whatever score being used there but

00:33:55,870 --> 00:34:03,370
they are or should be able to understand

00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:04,960
what's going on there and it even more

00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:06,070
interesting because as I'm not so

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,320
familiar with the language and was

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:15,040
frameworks they may ask you big question

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,330
and nobody else would ask yes because

00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,859
there might be complete different

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,179
reasons like for security stuff in the

00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:21,940
back end is completely different to

00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:23,710
something in the front end whatever is

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,599
necessary I don't have like you always

00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,669
should have this guidance but figure out

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,990
what it's important for you and some

00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:33,510
stuff might be front end some software

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,510
to back end yeah

00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:50,870
okay the question was who reverse the

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,480
code is obvious was in the team or made

00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,280
from different teams depends if you have

00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,840
a small team and I've seen teams like

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,730
was two or three people where everybody

00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:00,410
says yeah we all know the code so who

00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:02,360
should be the reader a written for

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,070
example it's very nice if you have

00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,510
different teams you can ask them can you

00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,070
play the reader for us and we play the

00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:10,010
reader for your team's because then you

00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,840
get knowledge sharing across teams even

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,280
in bigger companies like completely

00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,900
different teams there I've worked in the

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,490
game industry and rather games and they

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:18,260
were developing different browser games

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,150
but it was still fun to have like

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,070
different opinions and how do you do

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:23,930
that can you explain this to me because

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:27,950
they're not familiar was how we handle

00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:29,300
stuff if the team is big enough I would

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,800
always pick someone from the team so we

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,330
have the knowledge sharing and this all

00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:34,430
information was in your team if the team

00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,430
is small smaller and you don't have

00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,980
people in your team who can are not

00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:42,590
involved in this code try to get someone

00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:45,050
else from different team it can be used

00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,500
really as a way to get more interaction

00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:49,970
and more communication between teams

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,980
they are if they are like a front-end

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:54,110
team in a back-end team the same applies

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,580
what I've just said for mixed teams you

00:35:54,110 --> 00:36:02,500
can just pick some often front-end team

00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:02,500
all of begin' team for us there

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,200
okay the question was like how to handle

00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,790
complex features that are already or

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,220
that take a long time to develop and

00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:39,660
stages or not okay

00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:42,900
I doing development a job do you do at

00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:45,330
your iterations it's a feature one

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,520
iteration or one spin don't move towards

00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,530
friends

00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:54,480
okay so you're breaking a JJ idea

00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:57,090
already I know I mean did now just took

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,130
the ideal world it would not happen but

00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:03,900
in the practical world it happens I

00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:05,670
would try if you do pull request code

00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,310
reviews you can only do it at the end

00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:10,050
right or you doing splitting up that I

00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,600
prefer other tools that let me come here

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:14,970
if I have a small working status I can

00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,730
do a full code review for small status

00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:21,150
and another tool so we do code reviews

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:23,430
in between and if it's a very important

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,290
module for example like payment lock in

00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,300
process or something I will use these

00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:29,400
for the meetings because I don't want to

00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,770
use any here boring code in these

00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,360
meetings but I want to have very

00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,470
important modules code within this

00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:38,130
meeting so we can share the knowledge

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:40,260
about that process if we like talk about

00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:42,270
the developer the payment process or the

00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,820
log in module was in our meetings where

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:46,200
all the developers were present the next

00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,030
time someone asks we have a back in

00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,100
there nobody can say that's not my code

00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,660
I've never seen it we've all seen it we

00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,250
all talked about that so we should all

00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,840
be able to understand it and this is

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:59,250
very important for the important code

00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:01,560
and for controller typically not so but

00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:04,590
I would split it up and try to do

00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,540
reviews and small steps because if you

00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,330
have like large feature was like 25 for

00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:11,550
review I don't want to do the review

00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:13,800
because yeah then you really take either

00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:15,570
a long long time or you just fly over

00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,020
all the stuff and say I looked okay down

00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,020
thank you

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,410
there was another question behind you

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:33,310
again the last word too much what am i

00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:43,960
exceptions could hear too much a polo

00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:45,820
crest depends on the situation we have

00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,500
typically we have like these for our

00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,390
principal someone else needs to review

00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,340
the code and we have to squadron

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,240
meetings but for our principles like we

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:53,410
if you have this checked as this

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:56,590
guideline we know what we are looking

00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,880
for at least are fulfilled it's okay but

00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:59,410
most of the teams we don't work don't

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,990
just work with pull requests so and full

00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,730
access depending on the team has worked

00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,050
with different customers depending like

00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,210
there might be other things that are

00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:08,470
involved like we want do we do what do

00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:10,840
we want to merge because that might

00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,150
trigger deployment so even if the pull

00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,310
request is like ok it's ok we can do it

00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:18,730
we will not merge directly maybe for

00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,050
reasons also of course I want to have

00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:22,869
continued integration that checked all

00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:24,880
my stuff everything green are there unit

00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:28,660
testing other unit tests are the new

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,930
unit tests for the new code code sniffer

00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:34,359
stuff or as my sonar Q saying everything

00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:35,859
is ok it depends on the team so it's

00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:37,720
hard to give a concrete answer for that

00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,430
because it really depends what am I to

00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:46,900
what I'm using there and how much I am

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:52,210
looking at stuff I don't know we need

00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:54,400
one no not mine we I don't I don't like

00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:57,070
neither me nor anybody else being the

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,440
one guy who approves anything it's a

00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:01,960
team thing it's a job you need someone

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,670
else you need someone else you need a 4i

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,780
principle you need yourself and you need

00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,940
someone else who looked at that and said

00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:09,940
it's ok someone else one team I don't

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:11,560
care who it is a talk was another friend

00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:12,580
of mine about that before and he asked

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,910
me what do you think about stuff like

00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,280
that

00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:16,690
there are reasons for example you have

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,760
someone else who's the only guy who

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,280
really knows about certain security

00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:23,109
staff or certain regulations and he

00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,450
needs to give an approval there might be

00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:27,030
a situation that is feasible in most

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,170
other case it looks to me like someone

00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:32,300
wants to control the stuff that's

00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,710
happening take a look at if I was been

00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,850
after that the team lead can you please

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,360
take a look at all the commits that

00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:39,770
people are doing no I declined that

00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,170
because no I'm not controlling

00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:44,900
developers if they have a guy that if

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,100
they know how to work together they can

00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,450
check it for each other they don't

00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,740
control each other it's not about finger

00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,770
pointing finger or do you do anything

00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,450
wrong it's just about I know I'm

00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:55,780
developing something and I need someone

00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:58,190
else take a look did I miss something

00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,050
but if it's one centralized person it's

00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,250
not my job if I'm a team leader or

00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:04,910
something I'm not it's not my job to do

00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:06,230
code reviews if I'm coming to a company

00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:07,670
and they ask me can you please do a code

00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,870
review to figure out where our problems

00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:11,360
are and what we can do better maybe

00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:13,610
architecture wise or something yes but I

00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:16,040
will not do every any code or all pull

00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:19,400
code reviews for pull requests another

00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:23,480
inspector I'm not a controlling people I

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:25,250
don't like that at all so the team it's

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,900
an HR team they should work together

00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,970
they should all know what they are doing

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,440
what they're looking for and they should

00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:36,220
be able to do the code review by

00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:36,220
themselves any other questions

00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,190
should Scott use for pull across always

00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,650
done in person or is enough why all the

00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,810
tools for that I would just use the

00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:54,540
tools and once you find something talk

00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:56,010
to each other it was better if there are

00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,780
remote teams it's not possible anyway

00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:59,340
but it's always better to have if you

00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,350
find something right now sure how you

00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,850
want to handle it then talk to each

00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:05,520
other if you find something or you

00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:07,770
forget something here it's easy can

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,840
please do that also question follow-up

00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:12,090
if I found something and tell you please

00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,160
fix that will I do another code review

00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:19,200
after you fix it or do I trust you to

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,730
have done their ideal world you should

00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,980
trust each other that way that people

00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:25,200
will not ignore that if we have the

00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:26,790
problem that people who ignore stuff

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,350
that people found on a code review you

00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:31,410
have a different problem your problem

00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:31,920
your team I would always say do it in

00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:34,410
person

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,630
or if you find something that needs to

00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:38,370
be discussed maybe even ask the whole

00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,080
team because not only you - I have a

00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:43,470
problem with that I need to decide that

00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:44,820
but if it's just something here make

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:47,190
your mark I usually use a tool and say

00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,680
here this needs to be fixed maybe think

00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,210
about naming or whatever that's okay I

00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,320
do not need to do that in person I would

00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,000
never because it would take too much

00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,610
time if you do pair programming you're

00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,230
already doing this in person as I said

00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,580
before was for our principles even with

00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:03,080
pull requests if you're done it and pair

00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:05,250
programming it's already okay for us

00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,820
because we had someone else looking at

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,370
that I now for example Google has some

00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:13,050
really strict guidelines for coach being

00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:15,120
checked in you need to be certified for

00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:16,260
the language at least it was a couple of

00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,520
years back then I don't know why all

00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,830
right now you should be certified for

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,360
the language you need to have like you

00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:26,730
need to be certified or a lot for this

00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,140
part of the code and I forgot the third

00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:29,460
one what better you need to have these

00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,640
guys or someone else

00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:35,490
whose lives or guidelines to be able to

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:37,230
review a code there were some they have

00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:38,730
the more strict guidelines for that so

00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,390
it's very interesting because I have a

00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:44,610
huge code base and base again invading

00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,380
everybody can commit code where -

00:43:44,610 --> 00:43:48,210
everywhere so they need to come up with

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,890
some guidelines but still they're just

00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:53,550
having 4i principles as you find someone

00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:55,809
else who yeah who is allowed to do so

00:43:53,550 --> 00:44:07,040
it's okay

00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:08,750
any other questions yeah what are you

00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,880
doing if you're coding alone and you're

00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,099
a freelancer I'm a freelancer and I'm

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:17,000
really glad that a downside myself as a

00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:19,520
code monkey because I like to know it I

00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,839
know a lot of people and freelance

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,690
developers who were just working on

00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:25,160
their own and I wouldn't like that

00:44:23,690 --> 00:44:27,799
I don't think they're doing a bad job

00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,849
something I don't like that I like to

00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:31,609
work in teams I like to work those

00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:33,290
people and I know I will make mistakes I

00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:34,819
mean I do this sometimes and I still

00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,990
want someone if I'm working for custom I

00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,970
have someone from the customer side

00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:39,710
maybe take a look at this place but I

00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:42,200
will not merge if I were working was

00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:44,329
full at first I did it as a favor for a

00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,040
company in Hamburg a couple of weeks

00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:48,770
back I always asked the developer

00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,540
in-house please you do the merge even if

00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:52,099
I could do it you do the merge take a

00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:55,250
look at this because I might have missed

00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:57,530
something so as a lead someone else is

00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:01,010
taking a look at that if you're really

00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:03,079
purely working on your own find a

00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:05,059
co-working space find people who are

00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:07,760
freelance developers as well talk to

00:45:05,059 --> 00:45:11,630
each other so you want to get you can

00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,359
get feedback I am if I'm not a customer

00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:15,589
I'm usually at a co-working space I have

00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,119
other people here who are freelance

00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:19,099
develop a storefront and whatever who

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,109
are mainly working alone at least I have

00:45:19,099 --> 00:45:22,309
some communication knowledge sharing

00:45:21,109 --> 00:45:24,140
about stuff going on

00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:26,839
it's not always just code reviewing but

00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:35,210
I need people to tell me if I'm doing

00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:36,260
stupid stuff yeah if you wait long

00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:37,910
enough it's not your code name and it

00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,170
depends if you if you have a customer

00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:40,730
you should hopefully have someone else

00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,559
who can take a look at that and if

00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,540
you're just waiting for your own use to

00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:45,710
stuck with your code but you will

00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,290
probably learn from that if you take a

00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:50,480
look at that later on they are I would

00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:52,640
if I if I really unfortunate that I

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,030
would at least use as much tools to

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,619
study code analyze as possible it will

00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:59,450
not find all the stuff I mentioned but

00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:00,980
it will help you even at least get a

00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:04,880
little bit better feeling for that

00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,829
that's about the duration general any

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,220
last question I think time is nearly

00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:09,220
running out

00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,080
yes the question is if there differences

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:25,580
between code reviews and autumn sauce

00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:28,250
and in normal project within team a lot

00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:30,500
of open source project rely on pull

00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,270
request and they review that not only

00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:34,280
based on that coding standard and if

00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,950
it's okay but also do we want to have

00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:40,610
the feature in here so they will not

00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:42,470
allow the normal developer to push code

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:45,860
into their main repository for reasons

00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:47,570
because ya know we we are on sauce you

00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:50,870
can contribute but we take a look at

00:46:47,570 --> 00:46:52,790
this and decide for maybe strategical

00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:54,740
reasons or whatever if we really want to

00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:57,650
have that in here so the need to have a

00:46:54,740 --> 00:46:59,870
code review not only based on the code

00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:02,570
alone but on the future and what the

00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:06,830
future provides so yes that's a

00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:10,130
difference and they are remote by

00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:12,260
default so they cannot use the tools and

00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,850
like they cannot do a Quadra meeting but

00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:15,350
a lot of coding standards everything

00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:17,180
came out of open source products because

00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:18,620
of these reasons because I agreed we

00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,360
need to agree on something because we

00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,620
are in different locations we are

00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:23,870
working all on this big project together

00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:25,400
and we don't know each other so we need

00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:29,960
to come up with guidelines so it rules

00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:33,050
how we want to work together ok I think

00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,700
we're over the time now thank you again

00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:38,360
if if any feedbacks talk to me later

00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:40,610
sent me via Twitter or something and if

00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,140
you're staying enjoy Berlin enjoy the

00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:45,480
workshop tomorrow and otherwise maybe

00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:51,640
see you next year Munich

00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:51,640
