Description: 
	Frank sons (Frank Sons - Agile Software & Code Qualit√§t): Code Reviews are a de facto standard for most teams. Either as a general four eyes principle, via pull requests, or as a real team meeting. Each and every one of these methods has their own pros and cons. Avoiding bugs is typically the main reason why code reviews are introduced, but how often do you really find serious bugs in your code reviews? This talk will give some insights into how to use code reviews as a method to establish a common understanding of code quality in your team. Using review tools is usually the second step in that process, after the developers have established a mindset for good quality.
