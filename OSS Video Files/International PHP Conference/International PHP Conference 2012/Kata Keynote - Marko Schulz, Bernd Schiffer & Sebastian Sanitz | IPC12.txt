Title: Kata Keynote - Marko Schulz, Bernd Schiffer & Sebastian Sanitz | IPC12
Publication date: 2013-05-10
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2012
Description: 
	Übung macht den Meister! Das weiß jeder Sportler, und seit den Softwarecraftsmen wissen es auch immer mehr Programmierer. Katas (jap. 形, übersetzt "Form") haben einen coolen japanischen Namen, kommen aus den asiatischen Kampfkünsten und wurden in der Übertragung auf das Programmieren als Coding-Katas populär. Marko Schulz, Bernd Schiffer und Sebastian Sanitz von it-agile führten diese Übungsform live auf der IPC 2012 vor und erklärten, wie jeder Teilnehmer selber sofort in der Session auf seinem Laptop mit einer Kata starten kann!

welcome to our keynote on kutta if

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,970
you're wondering what cutters are or

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:21,359
what cutter is what for it is what is

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,279
for what is for well if you if you take

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,460
one thing out of this session then

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,949
please memorize this meme it says

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,560
cutters let's let you internalize basic

00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:33,980
steps so we you will use them

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,110
subconsciously while programming and

00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:40,739
that's all about now we are ready we

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,300
were done okay no it's no not really we

00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,640
have to explain one as they want to see

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,890
the karate yeah yeah yeah we have a

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,180
karateka yeah I don't be afraid don't we

00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:54,360
don't with the karate so cutters are

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,250
basically about well learning and a

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,980
special way of learning learning by

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,910
repetition so learning by repetition is

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:05,189
a well-known concept and well you see

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,450
this guy this is not what we mean by

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:11,820
learning by repetition what we mean is

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,520
doing the same thing over and over again

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,070
so you will be better each time you

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,720
practice it until you master that thing

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,880
that's the basic concept of a cutter and

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,330
well there are different different

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,250
things you can you can well practice so

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,479
for example have you ever played guitar

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,299
or an instrument well I I hated my first

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,970
steps when I when I when I began this so

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:41,369
when you when you want to make a sound

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,880
on a gita you have to block those

00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:48,210
strings here okay sure obviously and it

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,869
should sound differently so you want to

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,000
make a note so you you hit in this bar

00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,189
that different bars and you hit this

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,829
string and then you can make another

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:02,159
sound you won't hear a sound it's it's a

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:04,920
silent guitar so I yeah so but the idea

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,129
is clear right so if you want to have

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,069
well different sounds other sounds you

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:12,520
not only have to hit once a one spring

00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:14,850
you have to hit several

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:18,610
strings so for example this is a G chord

00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:22,180
okay see my finger pattern here yeah

00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,100
well when you start this it's very very

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,380
stressful because you have to remember

00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,570
well I have to have to put this finger

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,740
here and I have to put this finger here

00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:34,660
and then I somehow managed to put my

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,170
index finger here and then you have a

00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:41,650
cramp ok so that's how you start playing

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:46,180
the guitar basically with lots of cramps

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,820
in your left hand ok so and now when you

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:50,050
practice this over and over again

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:53,620
thousands of times then you're actually

00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:56,560
able to do this in one single stroke

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,630
with no problem you always hit it ok I

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,510
don't have to have to don't have to look

00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:05,620
no I have to but well basically I don't

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:08,020
have to ok so it's it's memorized ok so

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,170
that's one part where you can practice

00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,420
all over again and you really do that

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,600
all the time when you play Gita and then

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,980
actually people want to listen to you

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,470
yeah that's why I brought a silent

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,140
guitar they don't serve they don't have

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:26,740
to listen to you right so another

00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:29,709
another well another thing where you

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,840
practice all the time is dancing you

00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:34,150
know how you came and she did a lot you

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,880
did a lot of friends I did ask with my

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,850
wife I did only is very little because

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,560
I'm not a good dancer yeah yeah yeah we

00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:43,360
can we can so you know the difference

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,790
between an extrovert program and

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,820
introverted programmer it is yes I know

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,500
so what is it I'm the one who's looking

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,270
and introverted i'm looking at my own

00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,190
shoes yeah right and he actually what is

00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,510
looking on the other yeah guys shoes

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,880
when we're talking to each other right

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,880
yes oh yes and and with dancing it's the

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:03,070
same basically well it's like can I can

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,590
I have your please can we can we do this

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:09,070
ok we haven't ridiculous ok you're the

00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:12,610
wife yeah okay no yeah you look younger

00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:15,340
so J man i'm leading so and this is slow

00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,440
boards ok ok ok so you have to do this

00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:20,410
one back ok this one yeah and and then

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,139
this and then this what and enjoy it ok

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:28,330
right and one time out the other

00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:30,039
level 1 and 10 k 2 3 1 2 3 they are

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,949
really thinking about it right you

00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:36,159
really have to practice this more but I

00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:37,810
don't want to practice it with you so

00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:39,639
you see the difference when you start

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,169
doing this you're actually looking on

00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,490
your on your shoes and you have to think

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:45,159
about this and you have to think really

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,039
hard and you can talk to the other one

00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:49,779
so dancing is some kind of conversion or

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,879
yeah you have to you want to discuss

00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:53,680
things for example you want to have a

00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:55,599
nice chat something like that you want

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,000
to talk to others and you want to dance

00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:59,770
okay in a smooth way but in the

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,229
beginning you can do that because you

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,909
have to think about every step literally

00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,680
every step you have to think okay now I

00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,539
have to do this and then this and then

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,849
this and then I've no no the other one

00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:13,180
else are you sorry I saw your shoes out

00:05:09,849 --> 00:05:15,819
there dirty now sorry I'm okay goes over

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:19,659
and over and the idea is actually two to

00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:22,029
make this a subconscious act okay to to

00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:23,499
practice this all over again and soon

00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:25,330
you were getting better and better and

00:05:23,499 --> 00:05:27,849
you don't have to think about every move

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:30,339
what you want to want to do and you can

00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:36,610
well you can master the stuff that's the

00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:40,029
idea so and another exercise or another

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:42,819
another discipline where cutters comes

00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:46,539
to mind is martial art actually the

00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:49,990
origins of Qatar is in martial arts it's

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:54,250
a Japanese term and it means a figure no

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:57,460
form and actually a cutter is a well I

00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,460
let this I let this kind of explain he's

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:03,460
better in this so yeah would you

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,919
introduce panel where we actually get

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,960
another slide which shows a single

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:13,360
cutter I think it's the first cutter and

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:16,449
shotokan karate people learn but s-band

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:21,460
already said we're very happy to have

00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:25,210

you were talking in German but even if

00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:54,910
you don't understand German I think it

00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:57,040

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:02,290
programming by the pragmatic programmer

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,030
some some years ago they brought the

00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:07,000
idea from from the martial arts through

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,680
programming and get really popular I

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,710
think two or three years ago with a

00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,230
software craftsmanship movement they

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,650
they introduced cutters especially at

00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:24,610
code retreats totoro new programming

00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:28,990
skills then we'll just just talked about

00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:34,660
that the the cutter and karate actually

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:38,680
symbolizes some some moves it symbolizes

00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:41,440
a fight against an opponent and against

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,630
an imaginary opponent which isn't

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:48,640
actually there but but you practice the

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:53,020
moves such as he was there such as there

00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,950
was an opponent in programming we don't

00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:58,430
really fight against

00:12:54,950 --> 00:13:00,560
upon an empowerment I think yes

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,080
sometimes we think the customers or our

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,000
bosses the p.o also is our opponent by

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:14,480
usually we don't hit them so I hope you

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:18,800
don't I never did so what we really

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,620
struggle with an in programming are some

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,730
some tasks some some problems which we

00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:32,630
try to tackle and so the the starting

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:35,600
point for a coding cutter is some small

00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:40,840
focused asked some small focused problem

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:45,140
we are reducing often we choose some

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:48,350
some algorithm problems such as decoding

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:50,960
roman numbers or doing a caesar cipher

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:55,630
doing prime factorization something like

00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:59,900
this we show an example for this shortly

00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:02,120
and should be small because you want to

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,890
practice it over and over again so it

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,400
should be something you can solve and

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:13,190
about 15 minutes maybe 30 minutes that's

00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:14,990
some small focused tasks and when when

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,210
solving the problem you will find a

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,970
solution but the solution isn't in the

00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:21,740
cutter what is really the main focus

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:23,720
what is the main what's the most

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,750
important part the most important part

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:34,000
is how you actually come to the solution

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:36,110
which which path you choose and maybe

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,270
when you're doing the cutter again and

00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,130
again you may take some some different

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,500
paths to explore some different paths

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,410
this is a variation to the karate kata

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:48,380
where it's a very fixed form but in

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:51,230
programming it's part of the exercise

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:55,960
that you that you actually learn and to

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,960
walk different paths to solve the task

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,250
and I already said that you're doing a

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,759
Carter again and again and then we'll

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,980
also talked about how often he did the

00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:12,009
same Carter and so a single run is only

00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,959
a small snapshot it's not enough to

00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:17,740
solve the problem once but you're doing

00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:20,529
it not not at one time but over the time

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,920
you're solving the same task again and

00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:27,100
again to own your skills in solving that

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,259
problem let well actually solving a

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:36,670
problem but to own your programming

00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:41,639
skills at large so band why do we

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:45,880
actually do cut us well here's the thing

00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:49,899
this is the in English it's a huff thing

00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,449
to say Pythagorean theorem you know that

00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:55,209
well a squared plus B squared C squared

00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:57,519
is very simple you learn that in what

00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:00,040
5th grade sixth grade seventh grade I

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,910
don't know somewhere there okay so very

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:07,319
simple actually there are over 300

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:11,730
proves for this simple sentence in

00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:16,569
several disciplines algebra trigonometry

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:19,089
number theory and so on okay over 300 so

00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:21,670
the result is always the same it's a

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,730
proof that a squared is b square is plus

00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:27,639
b squared is c squared that's it but the

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:31,209
way is always different in all the three

00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:35,649
hundred proofs so the idea was cutters

00:16:31,209 --> 00:16:37,600
is not to have well the best result the

00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:40,449
idea whether with a programming cutter

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,689
is more like exploring different ways

00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:46,029
and actually well you can make this on a

00:16:43,689 --> 00:16:48,250
broader level so for example you can use

00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:51,130
different languages something like that

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:54,130
and then you can settle for one solution

00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,459
and you can refine it in detail over and

00:16:54,130 --> 00:17:00,250
over again however the way will always

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:02,709
change you will make the same exercise

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,549
over and over again and never do it

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:10,630
twice the same almost never that's the

00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:13,180
idea so the idea why you should do this

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:16,690
is well you learn several ways you

00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:19,180
haven't seen before doing this in normal

00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:22,300
programming you're only most of the time

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,089
use one way the one you know you think

00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,920
is the best and if you succeed if I well

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,510
if we write test at all and they are

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,060
green then you're happy and you're done

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,640
the idea was a cutter is well actually

00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,800
to have a tool for self-reflection where

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,760
can I improve where can I master this

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:43,930
thing then who did it for 35 years and

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,840
he is a master truly is sure but have

00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,360
you ever seen a programming master well

00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:52,690
there are actually not so much you

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,240
actually well you can be announced as a

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,910
master if you have a good solution one

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:00,520
solution for word problem but that's not

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,680
the the idea here the thing is can you

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:08,250
use your tools like a master would

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:12,370
that's the idea with the cutter okay

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:15,000
usually you use cutters in in isolation

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,920
and with constraints let me explain

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,110
isolation means that you don't use

00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,740
cutters or you are not working in

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:26,320
cutters on for example agency code which

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,330
is code which is already there okay

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,100
there are some refactoring cutters but

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,930
they are special usually you have an

00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,630
algorithm and you just code this

00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:36,220
algorithm and you have a very very clear

00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,320
environment you don't have any

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,660
dependencies you want to focus on the

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,300
problem on the on the way to solve this

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,460
algorithm that means the isolation part

00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:50,290
and the constraints are well you can

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:52,300
have different skill booster let's call

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:54,880
them that you can use for example

00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,470
different languages so the cutter is

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,630
totally different when you do it in Java

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:01,450
and JavaScript or as you will see in

00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:05,140
CoffeeScript it's it's it's it's

00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:07,570
different of course it is yeah but the

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,540
the solution is always the same you will

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,820
solve the algorithm okay so another

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:16,060
constraint could be well what could it

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,610
be have an idea don't use the mouse yes

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,990
only the keyboard that's a good one have

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,460
you ever done that if you actually if

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:25,820
you want to own your keyboard skills

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:29,570
use a lot of shortcuts and you actually

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:32,930
get get faster doing this yeah so and

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:35,630
it's amazing how how are only few people

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:37,850
only a few program I no can do

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:39,860
everything with keyboard and don't use

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,980
the mouse anymore they actually improve

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:45,350
their coding skills with avoiding the

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,810
mouse you can do it as a game wipe a

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,820
programming every time you do do you

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,890
touch the mouse you get a bump from your

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:54,500
partner something like that okay that's

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,320
an idea okay so that's one constraint

00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,960
you can and another would be like don't

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,630
write methods that are longer than two

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,060
lines yeah so so you really lolla in

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:08,030
java two lines in java then you have to

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:10,430
have really focused small methods yeah

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:16,880
that do only one thing and don't have

00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:19,340
those like 80 or 180 line methods so and

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,170
for example you can well if you if you

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,000
want to practice a pattern a coding

00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:24,680
pattern a design pattern or something

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,570
like that you could say well I want to

00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,120
do this algorithm with this pattern if

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,240
it makes sense or not doesn't matter

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,280
okay just try to get to the point of

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,410
this pattern yeah that could be another

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,930
constraint and so on there that doesn't

00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:43,720
of constraints if you are not challenged

00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:47,210
enough with the cutter already okay so

00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:49,610
the question is still why you should do

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:51,470
this well there's one thing which is

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,870
called mustn't memorization it's it's

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:56,030
not really a scientific thing it's more

00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:59,180
like a well we it's it's a model how

00:20:56,030 --> 00:21:01,850
this could be well interpreted what we

00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,550
are doing the thing is that you were

00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:07,580
that your muscles have kind of a memory

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:10,220
and the the longer you practice

00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:12,500
something the more this memory will be

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,180
trained so that you actually can do

00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,280
something unconsciously and don't have

00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,750
to think about this okay that's what I

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,120
what I told you with the Gita for

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,940
example and the idea of muscle

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,740
memorization means we're in programming

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,510
you have a muscle memorization for

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:29,960
shortcuts you use for example

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:33,710
refactoring without shortcuts is pain in

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:35,330
the earth really well it depends depends

00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,850
on the language just used to

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:40,250
living in Java land oh yes sorry so yeah

00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,130
that's dead not actually and a language

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,780
is today even in a even in a functional

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,390
language and a Joan don't have a support

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:51,140
of an often integrated development

00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:55,160
environment and even then you use you

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,380
especially you use a lot of shortcuts in

00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:00,290
your in your simply text editor yeah i'm

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:02,390
just using a very plain editor nowadays

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,600
yeah and that's at the end you're using

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,280
the shortcut of course yeah so and this

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,050
is and this is and and you're not

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,940
thinking about this you actually you

00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:13,100
only think well I want to have this

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,190
segment of code I want to have it there

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:18,110
and that ought to make it you don't well

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:19,700
actually when we pair program I remember

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,500
times when I actually went when you

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,930
asked me which which shortcut do you use

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:26,840
and I have to think about it well okay i

00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:28,700
put my note just a moment I yeah let me

00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,440
try this yeah that that's it that's it

00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,480
and then I can show you know this watch

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,310
my own I'm watching my own thing else

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,520
what I'm doing because I don't know the

00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:39,080
combination I just do it so in the thing

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,390
the same thing you want to do on a

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,490
higher level you can you can make the

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:46,640
the challenge even harder you want to

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,770
you don't want to think about well how

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,320
can I make homemade can I make this

00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:54,200
class disappear how can I refactor it

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,090
into three classes for example you don't

00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,220
want to think about this you want don't

00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,990
want to think about every step you know

00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,270
the book by martin fowler he explains

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,580
every single step you have to do when

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:07,450
you don't use automatic refactorings and

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:10,640
you don't want to think about everything

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:13,160
everything a step you have to do to make

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,500
refactoring heaven the idea is actually

00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,050
massive memorization you don't you just

00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,060
say well I want to have here a well

00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:22,880
three classes instead of one and Tara

00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,860
it's done in seconds that's the idea I

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,870
think we talked enough now yes coding

00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:33,890
let's get or something more practical I

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:36,080
mean you still have to talk but you're

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:40,580
talking where you Cody I'm talking a

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,010
little bit what we are showing you now

00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:47,200
is

00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:49,360
where is it I'm showing you a cutter I I

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,050
practiced for them from some time now

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:57,220
and the task the problem is to decode

00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:59,710
roman numbers probably all know roman

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:05,680
numbers at least a little bit that where

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:09,750
the D is for 500 the eye is one and you

00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:12,870
sum up all the letters i'm using

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:15,790
coffeescript as a language i'm using

00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:19,860
jess mine no what's it code I think Jess

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:23,320
my Jasmine okay Jasmine as my testing

00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:27,880
framework and i'm using a little tool

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:30,010
from Korres dojo calm which does run my

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,700
tests all the time so i don't have to

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:38,680
switch back and forth i just save my

00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:42,250
code and the editor and it saves it runs

00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,630
the tests it shows me well Jasmine shows

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,720
me whether everything is green and

00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:49,390
Goddess Durga actually records or all my

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:54,100
steps so I can look later what what I

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:56,830
did at what moment especially focus for

00:24:54,100 --> 00:25:01,680
me on in this cutter is that I want to

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:05,470
do a very strict test driven approach

00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:08,140
you also probably all heard about

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,780
test-driven or I hope most of you

00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,480
practice it where you first write a

00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:15,580
write a test that shows you something

00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,240
something is broken something is missing

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:21,970
you have a red test you implement to

00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:26,860
make the test green and then you reflect

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:29,140
on the code and see well how can this

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:32,650
code be refined how can we reflect on

00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:37,990
the coach to make it more more clean to

00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:41,140
make more express full and we thought it

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:44,020
would be too boring if you just have to

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:50,170
look at me coding here for for some

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:54,640
minutes and so I i will i will actually

00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:57,340
be your your code monkey here but to

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,930
to show you to talk about what we what

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:03,280
we actually or what I'm actually doing

00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:06,340
it's like I open up my skull and have

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:09,760
three voices inside of me and those

00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:14,080
other I'm I'm doing a little bit of

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:17,200
talking myself for my own and the

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,300
bastion is the one who always wants that

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,270
that everything's okay he says make it

00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:27,370
run make it green band is the the clean

00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:30,610
coat guy and he's not the naked guy he's

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,980
well I'm actually the programmer I'm the

00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:38,620
one who I'm the one who does the actual

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:42,010
work and the other guys keep telling me

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:50,730
I just break everything but well it's

00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:55,080
necessary sometimes so ok let's start

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:57,880
which state are we in does a test run

00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,600
you're bugging me already I think it's

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:05,280
quite mean ok hey I'm starting off with

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:09,040
a clean slate here no no files yet I'm

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:11,590
setting up my my true its coldest oral

00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,220
thing and on the left hand side here I'm

00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:17,830
then running my tests we agree in fine

00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:28,510
yep the green good ok when no test with

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:30,610
no coat yet so so what you're actually

00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:34,780
doing is you're you making the first

00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:38,770
test right yes yeah and I'm saying I

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,300
expect Rome and I to be one oh my god oh

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,930
my god now we are red I think we should

00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,970
do something but it's clean it's ok

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:51,160
limitation at fakest totally clean it's

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:53,170
not on let it it's ok oh no no no no a

00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,980
very simple website and put it a knot

00:27:53,170 --> 00:28:01,230
it's only yeah I want to just write a

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:04,420
second test for a magic number and easy

00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:07,500
expect what this looks also a little bit

00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:10,290
actually like I repeat all the time here

00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,020
suits IFI physics really think you

00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:16,530
should first yes I right we first fake

00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:19,290
it and then I would make it clean fake

00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:21,720
it did he say fake it fake it till you

00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:24,600
make it what no as long as it screen

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:28,170
it's okay I'm feeling good we can

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:31,080
deliver this late so much bigger here

00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:34,830
it's okay oh come on everything's

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:37,560
running but i really want to add the X

00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,990
here next and well this would get really

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,690
ugly so I'm refactoring this year ah

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:47,190
that sounds good what are you doing what

00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:50,640
is my doing down here okay do whatever

00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,650
you want as long as it's green so it's

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:56,280
green but it's a glee that's not the

00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:58,260
point either using an object okay and

00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,270
you're actually using that objective and

00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:04,310
how does it make it it's more

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:10,410
complicated with a good job very good

00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:12,690
and now it yeah I'm okay a new structure

00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:15,480
here there's actually this asian sure I

00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,570
see it I can oh that's clever oh that's

00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:21,150
cool good so that's really the go down

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,300
he looks okay but actually the test I

00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:28,830
don't want to write every test like this

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:30,480
so it computes single digits this is

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:35,570
what i really want to write something

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,920
like compute single for these romance

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,500
something like this is what i really

00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:42,270
want to have a structure hello no it'll

00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,080
grow of course this doesn't rise you

00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:47,670
don't know how to fix it undo please

00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,980
this doesn't run because we don't have

00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:52,470
this far these Romans yet I have to

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,510
write a little CoffeeScript method

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:56,100
father day so I think it's okay for

00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,680
refactorings when you have a red test

00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:01,050
you know that something's not right I

00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,940
know we were doing keep doing so we're

00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:05,070
factoring and the test is with a red bar

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,950
and refactoring on the product of coders

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:09,840
with a green bar only in short steps yes

00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:11,930
in it is all red you can't deliver the

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,700
software now okay everything's okay now

00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:17,250
I want to see whether the test really

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,800
bites yeah when I break it that's right

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,700
hit red so okay

00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,640
this actually is instead of this one and

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:30,420
now i'm doing the 14 I just a great good

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,640
yeah it's okay and now we don't need

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:36,150
this one anymore okay that's clear let's

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,810
color that's so okay now can I can

00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:43,740
easily add the X well this looks nice

00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:48,150
and ya know its borrowing I just add the

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:50,790
other one and then sitting rush isn't

00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:54,240
that exciting for just without adding

00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:56,010
its rest great what maybe to be nobody's

00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,150
yeah but he's making a clean and it's

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:05,280
nice the structure is great and make

00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:06,930
it's isn't it okay I think we can should

00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:13,560
get to something more interesting now

00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:17,910
like computes additive digits so we can

00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:23,280
handle more than one like doing it I

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:26,100
don't know the eye which is the is-6

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:28,140
right yeah sure my god oh my so the V is

00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:33,060
a five and the cigs yeah and the eye is

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:34,950
yeah that's okay oh come on you showed

00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:37,260
such a good structure and now you're

00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:40,380
breaking it all again so why not it's

00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:43,980
not broken if Ronnie six okay I mean

00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:46,520
yeah this is actually I know but I can

00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:50,840
actually bring this on a step-by-step

00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:54,330
this the five is actually at the v + k

00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,190
this one is actually the eye and the V

00:31:54,330 --> 00:32:00,210
is there because it's the first

00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:01,800
character of the VI oh no that's app to

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,560
whatever you want there as long as it's

00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:07,440
green oh I agree again not call it in

00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,480
Germany and shoot at them okay and the

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,130
VI is actually which is the Roman string

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,220
so that's impressive I'm actually

00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:20,820
actually solving this like a riddle not

00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:26,640
or to push like why aren't you

00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:28,710
continuing its its length okay okay so

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,809
you need you needed a new test phone for

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:35,720
a motivation to change ok yeah it's ok

00:32:32,809 --> 00:32:37,909
and now to push it a little further i'm

00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:40,070
using now something we can handle two

00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:44,509
digits i want to be able to handle three

00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:47,809
digits knock no Roman string way wow

00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:51,580
this really is used to read you know

00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:54,679
what you're doing there yeah I mean I

00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:57,350
keep doing this forever no it's I mean

00:32:54,679 --> 00:32:59,450
it's not leading to something is it I I

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:03,230
want to see where this leads me and then

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:05,749
okay this when you can take the 17 after

00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:09,710
that and make a 10 plus 5 plus 1 plus 1

00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:12,230
and and so on it's not that's well that

00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:15,230
would be a stupid idea wouldn't it and I

00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:17,059
don't do stupid things do I ok so as

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,039
long I did I get this right as long as

00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:21,379
you don't see the structure you keep

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:23,330
going until you see it well i see i have

00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:27,259
here some last structure to here and

00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:29,779
actually down here i can say this also

00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:32,419
see that now this is a similar structure

00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:40,970
this actually loops so i want to turn

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:44,480
this into a loop step by step how I I'm

00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:48,230
I mean you're running yeah but yeah I'm

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:52,460
I'm unfolding manually loop step by step

00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:54,470
I know but I'm getting the little step

00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:58,730
by little step and so I'm staying on

00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:04,789
swinging off oh yeah another structure

00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:07,190
why not switch case and folks are it

00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:10,909
make another class in a hierarchy of

00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:13,010
classes and bad yeah every ant ironic

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:17,030
why aren't your ironic are you angry now

00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:19,550
yeah yeah I'm I'm frustrated I'm okay so

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,159
now i can take the the second line in

00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,950
here in the mall and take that line in

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,290
the lou opened oh no there's no way okay

00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:30,260
okay I'm sorry and for three years

00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:33,800
actually well I tested it up that's the

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,960
Roman string length okay oh that's cool

00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:41,260
this looks ok now it's good that's and

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,260
now I can actually weaken the oh no

00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:51,299
yeah okay I can weaken this one to

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:54,149
include the two and so I don't need this

00:34:51,299 --> 00:34:57,089
one down here anymore and I can take

00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:00,030
this line in here and I don't actually

00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:02,460
condition anymore whoa whoa whoa okay

00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,130
okay can you repeat that piece is it was

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,740
much too fast for me i will show you

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,460
another time okay um did you get that

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,720
it's it's amazing isn't it okay and I'm

00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,630
it was all the time green that's

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,000
impressive part now I'm iterating over

00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:20,490
over actually all the characters I can

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,130
do this also a little bit easier just by

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:27,210
by splitting my string on every

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:31,500
character and I don't have to look the

00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:35,760
characters up manually no it is splitter

00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,349
Nolan split and I'm making this a little

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,039
bit more coffeescript you are putting

00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:44,430
the sum up here in front of the four NOT

00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:46,170
lifeless without me okay well in my

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:49,289
opinion that's more coffee sports

00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:52,680
tournament if you think so okay I think

00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:57,450
we should just clean okay yeah we should

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:59,609
get it a little bond on here and what's

00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:04,410
interesting now are the subtractive

00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:08,279
digits mm-hmm oh that's it that's freaky

00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:11,190
right I mean so XL is actually an l is

00:36:08,279 --> 00:36:14,010
fifty and exes yeah then and because the

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:17,849
X is before the other party so we are we

00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:20,130
actually here 20 20 off with our we get

00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:22,559
a better 60 instead of the 40s so you

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:26,640
some everything so yeah of course it

00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:30,150
must be 60 yeah obvious magic numbers

00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:33,809
yeah why am I not surprised so just take

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:35,730
Wendy away and everything's fine but I'm

00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:37,829
go now then cool NT isn't there by

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:40,020
accident because we accidentally added

00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:42,779
the 10 instead of subtracting it and so

00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,299
this is just two times the 10 that we

00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:51,029
are subtracting here again and 210 well

00:36:45,299 --> 00:36:55,289
that's the ex and the X is of course the

00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:56,040
first character of the XL of course it

00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:59,790
is

00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,220
okay and well this doesn't work for the

00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,110
XL but it doesn't work if we are just

00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,790
having the XL somewhere in the string

00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:12,480
because we are testing for equality back

00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:14,670
here and well I miss using regular

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,380
expressions a little bit by saying if we

00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:20,510
have this as a substring everything's

00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:23,190
okay so you're actually grabbing the

00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:26,280
subtraction out of the the spring yep

00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:28,890
okay and then use pull the first

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:31,530
character sorry your good question the

00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:33,390
first car just trying to get this you're

00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:35,640
pulling the first character can watch it

00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:37,950
later then okay no I'm just right that's

00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,640
okay the right speed for you I mean it's

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:45,500
not really keen is it it's I mean it's

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,750
it's green what matters i'm using now a

00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:56,460
different subtraction to see well this

00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:58,410
time we're two off and now i'm trying to

00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,440
reflect the step by step to have a

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:06,210
similar structure i can take a little

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:11,850
larger steps now again because i already

00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:14,340
know ok where this leads me so it's it

00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,350
ok again you're really a same structure

00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:19,770
to see a pattern in it and i get this

00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:30,240
yeah and i'm expecting the XL now out of

00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:33,210
it to have really the same line cases

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,450
that's a why so it's like don't repeat

00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:41,610
your eyes yeah okay and i'm doing the

00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:44,130
same down here so it's interesting how

00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:48,380
you have to know the code to actually

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:51,030
make it to make it more load again so

00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:54,210
okay now we really have the same line

00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:57,960
here just using a different variables on

00:38:54,210 --> 00:39:01,620
one time XL one time ivy and the screams

00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:06,350
for another loop so we can just go over

00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:08,110
an array and put those things in their

00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:11,620
starting first with

00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:18,670
with just one with ivy and then I'm

00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:20,830
saying okay for every ass in in my

00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:24,460
subtraction I'm feeling uncomfortable

00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:27,670
again it's why do you because of all the

00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:30,820
structure yeah but good see now I can

00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:34,270
just replace this one ok I can replace

00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:36,820
this one oh now I switching to another

00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:41,680
workspace and now I don't need this

00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:44,770
anymore and ok now I can just extend the

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,250
array up here and it breaks everything

00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:50,080
and when I'm removing this fronts so

00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:51,850
actually what you're doing now with the

00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,220
list is the same you did with the object

00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:57,670
before the digits and subtractions are

00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:00,180
better structures too well to well have

00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:04,510
ever more maintainable code right yeah

00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:07,630
so and ok I'm pushing the if up here

00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:09,580
making when for essence subtraction when

00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:12,370
Roman string matches s then i'm

00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:14,980
subtracting this ok i think the code

00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:19,050
looks pretty nice already we're missing

00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:22,390
some of the subtractions here and i

00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:27,220
actually forgot my cheat sheet but i

00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:29,890
think i will get them together now ok

00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:33,430
it's 444 and the other subtractions

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:38,890
there aren't roman numbers are this is

00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:40,330
999 so actually you you think you are

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,150
more secure and you take bigger steps

00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:45,580
right yes that's the idea ok because I

00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:50,110
just have to add here some Sun little

00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:52,660
things and I can handle this within a

00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:56,110
few seconds that's what it'll call 10

00:40:52,660 --> 00:41:00,010
seconds that sounds like it looks like

00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:02,710
very clean ok so I think this is my

00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:05,650
finished algorithm these are my test

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,900
actually this test seem to have some

00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,910
duplication like we had for he and for a

00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:12,280
year so I'm just removing this one oh

00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,600
and you see the line goes a little bit

00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,530
different i want to have clean

00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,609
regression test two so I'm saying

00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:22,989
computes

00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:29,650
mixes of it the turf and subtractive

00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:32,170
digits I like how you how you keep and

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:36,099
your your test code clean as the

00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:40,089
prosecco down here I see okay everything

00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:42,849
went okay with a new test good so the

00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:49,349
test look ok for me now the code looks

00:41:42,849 --> 00:41:52,299
ok I think we can finish this quit and

00:41:49,349 --> 00:42:11,410
everything's gone great thank you very

00:41:52,299 --> 00:42:19,660
much ok ok how much time have we left in

00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:21,759
70 minutes yeah that's ok as you might

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,430
imagine I didn't do this the first time

00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:27,249
this way I actually practiced I first

00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:30,430
started this the scatter with JavaScript

00:42:27,249 --> 00:42:33,999
i did with javascript about 50 times or

00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:36,960
so was slow at the beginning but and

00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:39,700
then i get fast I I took different

00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,809
different paths I tried two different

00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:46,900
solutions and well lately i switched a

00:42:43,809 --> 00:42:49,329
coffee script and address mind-tour to

00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:52,390
learn that better and to learn how how i

00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:57,640
could can do TDD with that and to try

00:42:52,390 --> 00:43:00,900
some ddd things with it what should you

00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,140
pay attention to when practicing a

00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,140
coding cutter

00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:15,380
first thing takes take some time you

00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:18,320
don't have to have a lot of time for for

00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:21,830
doing cutters as I said you should be

00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,030
able to solve it and 15 to 30 minutes so

00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:28,850
you don't have to take a day off for it

00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:31,730
but you should do it you should repeat

00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,740
doing the card and so it's it's good to

00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:36,880
reserve some some time where you can

00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:41,030
again and again practice your cutter

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:44,360
maybe think about going to the office

00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:46,760
every other day 15 minutes earlier and

00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:50,210
starting the day off with practicing a

00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:55,240
cutter or maybe meet with some

00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:58,190
colleagues every Monday after lunch and

00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:00,980
everybody does a cutter then take take a

00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:05,360
little time for for practicing cutters

00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:09,920
and then repeat and repeat and repeat it

00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:12,800
over again this does really feel strange

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,090
when you do it the first time oh no when

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,830
you do it a second time actually because

00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:18,440
the first time it's just that you if

00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:20,660
you're solving a solution and it's okay

00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,620
that's what you used to and then you

00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,300
throw the code away and the other day

00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:28,940
you're looking at the same solution at

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,460
the same problem again and thinking hey

00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,220
I've got the solution in my head it's

00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:39,080
it's stupid to just solve it again but

00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:42,950
do it anyway and you will see the second

00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:45,890
time you reflect on what you're doing

00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:47,720
and and you will do with things

00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:50,840
differently and you will do things

00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:53,450
differently that the next time again so

00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,000
you will you will you will improve you

00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:59,390
will own the way you solving this

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,140
problem and you will you will especially

00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:06,160
get better and not just in this problem

00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:11,170
but in certain aspects of programming

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:14,600
like when when i did this cutter i tried

00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:17,810
several several different approaches

00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:20,120
which which tests I which test cases i

00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:23,000
use and i learned a lot of

00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:25,820
about how different a different order

00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,550
and different test cases that I use lead

00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:31,040
me to different solutions leave me

00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:37,760
easier to solutions or which are harder

00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:43,430
to find a good solution seek feedback on

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:47,090
the path you take see seek feedback from

00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:50,480
from others like let others watch you

00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:53,000
maybe record your cutter I told your

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,720
coding dojo is a tool to record the

00:45:53,000 --> 00:46:01,550
steps but just take snapshots also did a

00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:03,260
lot of screencasts i recorded just what

00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:07,160
i did on the screen and show this to

00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:09,920
others i also get a feedback when when

00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:13,190
publicly showing much on my showing my

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,950
cutter what i could do different and I

00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:20,390
was reflecting on on it myself after i

00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:24,410
did a cutter I thought while what what

00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:27,110
did good what what happened during this

00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:30,530
run what did go well what didn't go well

00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:33,010
what do i do wanted different the next

00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:35,960
time they were down what I wanted to do

00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:43,070
different the next time so so I actually

00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:46,190
remember into it and actually do

00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:51,620
something different the next time try

00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:55,910
some Ultron alternatives and my what

00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:58,790
what I experienced is as I told you I

00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,700
did this cation Yahveh script about 50

00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:05,060
times and in the beginning I was trying

00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,980
very different ways to see where where

00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:12,410
does this one lead me where this room

00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:14,210
this one lead me and I was I was trying

00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:17,990
very different things but with the time

00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:21,470
I was more finding the one way that I

00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:25,040
was that I wanted to choose to solve

00:47:21,470 --> 00:47:29,750
this problem and so the variations got

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:32,000
small and small and small and until

00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,300
lately actually has reached the language

00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,520
and

00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:38,120
this of course what is a big distraction

00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:48,830
and threw me a little bit off track and

00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:51,170
let me try very new way again this is

00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:53,210
make it work make it right make it fast

00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:55,850
I think you all know this from every day

00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:58,910
programming that make it fast is only

00:47:55,850 --> 00:48:02,060
the last the last aspect this is also

00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:03,860
holds true for Coty's to first thing is

00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,780
you want to really have a solution and

00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:08,090
then you want to have a really clean

00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,580
solution anything well this is a really

00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:12,770
good way to solve this problem and then

00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,110
at the end it's also nice to become

00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:17,810
faster and faster with the time but this

00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:22,750
isn't the main focus of a kata this is

00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:22,750
just a byproduct you reach

00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:40,349
code retreats is something with who a

00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:45,240
few has been to a code retreat okay two

00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:48,559
very long as Laurie or 450 code retreats

00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:53,099
or something something different that

00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:55,140
really really expanded during the last

00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:58,559
two or three years from from the

00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:02,009
software craftsmanship movement the idea

00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:07,140
is if you're just practicing your

00:49:02,009 --> 00:49:09,150
programming alone well well it happens

00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,849
that that you're yet that you get off

00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,920
track that you really have have to do

00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:17,309
your everyday programming and code

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,519
retreats other idea that you're that

00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:22,680
you're owning the craft together and

00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,349
you're taking a full day off together

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:27,869
with other professionals and then many

00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:31,309
code retreats there they're really great

00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:34,319
programmers and doing a full day of

00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:36,869
intensive and practice and code retreats

00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:39,990
you're usually doing the same problem

00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:41,460
that is a game of life they are some

00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,650
other code retreats like a test

00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:47,970
automation or legacy code retreat but

00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:50,700
most of them are around a game of life

00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:52,890
where you're practicing with with

00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:56,099
different paths so you can you can

00:49:52,890 --> 00:50:00,029
practice with different people to solve

00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:03,089
this problem it's it has a little cutter

00:50:00,029 --> 00:50:08,730
feel to it but it's also a little bit

00:50:03,089 --> 00:50:16,200
different all the slides with all the

00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:23,099
links are on up there link is good ken

00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:27,809
cutter oh the battery is of and they

00:50:23,099 --> 00:50:30,930
were also on is good can cutter this way

00:50:27,809 --> 00:50:33,930
you can find the slides and this is also

00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:37,920
a list of a few more links where you

00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:39,790
will find instructions ideas on how to

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,590
do Kolkata

00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:48,860
especially behind most of those links

00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:52,220
are small problems that that it that you

00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:54,380
can use as a starting point for your of

00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,440
things that you can use as a starting

00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:00,010
point for your gutters assemble the

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,750
eight is a Saturday it's Saturday yes oh

00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:13,960
okay so everything's fine so I looked

00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:17,570
wrong oops I'm ah ok good so again

00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:23,120
you'll find the slides on is good Ken

00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:28,190
cutter and the spectro to offer slide

00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:31,190
and I hope you know got an idea what

00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:35,240
this what this mean of this talk means

00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:38,240
cut us let you internalize basis basic

00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:45,040
steps so we'll use them subconsciously

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:49,850
why programming so just like in karate

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,890
ricotta isn't a real fight you also cost

00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:54,560
you have to do your everyday work and

00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:59,180
you also learn something during your

00:51:54,560 --> 00:52:03,190
everyday work but to really hone your

00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:06,890
skills it is very precious to have a

00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:11,240
reserved space where you you just

00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:13,360
practice those those things that that

00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,670
happen that just rush by during the

00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:21,190
viewing your everyday work this is

00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:26,360
ricotta's coming this is where I got us

00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:28,580
help you weather as we say let you

00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:30,890
internalize those those basic steps

00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,630
that's just happen to flow that you

00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:37,550
don't think any more because you just

00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:39,950
feel them you just do them and then you

00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:42,770
will use them during your everyday work

00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:45,370
so you're just getting a better flow in

00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:45,370
your programming

00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:54,890
I would like to invite you today not

00:52:52,250 --> 00:53:00,560
only to listen to the stuff but actually

00:52:54,890 --> 00:53:06,680
to start doing a Carter today here we

00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:09,560
got as in course this is called can you

00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:15,980
cut or not can we cut er questions to

00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:18,619
you about you and as an example I got I

00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:21,250
got three problems here that you may may

00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:25,070
start with these are three typical

00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:26,960
typical problems that you may may handle

00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:29,900
that you may may tackle when doing it

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,589
cutter and just will present them

00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:35,300
shortly on the upper left is prime

00:53:32,589 --> 00:53:38,510
factorization split an integer into its

00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:42,020
prime factors okay so far has to be

00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:47,359
split into 2 2 42's has to really split

00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:50,720
in 2 3 & 7 what is what most people do

00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:53,390
with with golden Carter's is that they

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,580
will combine it with TDD because it

00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:59,089
really helps you to get into this flow

00:53:55,580 --> 00:54:02,540
when you're doing TDD to solve those

00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:05,030
problems another another example is the

00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:08,119
test manager on the upper right mutate

00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:10,790
every word so the first last character

00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:13,490
stays the same and the inner characters

00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:16,580
are in reverse order you may have that

00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:18,830
we are actually capable of reading text

00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:22,460
when the inner you know letters are

00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:24,740
managed when they are maybe in random

00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:28,790
order just the first the last characters

00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:30,530
is the is correct and this is doing do

00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:32,570
the text manager with Java that's a

00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:40,099
constraint and don't use any external

00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:41,750
libraries oh boy yeah this is pain

00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:48,800
driven development either yeah

00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:50,839
definitely and the last idea is the

00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:54,349
string calculator where you take a

00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:56,510
string have have several digits oh I

00:54:54,349 --> 00:54:59,510
have several numbers in it and you add

00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:00,239
them up they may be delimited by comma

00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:06,479
and you lie

00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:10,919
in or you can specify a a separator so

00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:13,409
these are three ideas and I would like

00:55:10,919 --> 00:55:17,459
to invite you to choose one of those

00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:22,109
ideas and do it today try to solve one

00:55:17,459 --> 00:55:25,499
of those ideas you will also when you go

00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:27,419
on is good Ken cutter they are they have

00:55:25,499 --> 00:55:31,229
the slides they will have the problem on

00:55:27,419 --> 00:55:34,109
the last slide and don't just do it for

00:55:31,229 --> 00:55:36,209
you for yourself maybe do it with

00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:38,339
someone else you can reflect with him

00:55:36,209 --> 00:55:42,239
together or you show it to someone else

00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:45,689
how you solve this problem I also invite

00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:48,209
you to come to our booth that's yeah we

00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:54,769
are from from IT agile our booth is

00:55:48,209 --> 00:55:57,989
behind the godhra branded coat check and

00:55:54,769 --> 00:56:01,259
sadly I I won't be there because I have

00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:03,539
to look after my sick son but Sebastian

00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:07,319
will be there and two other colleagues

00:56:03,539 --> 00:56:10,859
will be there show them how you how you

00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:13,529
solved which path you chose and in seek

00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:16,259
feedback from them and also if you want

00:56:13,529 --> 00:56:20,909
to have other other hints other ideas

00:56:16,259 --> 00:56:24,449
about Carlos please talk to us give us

00:56:20,909 --> 00:56:30,059
feedback that's really important so we

00:56:24,449 --> 00:56:34,919
mean it with feedback okay so band any

00:56:30,059 --> 00:56:37,169
famous last words thank you thank you

00:56:34,919 --> 00:56:39,439
for listening I had fun last words and

00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:42,389
it's a big thing huge oh yes then oh

00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:44,779
come on oh come on page that's how you

00:56:42,389 --> 00:56:44,779
see you

00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:54,680
Larry to clarify that five days ago he
