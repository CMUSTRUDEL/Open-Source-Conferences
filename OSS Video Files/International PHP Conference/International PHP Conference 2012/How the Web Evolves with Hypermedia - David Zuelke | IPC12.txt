Title: How the Web Evolves with Hypermedia - David Zuelke | IPC12
Publication date: 2013-05-10
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2012
Description: 
	The success of the Web as a system for information exchange that effortlessly scaled to span an entire planet can be attributed to a very small set of key factors. But the interactions have thus far been driven by the smartest, most adaptable hypermedia consumers there are: human brains. Now it is time for machines to communicate in the same evolvable, unbreakable and interoperable fashion.

so this talk is called how the weapon

00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,010
volts with hypermedia and I've already

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:21,150
been introduced my name is David it's

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:23,220
okay and you can alternatively spell my

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,769
last name like this that of course means

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,570
I'm German I'm from the beautiful city

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,099
of munich oktoberfest is just over so

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,650
everyone's a little bit sad because the

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,070
beer ran out I work there as a founder

00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:37,559
of a company called bit extendo we do

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,719
various web development consulting

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,370
things and I'm also the lead developer

00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:44,399
of the agave framework this is my

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,350
Twitter nickname arm it would like to

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,600
poke fun of me on Twitter whilst I'm

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:53,129
speaking I'd be delighted I can't see it

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:55,829
anyway so um we want to talk about how

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,420
the web and how it evolves and whatever

00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,710
this hypermedia thing is who has heard

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:04,909
of the term hypermedia who's heard of

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,380
the term hypertext a lot more right ah

00:01:04,909 --> 00:01:09,090
so it's basically the same thing we can

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,970
maybe addresses of the inner moments

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,150
where I'm quoting Roy fielding who's

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,250
fell of Roy fielding okay so that's the

00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,630
guy who's invented rest who has heard of

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,159
rest keep your hands up if you've heard

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,320
of hypermedia as the engine of

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:31,490
application states okay interesting so

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,509
the web first okay that's the first part

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,040
because the web really is the largest

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,290
application of the internet I mean

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,270
there's email before there's been gopher

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,189
and there's DNS that cause a lot of

00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,189
traffic but ultimately the world wide

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:49,290
web is the first data exchange system

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,490
that spans the whole planet our planets

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,149
called Earth it looks like this in case

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,829
I didn't know a photo the guys at on

00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:00,180
Apollo 17 took I think it's very nice

00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:05,369
although they had a slightly nice of you

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,770
arm and every like there's a million a

00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,090
billion dots on this planet and they're

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:10,789
all connected and they can exchange

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:15,040
information

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:17,180
and if I sent half of this room an email

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,250
half of this room can read this email

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,140
the other half of this room is going to

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,189
be can you forward me the email and then

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,150
the rest of the half of the room is

00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:24,890
going to be yeah what's the email

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,689
address like and then that's total chaos

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:28,340
right so you can't retrieve emails

00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:31,180
anymore we send billions of them every

00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,500
day but the web Meg's data accessible

00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:37,400
but the question is why does that work

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,200
so well and the fundamental reason why

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,579
the web has grown to be this massive

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,920
system that really provides information

00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:48,019
from every country on every subject you

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,900
can imagine where everyone can add

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:53,329
information and it somehow doesn't bog

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:56,150
down the infrastructure is due to the

00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:57,680
hyperlink because the hyperlink means i

00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,450
can click something i can follow a link

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,970
and it takes me somewhere that means the

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,700
web there's no tight coupling right it's

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,659
loosely coupled by design it has the

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:11,659
concept that I can link to google com

00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:14,569
and google com doesn't have to link back

00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:16,639
to me that was actually a concept that

00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:18,829
in the very very first drafts of HTML

00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,989
was on the consideration and I could

00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:24,049
have done this some of you might know

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,940
the rel attribute on links there is a

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,909
ref attribute which is the reverse

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,359
relation right so maybe on the very

00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:33,979
first days of the web arm when Tim

00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,199
berners-lee and the others invented the

00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:38,239
world wide web at the CERN in Geneva

00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,760
Switzerland they thought you know maybe

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,069
every link should link back because then

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,329
our documents always you know consistent

00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:46,909
in the Ling's and we never have dead

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,709
links but that wouldn't work because

00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,329
you'd need an infant notification

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,919
infrastructure right so first of all

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,389
there is a totally ridiculous thing we

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,859
are linked to google and i have to call

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:57,079
google and say hey kiddo link back to me

00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:59,359
because my link won't work other wife so

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:03,319
that doesn't work right and then the

00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:05,209
other thing is i delete my link again to

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:06,970
google com and then Google some house

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,500
needs to say oh yeah hold on let me

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,509
delete my reverse link and if they don't

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,579
maybe I can't tank my link done but it's

00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:16,669
not like that the web has a 404 not

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:19,010
found and other stuff is gone and that

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:21,250
is in its design it's not an

00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,440
afterthought the web fundamentally

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:26,600
embraces failure as one of its core in

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,970
supports right and if you want to add

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,620
more information to the web then that

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,950
doesn't think that doesn't increase the

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,650
friction well it increases the friction

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,600
in that you need to be able to find the

00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,660
stuff but that's what search engines are

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,350
for right but it's not like at some

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:46,810
point you reach some sort of network

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:49,820
limit other than bandwidth which is

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,400
another topic but as a from an

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:57,020
information architecture you can grow it

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,150
to any size you want so it has no limits

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,210
to scalability and that is because it's

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,180
protocol centric there is no application

00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:06,890
semantics and as it uses HTTP and what's

00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,850
called the uniform interface of HTTP

00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,100
that we're going to look at later

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,050
briefly this is not supposed to be a

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:15,080
technical talk the technical aspects of

00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,610
this will be covered in the talk right

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,860
after this keynote I think in the same

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:25,220
room so that is the web but this web

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:31,669
that I talked about is mostly the human

00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:33,050
web right I click something and I do

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:36,680
something on the web and when the web

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:39,350
changes that's not a big deal when I

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,350
started using the world wide web there

00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:46,090
must have been a 96 or 97 who who

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:49,220
remembers what Yahoo looked like in 1997

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:52,280
it was a hand maintained catalog of

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,720
stuff right and you'd have four really

00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:58,100
wonky pages all of them hosted and

00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:00,070
Geocities or something so that was 1997

00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:05,900
and Yahoo looked like this right and

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:09,919
then in 2011 it looks like this it's

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:12,320
pretty different but as humans we try

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,440
you know but most people go to yahoo to

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,090
find something I mean honestly nobody

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,890
gives a about horoscopes I hope

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,660
anyway right or what is OMG i don't know

00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:25,040
maybe maybe some people have it as a

00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,690
star page because their browser

00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,940
installed just did it and they don't

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,120
know how to get rid of it but what same

00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:35,960
person okay anyway the point is that

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,130
humans going to doc adapt right in 1997

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,230
when I went to yahoo and I wanted to

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:43,420
find something

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:47,550
a search box and you know the years go

00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:52,360
past and the search box is still there

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:54,790
right so over these 14 plus years that

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,540
i've used yahoo and is older than 1997

00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,980
I've been able to search it for the last

00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,900
14 plus years I've also found it

00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:08,290
incredibly ugly but that's a different

00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:13,350
story and the point is that or the the

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:17,640
cool concept is that our human brains

00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:22,030
are kind of like a state machine on the

00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:25,890
web and we drive the interactions my

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:29,500
brain is a pretty bad state machine

00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,170
because basically it loses memory all

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,240
the time right so I go to the fridge and

00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:37,870
then i'm at the fridge and I'm like what

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,900
the hell am I doing here and it that has

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,090
its upsides to because I can use that

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,540
knowledge that my that I have a goldfish

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,710
like memory to to surprise myself so

00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,120
sometimes I eat chocolate and then I

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:50,890
decide I don't want to eat the other

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,180
half of the chocolate so I put the

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:53,230
chocolate somewhere out of my sight

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,470
because otherwise i would eat it and

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:59,140
then it's like behind me like you know

00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,490
on a shelf and two days later I walked

00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,240
back into the same room and I see the

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,800
chocolate it's like Christmas for me but

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,230
I hope not everyone has such a bad

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:13,150
memory so so you guys are probably

00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:15,190
better state machines than i am but um

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,100
but even i managed to focus for a few

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:22,410
minutes at a time usually and i often

00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:25,420
get bored right and when i'm bored uh I

00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:27,700
pretty quickly think you know I want to

00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,560
do something awesome or maybe buy

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:35,310
something awesome and then I think what

00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:39,040
awesome things don't have and have this

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:43,930
pacman stress ball it's pretty cool

00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:46,570
right yeah I see but that gets boring

00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:49,210
after a while and then I'm back in this

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,200
boring loop and then I think okay maybe

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,630
I can buy something awesome

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,160
and so I go to Amazon right who doesn't

00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,290
go to Amazon like the only things I ever

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:00,430
buy from amazon if it's not an Amazon I

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:03,620
don't buy it it doesn't exist no really

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,050
no honestly like because I have to sign

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,500
up and they don't show me the shipping

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,240
costs and also I don't even buy from

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,120
amazon if it's not sold by Amazon's I

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:18,860
just won't buy it I don't have a TV

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:21,050
because the 1i want is not an amazon so

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:26,450
so I go to Amazon right and I enter

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:28,790
awesome stuff and the first page is not

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:31,670
really awesome is I think it's

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,940
lame so I click the I click the next

00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:38,450
page right and that's still dull and

00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:41,420
start know there's pattern duct tape

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,490
maybe but it's also stupid like really

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,590
stupid lazer star is kind of cool I like

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,470
lasers right but it's not with a shark

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:51,700
so it's just a laser I don't want sharks

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,700
with laser beams attached to their heads

00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:02,410
so and I click through and then I find

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,790
this progressive international gmm c68

00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:09,350
microwavable s'mores maker who knows

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:14,660
what s'mores are no is this column

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:16,100
there's a point of this okay so s'mores

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,710
work like this like you're in America

00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,810
you're at a campfire and you toast our

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,070
marshmallow and then you have chocolate

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,570
and you put the chocolate on a cracker

00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,430
and the marshmallow on it and I crack on

00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:27,380
top and the hot marshmallow melts the

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,050
chocolate and it's like a very yummy

00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:31,990
heavy calorie snack and then you eat a

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:36,110
hundred of them and then you get well

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:37,820
diabetes but so and this thing catches

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:41,390
my mind catches like you know my

00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:43,190
attention because I mean it's pretty it

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,230
looks pretty cool why it's funny it's

00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:46,280
apparently you put water in and then put

00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,410
it in the microwave and then it does

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,820
something fancy so it makes something to

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:56,060
eat and that is amazing also I think

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,280
progressive international GM MC 68

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,640
that was that's like that's like

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:03,710
Cyberdyne systems you know not honestly

00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:06,410
these people probably make fighter jets

00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:08,990
and robots and submarines so that's damn

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:12,230
cool and I think GMC 68 could also be a

00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:15,710
terminator model name so I'm like also

00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:18,860
also I happen to have owned the gm's CU

00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:23,830
66 and 67 which the one was a shark with

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:26,810
the rocket engine and the other one was

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,540
wife right no no that's not cool this is

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:40,280
better a shark with laser beams attached

00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:42,260
isn't so so this s'mores maker it's not

00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:45,080
a shark but it's still awesome right so

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:46,750
I want that so I'm gonna buy it so I put

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,310
it in my shopping cart and then they

00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,780
they're like pay with your currency so

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,340
they are gently telling me with a very

00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,690
nicely designed add that they're going

00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,280
to screw me over with their currency

00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,190
conversion but I don't care at this

00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,690
point because it's just six dollars so i

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,460
click Next and then i can log in because

00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,230
i already have who doesn't have a now as

00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,310
an account right so i click next and

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:10,820
then i can place my order so far so good

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,050
I mean it's a bit pricey so maybe i'll

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,720
quit cancel at this point but that's

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:20,300
totally up to me right so there is a

00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:23,900
point of this if we model this process

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:28,070
as code because i'm really i suck at

00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:30,620
these diagram things I and I'm not an

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:34,850
artist either so if I if you ask me to

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:36,770
draw a circle the ends won't meet so i

00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:39,500
have to write code right and the code

00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:42,410
looks something like this so so while

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:45,500
David is bored and not broke I first

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,720
squeezes the pacman stress ball because

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,400
that you know takes a stressor but I

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,560
probably still birth so there's like

00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,810
actually a hard-coded but this is my

00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,970
state machine and this is somewhere in

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:59,840
here so I make in your browser to

00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:03,680
amazon.com and while I'm not happy I go

00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:07,520
through this state and if I'm if I go to

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,649
this page first and on the homepage so

00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,730
it fires up a search to awesome stuff

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:16,699
right and then it breaks the while loop

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:20,149
ends and I'm still not happy and the

00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:22,730
next item is a search results page does

00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:26,389
that page have something awesome it

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:30,369
didn't for me so it but it has more

00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:32,990
pages so I'll go to the next page and

00:13:30,369 --> 00:13:34,879
that happened four times if you paid

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,740
attention earlier and then all of a

00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,800
sudden there was some awesome product

00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,850
also check this so if there's nothing

00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:49,249
awesome I'll go to sleep for an hour and

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:50,740
try again because I have the fundamental

00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:53,809
belief that whenever there's a problem

00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:57,079
that you can't be arsed to solve maybe

00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:59,420
it's gone away after you've woken up so

00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:03,679
I'm going to retry but anyway so now

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:06,470
I've found the product right so I follow

00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,269
the awesome product how does that work I

00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,559
click a link right I click the link to

00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:13,939
the product which is the s'mores maker

00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:16,040
and I'm our product page I kind of added

00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:19,970
maybe do i really like it condition here

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,490
but the I ran out of space so I add the

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:26,240
click the Add to Cart button right and

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:28,339
that gets me that gets me here so that's

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,050
fine i click to the checkout and then it

00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:32,360
takes me to the login or register and

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:34,639
then I can follow to the login or I can

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,050
follow to the registration but since my

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,170
brain knows that I have an amazon

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:43,220
account I answer my details and I click

00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:46,220
proceed so I follow log in that takes me

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:49,040
to the order summary and I follow the

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,379
click to the confirmation and with a

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,379
fifty percent chance i'll be happy so

00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:57,589
and then the thing is over I think I

00:14:54,379 --> 00:15:01,160
hope and otherwise i will be going to

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:04,970
buy something else that was really easy

00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:10,429
right but why is it so easy to model s

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:13,549
code because these conditions the follow

00:15:10,429 --> 00:15:14,839
the next page is it awesome is it

00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:17,029
awesome as a difficult condition that's

00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:19,220
like up to taste and maybe some weird

00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:22,520
conditions or artificial intelligence or

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:25,550
maybe the position of the Sun on the sky

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:30,590
so it was easy because it was driven by

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:33,020
my brain right and we all with our

00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,170
intelligence our human intelligence we

00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:39,200
drive the interactions on the web

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:41,690
intelligence is not it's always relative

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,700
right so there can also be little

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,910
intelligence on the web and then the

00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:48,650
idiots drive the interaction and that's

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,700
happens sometimes for instance there was

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:54,560
this really fun story last year arm

00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,360
where people you know people who google

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,950
website addresses like they type

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,020
amazon.com in Google and then click the

00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,790
first hit so people apparently type

00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:04,610
facebook login click the first link lick

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:07,640
the first link right so and there's this

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:11,840
readwriteweb com facebook wants to be

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,100
your one true login so of course i click

00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,560
that if i want to log into Facebook

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,180
right and then i end up at this page and

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,860
that kind of looks like a newspaper but

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,450
maybe i don't understand that so i

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,000
scroll all the way down and click a few

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,880
random buttons until I sign in with

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,850
Facebook page appears this really

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,320
happened and then I click sign in with

00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,910
Facebook and it takes me back to the

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,530
comments and I get really stupidly

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:38,270
frustrated and I post angry rants like I

00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:42,410
want the old facebook back this is

00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:44,120
wack this really happened like a guy

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,130
like writing an article like this like

00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,570
he I was just learning Facebook and now

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,390
they change everything and why is it red

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:54,170
not blue well maybe because you're not

00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:56,240
on Facebook right so that can

00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:58,630
also happen so don't make things too

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,700
complicated in this case it was clearly

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,860
non computer savvy people and also

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,120
people who can't tell a newspaper from a

00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:11,860
fire hydrant well hey so they added all

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,860
they added this note eventually

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,220
right but that didn't fix the problem it

00:17:24,809 --> 00:17:27,750
was like an influx and then I think

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,000
Google just at some point said okay this

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,730
is really terrible and they just you

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,309
know not down but it was the first

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:39,809
a second hit for a while so be careful

00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,770
what you wish for with the intelligent

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:46,950
interactions so that's the human web

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:48,840
right p things driven by humans and

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:55,710
humans are insanely good at adapting to

00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:57,990
changes so face if if Amazon decided hmm

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:00,470
if Amazon decided to give me the order

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:06,630
summary and the shipping cost estimate

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:09,240
before I log in fine I mean unless I'm

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,090
I'm OCD but I'm not that OCD maybe

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,070
people some people are so city they say

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:16,409
999 this is not Sam as on I used to so I

00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:17,820
won't buy anything but most people are

00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:19,289
probably going to be like oh ok so it

00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,429
shows me the order details first now and

00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:23,789
then they're going to be you know it's

00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:25,730
like navigating ebay I family believe

00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:29,059
that the less you know about computers

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:32,370
the better you are at navigating ebay

00:18:29,059 --> 00:18:35,700
because so I Bay you know you have you

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,880
have the you have the merchant or the

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,799
buyer and there's the username and in

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,690
brackets there's a number that's totally

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,919
meaningless and then there's a star and

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:50,970
it's so I'm I I think there is they have

00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:54,029
a they have a server farm with keyboards

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,559
and monkeys on them so whenever you

00:18:54,029 --> 00:18:57,690
click one of the links like the username

00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,370
and it's sometimes it takes you to the

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,690
you know the reviews for that user and

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:03,390
sometimes to its profile and sometimes

00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,799
you send a private message but most

00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:06,630
people are just like yeah you know I'm

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,070
kind of used to it after seven years it

00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,730
doesn't piss me off anymore and I don't

00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:14,210
you know I don't have to go half of half

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,740
an hour of jogging to cool down after

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:19,020
outrageously losing a bit because it's

00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,190
stupid it's still on the german website

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:22,190
it still has this ah

00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:34,290
click here click here to watch this item

00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,260
in my ebay and the link is not on click

00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,760
here it's on my ebay but when you click

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,900
it it doesn't take it to my ebay it

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,130
watches the item in your ebay the US

00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,500
side fixed that I but i think the the

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,870
German side is still like this and it's

00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,920
madly confusing so you can do better but

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,780
let's assume that you have a nicely

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,450
design page and Amazon is one of them

00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:56,760
although Amazon does anyone here run a

00:19:54,450 --> 00:20:01,110
shop or something or some sort of

00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,940
reservation service nobody really I have

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,320
a question oh yes you so here's the

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,820
thing you know when you go to deutsche

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:11,400
bahn or Lufthansa or or a car rental

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,830
service or even amazon and you want to

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,710
buy something and the moment the moment

00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,810
they try to sell you stuff you can't go

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,920
back like the link the company link

00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,810
doesn't take it to the home page anymore

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,740
there's no way out they want to lock you

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:29,310
in is that intentional no it's just

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,860
badly designed okay okay but I god I

00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:35,130
need to continue so that was the human

00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,140
web and the Machine web so the question

00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:42,270
is can computers do this as well maybe

00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:44,100
because mmm it's a bit you know flaky in

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:48,300
terms of how do you express all this

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:50,400
like you can you teach a robot to buy

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,840
exciting thing like how does a robot

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,760
even know that the s'mores makers

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,590
awesome okay but that's a different

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,510
story so let's keep that out let's just

00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:00,420
say the interactions can we teach a

00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:02,310
computer to discover the workflow so

00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,520
server office so can I can I can I

00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:07,470
client say oh ok so I know this and so

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,810
follow that and I don't have to know in

00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:13,350
advance what the impossible interactions

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:15,120
are because you tell me Theo server can

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,560
we follow links like in the search

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,010
results can we follow links in the next

00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,780
page until we have the product we want

00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:25,740
just paginate through 20 results at a

00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:28,980
time can we I don't know maybe handle

00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,250
without breaking and that's the key it

00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,450
changes a change in how the resources

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,860
are laid out

00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:41,010
maybe amazon decides to not sell DVDs

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:43,230
anymore directly they you know outsource

00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:44,940
that to their love film subsidiary so if

00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:46,470
I click buy this and then I get taken to

00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,059
the LA film page high as a human can

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,679
deal with this because it's probably

00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:51,299
going to have a your sign in with your

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,190
Amazon account awesome it's just a

00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,840
little user interface change so click

00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:57,659
here to buy and it's the rest of the

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,690
experience is the same right but machine

00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:05,340
is going to be like me me me does not

00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:06,840
compute and usually or maybe a newly

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:09,720
added information maybe I have some sort

00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,940
of API and and i want to add stuff and

00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,169
i'm going to use soap stuff breaks right

00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,720
and then your clients call they're

00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:20,789
really angry and your weekends screwed

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:24,960
the answer is yeah we can do that and

00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:30,210
it's really easy because that's called

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:34,529
rest this stuff is what rest is about

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:37,440
rest is not about nicely formed URLs or

00:22:34,529 --> 00:22:39,750
HTTP status codes resses about

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,630
interactions our network architectures

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:47,399
about applications that can evolve over

00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:49,320
time the problem is that usually people

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:51,600
 up the rest api is right because

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,289
then they can be like hey i have a rest

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,870
api another boss is happy and the VCS

00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:59,929
give them money because VCS don't give

00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:03,570
you money if you don't have a rest api

00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:06,630
no seriously like they like you have a

00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:07,860
rest api and then if you answer do you

00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,809
know what rest is and they're gonna be

00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:14,580
like screw you and go broke so so that's

00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:18,529
become an insane hype and the reason is

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:20,669
that rest is kind of a fluffy term

00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:23,159
everyone can attach the sort of meaning

00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,490
to it it's become this password like

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:28,350
ajax you know a jake is exactly the same

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:30,240
thing everyone did it after two thousand

00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:32,010
one or so when I East are the first

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,559
supporting it but until someone called

00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:37,980
does marketing term nobody cared about

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:40,200
it and rest is was in this thesis from

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,789
Roy fielding and it described back then

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,190
how the web already worked at least for

00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:46,559
humans and how applications could

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,190
leverage the same advantages of these

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,970
interactions

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:53,580
close to be forward compatible to be

00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:56,580
ever-changing to be properly durable in

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:58,170
the event of changes but p but then the

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,210
marketing folks show up right and

00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,800
they're like wow that's an awesome term

00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,360
and it's four letters our customers

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:05,400
don't understand so let's use it for

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,410
marketing it's like the cloud hype makes

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,840
me angry because so no no I was

00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,060
in San Francisco two years ago and that

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,930
that's when I knew the cloud thing is

00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:23,900
that's hopeless the term is I'm in a bar

00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:28,250
and this this Scotsman shows up and he's

00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:31,280
drunk and high I think he's like

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:34,350
40-something and he says you'll know

00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,980
America's awesome and and goes on about

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:41,130
he how he worked for adobe and then he

00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,840
offered to me to buy cocaine and I said

00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,060
no thank you and he said well maybe

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:47,610
you'd I don't know him by other drugs

00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:49,590
and I was like nah no I'm fine and then

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:56,970
he's like well have you heard about the

00:24:49,590 --> 00:25:01,770
cloud and I'm like go on I want to hear

00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:04,590
this so he's like to the cloud if you

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,360
have windows on your computer and then

00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,190
the cloud is the internet and you want

00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,820
to download photoshop and then it

00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:14,700
downloads only the delta for photoshop

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,160
and i said the what the delta and I'm

00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,450
like so downloads a delta between

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,280
photoshop and windows with photoshop and

00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:23,220
he said yeah I have to just the Delta so

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,680
I say so download photoshop no no just

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,620
the Delta the cloud is awesome you can

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:33,570
have photoshop on every computer you own

00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:35,040
and I'm like okay have a good night and

00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:37,200
that conversation really happened and it

00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,420
was terrible because see and now

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,490
everyone has a cloud and that's also

00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,690
terrible because when the cloud first

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,020
started it was such a revolutionary

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,400
thing right it was amazon once again

00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,990
they said hey we have infrastructures

00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,670
and maybe you don't always have the same

00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:52,500
utilization so you just buy stuff on

00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:54,480
demand and if you need 17 load balancers

00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:57,570
then with a click of a button they're

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,500
there and then the marketing folks were

00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,860
like

00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,720
how do we sell this to end users and

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,850
corporate customers and then the tech

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,620
guys where well you kind of don't sell

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,080
it to end users it's just fantastic and

00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:12,050
at the lower our cost but I must sell

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:16,680
things otherwise I can't keep my Porsche

00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:17,990
and then they attach this cloud thing to

00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,830
everything right so

00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,350
infrastructure-as-a-service is fine

00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:26,100
that's that's the cloud amazon and I

00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:28,440
boot a few ec2 instances stuff like like

00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,750
engine yard stuff like Orchestra 0 for

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,210
PHP awesome guys rides like you click a

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:36,420
few things and it deploys a full stack

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,800
of a PHP runtime environment on an AC

00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,680
two for you and everything's managed

00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,820
that is the cloud I've heard that

00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:47,340
hotmail is the cloud email thing now and

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:50,820
seriously when I in 1997 hotmail was

00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,920
still around and it was slow but not the

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:59,870
cloud and today and you know

00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,870
everything's a cloud drive and it's yeah

00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:10,830
so so there's a hype about rest and the

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:15,150
problem is that this hype like in the

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:17,630
cloud leads to a delusion of the of the

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:22,320
actual value of the technology right

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:25,290
it's people overlook the the merits of

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,700
rest vastly overlook it because they

00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,500
need to ship they need to deliver they

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,910
need to convince the bosses nobody can

00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,190
quite put a finger on what the term

00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,290
means so everyone just labels it that

00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,180
way and by now people are like I don't

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,310
care if it's not restful I don't care

00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,200
it's just i'll call it rest and this is

00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:43,680
my api and as long as then i have an API

00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,840
everything's fine but that's really sad

00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,580
because things could be a lot lot better

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:52,920
and i'll try to explain it now and as i

00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:54,990
said if you want to have further inside

00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:59,300
more in the technical level at all right

00:27:54,990 --> 00:28:02,610
after this if i can keep my voice will

00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:05,760
will elaborate further but the idea is

00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:08,280
you know how we had the web and then we

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,440
had the human web and then the human

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:12,470
brain and then the Machine web a now

00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:16,320
it's time for the machine brain

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:19,350
we want hypermedia coming to the rescue

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:24,090
solving the rest dilemma because a

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:27,659
restful api needs hate OS which is a

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:30,029
terrible term it means hypermedia as the

00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:32,850
engine of application state and that's

00:28:30,029 --> 00:28:36,409
the the one ingredients that everyone is

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:40,470
always missing and that disappoints me

00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:43,159
sometimes it enrages me because i like

00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,720
raging about things as you've noticed

00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:48,600
but it also it also bothers other people

00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:52,710
like Roy fielding who invented this term

00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,320
rest right so he said that I'm getting

00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:57,929
frustrated I've never met him so I don't

00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,210
know if frustrated as this means I'm not

00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:02,450
gonna talk to you or I'm gonna cry I'm

00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:05,340
gonna chop your head off with an axe

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,259
could be any but he said if the engine

00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:10,559
of application state is not being driven

00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:14,429
by a hypertext then it cannot be restful

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:17,340
and Duff not a REST API and remember

00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,919
when I earlier said that hypertext and

00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:22,529
have a media kind of the same thing

00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:24,389
that's pretty much the case it's there

00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:26,460
are some fine semantical differences

00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,870
that are they used to be but nowadays

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,220
the term is pretty much used

00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,710
interchangeably I mean we know although

00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:35,070
hypertext from HTML right you have

00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:38,100
semantic markup for your for your

00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,990
documents and hypermedia is the same

00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,789
thing if the idea is if you have a

00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:47,279
well-understood media type that has

00:29:41,789 --> 00:29:49,230
defined semantics and as as such if you

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,169
use it you implement these

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:54,809
understandings for this media type

00:29:51,169 --> 00:30:01,679
because if you've who has used our PC or

00:29:54,809 --> 00:30:06,000
soap ah lots of you who has so you know

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,679
how how I not an RPC of soap the the

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,419
out-of-band knowledge drives interaction

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,100
right something doesn't work and you

00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:13,070
call the other guys and they say yeah

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:19,080
but you gotta call in it first and then

00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:21,600
execute right and the idea is that in

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,830
hypermedia driving the engine of

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,659
application state which is you know

00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,410
you've seen this earlier the david thing

00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:26,940
was

00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:30,360
a state machine basically a big while

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,650
loop following links the ideas do you

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,560
have this hypermedia type and you

00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,560
understand what each element means and

00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:41,700
from that understanding of course I mean

00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:44,100
you could build a model of whatever

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:47,250
resource you fetched from the origin

00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,210
server but it the server can also embed

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:54,870
links and you can follow these links

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:56,280
through so-called relations and then go

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:57,600
from one step to the other so you could

00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,880
follow the links on the search result

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,470
page you still need some logic to

00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,360
determine that you like the product and

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:09,270
that it's awesome and that a s'mores

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:11,130
maker is worth buying but it could just

00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:14,430
work like a human and you can build this

00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:17,850
I've built this and it's fun so a very

00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:19,530
good example of of an API that uses

00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:22,620
hypermedia as the engine of application

00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,980
stayed fairly well is the LA film API

00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,900
who has a last film subscription nobody

00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,380
it's not a porn service you can how you

00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:34,650
raise your hands really who's heard of

00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,880
it okay so that's Amazon's DVD rental

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:42,810
service right you go there and uh i

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,980
think it was british initially is from

00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:49,200
the UK i think and and they have an API

00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,670
this is the beta version have not looked

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,770
at it in a while so they might have done

00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:55,830
some changes but and i hope this for the

00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:58,710
for you guys in the back this is large

00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:02,360
enough see this is what a search returns

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,220
for Star Wars or something I think I

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,710
know old they looked for old yeah that's

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,270
it so it says total results nine items

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,620
for page one this is just for graphical

00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:14,670
user interfaces so you can ignore this

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:16,920
but note the next three links the first

00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:20,990
one is the link rel itself so it says

00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:27,290
hey this is where you're currently at

00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:30,780
and then it says there's a next item and

00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:33,840
then it says there's a last item and

00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,550
that's a third from the top see and if I

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,210
as a as a hypermedia client want to

00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,669
interpret and you can

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:44,820
this hyper media API I need to program

00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:47,460
my my client against this hypermedia

00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,789
time so the meaning of each element here

00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:53,909
is defined in a document you could put

00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:57,470
it in a schema you don't have to you

00:32:53,909 --> 00:33:01,679
need to document it in some way and then

00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:03,570
there's a search right so I know link

00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,700
rel itself always means the element it's

00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:10,590
in that's its URL right so arm in here

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,360
for instance in the catalog title could

00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,279
be a lingering self pointing to the

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,260
catalog title and I also know that a

00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:21,000
search can have various other links in

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:23,520
it for instance a link rel next and from

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,440
the semantics of this document type it's

00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:29,669
clear that the next means the next

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,770
search result page right so if I as a

00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:35,279
client want to scrape all the results

00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:37,830
for old from love film I code a while

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,230
loop and the while loop says while there

00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:44,490
is a next link follow that next link and

00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:47,490
consume the page boom done and they can

00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,620
change this link in any way they want

00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:53,070
the next link could point to Amazon or I

00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,240
don't care I just follow it right and in

00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:57,720
fact they can do this with a lot of

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,520
other cases here they have self next and

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,350
last or globally understood link

00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:09,179
relations the iaa the iono the internets

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:11,040
association for name assigned names and

00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,839
numbers I don't know now that's the I

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,230
can I don't know what whatever I ini

00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:18,000
means so um these are one understood

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,349
right and here are some link relations

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,389
that these guys made up there sit

00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:24,750
themselves and they have a link relation

00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:26,520
for the reviews of that title so they

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,580
say that's the reviews for star wars

00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,770
knights of the old republic these guys

00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:33,750
as I said got bought by amazon so

00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:36,260
tomorrow they could decide you know what

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:40,020
amazon really has a lot better

00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:43,109
collection of reviews than we do so

00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,970
we'll just talk to amazon and they set

00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:47,609
up a service that delivers the same

00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:51,480
media type that's done with a mime type

00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:52,859
and that returns the reviews in the same

00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,190
format that our clients have always

00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:55,050
gotten

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:58,079
from our ul and then they change the

00:34:55,050 --> 00:35:01,349
href here to amazon.com / something

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:05,400
something / reviews or sir and no client

00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:07,829
ever breaks and another cool part of

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,579
this is that all of this uses the

00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:13,710
uniform interface so I can I know that I

00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:16,410
can get the synopsis right this the

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:17,880
operation to read it I can try and

00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,220
delete it if I have the permissions is

00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:23,760
probably going to delete the synopsis

00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:26,210
right so with his uniform interface I

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:31,530
could say hey get me products 1 2 3 4

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:38,670
from Acme dot want hold on no that's not

00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:42,089
good that's evil calm because it's the

00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:45,960
evil stuff shop let me check the next

00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:52,890
slide as well ya see that would have

00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:59,550
been evil evil Dom hot fixing almost

00:35:52,890 --> 00:36:03,210
done yup looks good save click so we go

00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:06,300
to evil calm right and we get the

00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:09,540
products 1 2 3 4 and then returns a

00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:13,230
product in this case it's in the media

00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:14,579
type evil sharp that XML it's the shark

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:20,310
with frickin laser beams attached its

00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:22,980
head and it costs and it costs three

00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:25,050
euros 14 which freaks me out because

00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:26,190
that's too cheap for shark with laser

00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,990
beams doesn't mean everyone's going to

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:30,630
have one at that price right so that's

00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:32,609
not good but notice two things here the

00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:35,160
first thing is that I the ciphered chose

00:36:32,609 --> 00:36:37,980
this is not a must but I chose to inform

00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,400
the client that he can use various HTTP

00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,859
methods called verbs on this same

00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,040
resource so i can put to it to update it

00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:49,050
and i can delete it to delete it and

00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:52,829
also i told the server I understand the

00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:57,030
media type application / vendor combat

00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:59,520
evil da plus XML I did not say give me

00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,829
application XML or give me application

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,559
JSON because application JSON and

00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:10,309
application XML have no semantic meaning

00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:12,890
it's just a bunch of tags right there is

00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:16,240
no meaning to them so you must invent

00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:19,040
your own media type a hypermedia type

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,920
that can do state transitions and that

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,000
has defined semantics four elements and

00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:28,760
then you have a restful api and thanks

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,470
to the uniform interface right this is

00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,990
nothing not much to do with hypermedia i

00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:37,099
can now fix the price by posting no sir

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:39,049
by putting to the same URL the body that

00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:42,380
i got but with a fixed price and now the

00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:46,010
price is better and it says to a

00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,559
foreigner content right because that's

00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,569
fine I mean we don't have we could also

00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,460
return a 200 ok and say yeah thank you

00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:54,559
for updating the price of sharks with

00:37:52,460 --> 00:38:00,770
laser beams but it's not really

00:37:54,559 --> 00:38:03,280
necessary and the point of this also is

00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:05,960
not just following links and you know

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,369
not breaking when things change it's

00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,150
also about evolvability sorry

00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:15,109
creationists if you have an oor FEC

00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:18,500
style you bind your client to the object

00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:21,500
graph or procedures and this is so who

00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:23,839
has written so Klein's a break that

00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,400
broke who had to consume soap services

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,410
that broke because the stupid server

00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,470
vendor updated something who has had to

00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,670
you know pull an overnighter because

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:35,200
they you wanted to update something and

00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:37,760
it broke the clock the client stuff Wow

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,230
half of the room use soap and nobody

00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,460
ever bro so it breaks anything else good

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,290
stuff I don't believe you see because

00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:49,250
the problem with soap is kind of breaks

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:53,109
Klein's all the time it's you have this

00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:55,849
schema and you have this well defined um

00:38:53,109 --> 00:38:59,599
expression of what element can contain

00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:02,809
what values and usually you bind your

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,430
domain objects your problem domain to

00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:06,200
the interface so whenever you make an

00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,200
internal change it's a pain in the neck

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,359
to keep the clients in such a way that

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,730
they don't break it's usually impossible

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:16,579
and that's fine if you have one or two

00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:19,569
clients but if it's 500 companies around

00:39:16,579 --> 00:39:19,569
the world in different time zones

00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:22,930
the half of them is going to be like our

00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:24,310
program it doesn't work anymore nobody

00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:27,040
stands and stuff it just works please

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,900
don't break it and then you can stop

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,960
innovating now and you can find a new

00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:34,000
job don't be sad right it would be much

00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,800
better to expect the unexpected or ask

00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,430
clients to expect the unexpected so when

00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:44,020
I retrieve bacon bacon rates awesome so

00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:46,150
our chief bacon for 599 and one of the

00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,930
fundamental things of one of the

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:51,370
fundamental advantages that we've made

00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:53,560
compared to the past is that we can

00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:57,760
exchange data with self delimiting

00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:59,200
markup so you know we don't we don't

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,870
move comma-separated values around

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,240
anymore that you know you add a new

00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,980
column and everything is broken even if

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:07,840
you add a column to the end there's a

00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:09,850
chance that everything's broken because

00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,350
some people just insert into and with

00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:15,250
into the sequel database and then it

00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:16,630
says well no this column we have self

00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,610
delimiting markup so we can add things

00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,160
we can express a presentar for bacon for

00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:23,140
instance right we could do that or we

00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:26,950
can say we add a second price element

00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:28,390
and no client should break ready because

00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:32,620
I mean what is a client going to do with

00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:34,360
this document he's gonna he's gonna go

00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,560
to the product and he's going to look

00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:40,630
for the first price element he finds and

00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,790
if i add a second price element i can

00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:46,240
add further information for newer

00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,950
clients and old Cline's that haven't yet

00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:49,570
updated to this new understanding which

00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,950
is not essential to the understanding so

00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,560
i don't have to break stuff i don't have

00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:54,910
to break meaning they can just whenever

00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,500
they have time they can update and they

00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:00,940
can display prices in different

00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:03,970
currencies right or I could say hey I

00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:08,560
have two languages for the bacon now you

00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:10,690
can now also know a by shake and again i

00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:12,400
can introduce links right so i say the

00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:15,850
link to the category is such and such

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,250
and and then the href and it takes you

00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:20,250
to delicious stuff yummy stuff

00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:26,510
and the point is that this and the

00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:30,109
hypermedia engine of application state

00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:32,119
your clients become unbreakable order

00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:35,240
they should be ideally it's a lot of

00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:37,460
upfront effort so you need to put time

00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,799
into it and the crucial part is to do it

00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,089
from the beginning this is important if

00:41:39,799 --> 00:41:43,930
you know you're going to have multiple

00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:46,240
clients you should make this investment

00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:48,920
everyone's going to love it in fact

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:51,980
other companies could adopt your media

00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,480
type and could use it as well and my

00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,250
iphone app that's written against your

00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,569
service could work against other

00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:58,069
services as well because it doesn't make

00:41:56,569 --> 00:42:00,500
assumptions about what the URLs look

00:41:58,069 --> 00:42:02,780
like they the others could even have

00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,760
other category links and stuff as long

00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:06,559
as the fundamental concept and the links

00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,170
are the same we would have true

00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,510
interoperability on the web right so

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,549
that I understand that doesn't fit so

00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:15,650
well with scrum for instance and a lot

00:42:13,549 --> 00:42:17,839
of the a lot of you tight budgets people

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,700
have because like Twitter released a

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,380
REST API that's not restful they're

00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,910
stuck with it forever there's so many

00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,069
bad things in it that I'll point out in

00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:28,099
the next talk they're stuck with it they

00:42:25,069 --> 00:42:30,289
cannot it's unfixable they have features

00:42:28,099 --> 00:42:33,799
in the pipeline that they cannot do with

00:42:30,289 --> 00:42:38,299
their API it's impossible and that's sad

00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:41,059
if you can do it then you can make you

00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:45,670
can help the web evolve with hypermedia

00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,670
and there'll be fun thank you

00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,070
