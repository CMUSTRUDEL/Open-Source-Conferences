Description: 
	Frank Sons (Frank Sons - Agile Software & Code Qualität): Most developers feel productive when they are coding – the software needs to be finished and the deadline is approaching fast, isn’t it? And all these meetings are only wasting our time! But we also want to create clean code and a good, maintainable architecture. Have you ever noticed, that a couple of weeks into coding you already know what you would like to change already? Because now you have more information and really understand the problem? Understanding the requirements and taking some time for planning can really save you weeks or even months of coding, even in an agile world. I want to show you how you can train this and why you need to understand the requirements in order to create a good architecture.
