Title: Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning | Frank Sons | IPC Spring 2018

Description: 
	Frank Sons (Frank Sons - Agile Software & Code Qualität): Most developers feel productive when they are coding – the software needs to be finished and the deadline is approaching fast, isn’t it? And all these meetings are only wasting our time! But we also want to create clean code and a good, maintainable architecture. Have you ever noticed, that a couple of weeks into coding you already know what you would like to change already? Because now you have more information and really understand the problem? Understanding the requirements and taking some time for planning can really save you weeks or even months of coding, even in an agile world. I want to show you how you can train this and why you need to understand the requirements in order to create a good architecture.

good morning let so many of you find the

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,740
way down in the basement like a typical

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,910
developer environment right down in the

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:21,359
basement again but yeah thanks for being

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:24,869
here I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,000
my most favorite sentence um I tell

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:29,820
people of my customers weeks of coding

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,290
can save you hours of planning yeah and

00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,510
exactly meant that way very short

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,550
introduction my name's Frank I have a

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,440
Twitter account if you want to leave any

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,059
feedback and are too scared I don't want

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,590
to talk to me good bad whatever so I can

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:49,440
get better and now how you felt about it

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,920
I'll come just to me comic later to me

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,079
and tell me what you think if you find

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,079
it boring of your enjoyed it I like to

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,320
have feedback so I can get better also

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm a freelance consultant developer

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,790
coach where whatever you want to call it

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,830
and my main focus is like HR development

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,200
agile software development and code

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,060
quality that's why I have a nice URL

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,380
like code quality dr. D but that mostly

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,030
for me there's another thing I'm from

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,830
Hamburg that's why there's also this

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,689
Moines because in Hamburg we say Moines

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,920
and it doesn't mean good morning it just

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,560
means hello so you can say more in even

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,180
during the night it's always okay if you

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,880
saying more and more in you're talking

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,530
too much

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,799
I'm also running the PHP user group in

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:43,880
Hamburg since 2012 so if you're ever in

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,790
Hamburg feel free to come by and we also

00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:50,280
love to have you give me a like a talk

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,430
or a real talk whatever it's very

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,030
friendly very nice and it will be next

00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:00,509
week on Tuesday so if you're around feel

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,270
free to come by that's it

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,270
so to have a quick introduction I want

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:10,110
to tell you a small story about

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:11,459
application development let's start

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,290
let's say there was one summer time

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,770
there was an idea to create a new

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,200
application

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,540
a really fancy new idea everyone was

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,720
very excited about that we wanted to

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,900
have a cool name so let's say customize

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,990
application repository or very short for

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,710
car so when we started developing

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,090
everything was really fun it was fast

00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,880
we're really glad that we could work on

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:37,880
that and it was really going well and

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,050
the word was really nice everything was

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,120
shiny and it was solid so we were really

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:47,180
proud of what we were building and at

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,590
one point we showed it to our customers

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,760
because they said yeah that sounds great

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,510
while you're doing but we want to see it

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,270
and are you doing what we want to have

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,340
and they notice wait that missing a

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,870
feature we really need because I was

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,510
always climate change and it's getting

00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,490
warmer and warmer we need to have a

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:11,520
automated and climate air-conditioning

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,950
but wait we didn't think about that why

00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,580
why didn't you tell us before but yeah

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:23,010
it was obvious for the customer not for

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:26,880
us so we're a problem now architecture

00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:28,050
doesn't really yea cater the needs it

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,950
isn't really prepared to have this

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:35,250
feature what happened we don't know did

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:38,880
we miss it just to clarify this and what

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,230
we do now can we refactor rebuild the

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,000
whole application just to get this

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,830
feature and because yeah it does not fit

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,110
into the architecture do we have time

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,030
for that but probably not the customer

00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,010
really needs it fast and he was

00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,420
expecting it hmm okay so we're for time

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:59,130
we just put it somewhere where it's

00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:03,720
somehow fits it's working now so it's

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:07,650
okay right and well this happens

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,770
multiple times so after a while we have

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:14,030
something that does fulfill all the

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:16,169
features the customer wanted over time

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,989
but we are not satisfied with our

00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:20,820
application anymore we want to rebuild

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,500
it we want to refactor it and we want to

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,880
throw it away and just get rid of it and

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,370
start new because we don't know what

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,100
happened there

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:33,340
what does it sound familiar anybody of

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:41,199
your experience product like this yeah

00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:43,360
okay okay that's that so do you know

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,460
this like if you would have told me that

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,010
two months ago I would have done better

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,630
or was all information we have now if we

00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,880
start again we can build something

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,180
better yeah

00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,340
probably not but so how does it happen

00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:59,020
how does it happen if we if we didn't

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:03,370
get information the information had lost

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:05,199
somehow and why does stuff like this

00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:07,810
happen that's basically what I want to

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,639
talk about like how's this missing

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,900
informations how can we get this why is

00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:15,639
it happening and how does it influence

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,729
all software why does it happen all the

00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,520
time

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:24,010
Chinese whispers in German did a post

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,410
like the customer tote or project

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,820
manager what you all probably seen this

00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,740
picture was a trees like what the

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,599
customer told that he wants to do what

00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,970
the project lead understood that he

00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:35,950
wants to do what the software architect

00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,510
wanted to build what the developers was

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:39,610
building and so on and so on and what

00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,410
the customer really needed so I'd liked

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:42,910
playing Chinese whispers and if it would

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,710
be a smaller crore an unconference I

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,229
would probably just let it play now I

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:49,210
would give them someone a detailed

00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,889
explanation what I want to have and

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,180
let's see what the rests back in the

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,770
audience will understand out of that

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:58,090
would probably be very fun but basically

00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,280
most of the times I'm product we're

00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:02,020
playing like this how often as a

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,940
developer do you have real interaction

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,620
with the customer and he's telling you

00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,770
explaining you in a face-to-face

00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,389
conversation what he really needs you

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,820
get a ticket there's a user story maybe

00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:17,139
and it's in there and you have to figure

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:20,320
out what's really going on on Monday

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:23,139
there was the workshop for Nana Blanca

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,210
and he mentioned this and software is a

00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,030
means to automate a solution to a

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,979
problem

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,900
the rupture was event storming I will

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,150
get back later for that but the sentence

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,250
really struck me because it really fits

00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:39,550
into that there are certain paths if we

00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,700
take the sentence from the back we need

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,440
to have a problem I mean to understand

00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,060
problem what does he really need not

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,280
what he wants because as you know

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,410
sometimes I want something but let later

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,690
on they figure out that what was not

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,330
what they really needed so what is the

00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:58,320
real problem they want to solve then we

00:06:54,330 --> 00:07:02,390
can think about the solution the

00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:05,370
solution might or might not be software

00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:06,840
sometimes you might have ever think

00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,490
about a solution as you if you know what

00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,500
he is going to do you can tell him wait

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,210
that what you're telling me you want

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,460
it's not really solving your problem it

00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:18,060
might even be better if you don't do the

00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,160
software but if you think about a

00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,890
solution you find different ways to find

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,630
the right way to solve the problem and

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:26,730
we have a solution for that then we can

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,610
see how can we automate that what

00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:34,200
software can we build for that this is

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,820
the part where developers come in we

00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,230
also come in here because we need to

00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,880
have a solution for us a technical

00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:40,440
solution but also an idea how to

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
ourselves a problem but this is

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,180
basically what we have used to do

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:50,370
writing software but it's the last step

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:52,730
in a line of things so why is it so hard

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,230
that sounds quite easy right it's just

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:57,150
having the problem getting a solution

00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,800
and then writing the code it sounds a

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,250
little bit like waterfall but okay no

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,050
we're not going that route as a

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,520
developer we very often focus on the

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:07,650
wrong details we are thinking about

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:11,340
implementation details what information

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,920
what technical details do I need to make

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,130
the software run because there's ticket

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,770
and there is already a user story that

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,380
tells me what I need to do I probably

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,400
don't know why and what's going to

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:28,710
happen with that but I just need to know

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,690
these information to get it done so we

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,200
focusing on implementation details

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:36,060
smallest instead of understanding why is

00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,280
this needed what is going to be expected

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,800
from that and what is going to what does

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,110
the customer want to achieve with that

00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:45,540
we don't very often we don't really

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:47,700
understand the problem not only because

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,410
we want to or because we don't really

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,390
know that we don't want to that we need

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,310
to but maybe the customer didn't really

00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:58,779
give us information as well

00:08:54,310 --> 00:09:00,459
also yeah we don't have time all these

00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:04,779
meetings and now we need more

00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:06,550
discussions and yeah there are a lot of

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,110
companies with a bad meeting culture

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,610
where every meeting feels like a waste

00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,839
of time who has a real few as many

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:16,720
meetings that felt like a waste of time

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,579
so now I'm going to tell you you need to

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,230
discuss more I wouldn't call it meeting

00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:22,329
but you need to do more discussions with

00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,610
the customer with your colleagues versus

00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:28,870
they call with your project manager or a

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:31,889
product owner but we want to be

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,939
productive right we want to be coding

00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:37,889
most developers feel really productive

00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:39,999
for their coding and that's dangerous

00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:41,079
because if we don't know what we are

00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:45,009
doing and we don't know what we want to

00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:46,449
achieve it's kind of a problem I've been

00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:49,209
as a customer we were doing a

00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:50,949
refactoring and after two days my

00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:53,889
developer came up to me can we finally

00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:55,410
start coding and have things there sorry

00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:58,750
I don't understand the problem yet I

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,459
don't know what you want to do but he

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:02,649
was used to we have we don't have time

00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:05,559
with a deadline we need to do this and

00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:06,790
we need to get this done so we don't

00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,040
have time we need to start somehow

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,449
somewhere and there sorry I don't know

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,670
where to start because I don't answer

00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:16,059
the problem I can write something down

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,500
but I don't know probably after two

00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:19,300
weeks or two months someone will tell me

00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:26,610
that was wrong because yeah no I got the

00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:29,110
information so whoever's working a job

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:35,399
who feels not working a job maybe more

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:35,399
interesting why not okay

00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:44,029
okay interesting you didn't like it okay

00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:48,739
but agile you have you knows the HR

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:51,949
manifesto Oh only cover the agent

00:10:48,739 --> 00:10:54,199
manifesto as was written in 2001 by Kent

00:10:51,949 --> 00:10:57,439
Beck was signed by Kent bag Martin

00:10:54,199 --> 00:10:58,999
Fowler as a copper a lot of really

00:10:57,439 --> 00:11:00,979
famous people and they just stood

00:10:58,999 --> 00:11:02,959
together I mean each other's all along

00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:04,429
that extreme programming was in 90s and

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,809
all the ideas are back dating back to

00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:07,970
60s 70s

00:11:05,809 --> 00:11:10,699
they're really old and they sit together

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,279
and said okay we have some key values we

00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:16,100
see in developing a jar and these are

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,079
the four key values very important part

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,439
a lot of people now at least a jar

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,389
manifesto and then now these four key

00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:26,089
values but they concentrate only on the

00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:28,299
things on the left because they say

00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,199
these are important like for example

00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:32,869
working software over comprehensive

00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:35,689
documentation so we're doing HR we don't

00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:37,669
need to document anymore wait no that's

00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:40,039
not was standing there and basically the

00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:42,019
sentence below that that says we value

00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:43,339
the things on the left or while there's

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:45,709
value and the things on the right we

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:48,409
values the things on left more that

00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:50,749
means the left is more important to get

00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:52,549
things done but it doesn't mean that

00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:55,129
stuff on the right it's not necessary

00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:57,619
anymore but a lot of times people only

00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:58,999
read this once and they only remember

00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:00,350
the things on the left side and said

00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,789
okay we don't need to do all this thing

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,220
anymore we don't need to do any planning

00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:05,929
we don't need any following a plan

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:07,879
anymore let's like sounds like whatever

00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:11,509
we don't do that anymore we're doing a

00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:14,779
jar we just code no wait that's not what

00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:16,399
standing there okay there are a couple

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,799
of people who know the edge a manifesto

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,139
there's more to that who of you knows

00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,999
the 12 principles behind that because

00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,449
there's a second page on that website

00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:28,669
I picked only two of these twelve

00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:30,229
principles but these are like if you

00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:32,720
want to do that these are ways how you

00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:35,539
can achieve that and these two are

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,269
really important because they handle

00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,769
this problem business people and

00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:42,649
developers must work together daily

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:48,260
throughout the project okay whoever you

00:12:42,649 --> 00:12:50,610
have that in his project a couple but

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,170
the rest there was nearly everyone was

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,610
doing age' but only a couple of you are

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:58,110
doing that there might be a problem

00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,910
because this is really more or less the

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,980
idea of HR solving this problem that you

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,199
have missing information if you don't

00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,070
work together daily yeah you will have

00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:09,029
missing information also the most

00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:11,579
efficient and effective method of

00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:12,690
conveying information to and within a

00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:17,550
development team is face-to-face

00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:20,570
conversation hmm okay so we maybe we may

00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:24,209
have daily con discussions and daily

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:27,720
interaction with our business people but

00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:30,600
sometimes via mail via phone using slag

00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,389
whatever so there's information missing

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,829
again because you just asked something

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,449
you don't really they don't see what

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:39,690
you're doing so that can react to what

00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:40,980
they what you don't tell them and they

00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:42,209
don't show you what they are really

00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,850
doing so you don't see what you are

00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:46,829
missing what they don't tell you so

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:49,920
these two things are really for me key

00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:51,690
principles if you want to work agile and

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,370
want to solve this problem was we are

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,420
lacking information and we are we don't

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:58,529
understand the requirements but

00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,880
obviously there are a lot of reasons

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:04,380
behind that if you work in an Internet

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,300
agency or the customer really wants to

00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,800
get rid they don't want to care about

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,579
all this development stuff they want to

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,779
give it to someone maybe an internal

00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:14,399
department or maybe even an external

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,459
customer and say please do this for us

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,040
and I want to focus on my stuff really

00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:24,959
so there are valid reason why this

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,000
doesn't happen all the time and we

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,290
cannot really change all of these so

00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,730
what do we do what can we do there are a

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,089
couple of things that we can do to like

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,470
at least improve the situation perfect

00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:39,930
word we should say we need to do this

00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:41,130
otherwise that's not working but yeah if

00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,209
you have an external customer you tell

00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,329
them we are please we need to have you

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:51,660
daily in our office probably he will say

00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:55,980
no so who of you has heard of invest who

00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:59,910
feels using user stories as a definition

00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,290
of ready coupler invest that's a very

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,639
important or a very interest

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,810
thinking an easy thing to remember if

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,759
you want to have good user stories

00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:07,529
because there are a couple of points you

00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,110
can focus on to make sure that you use

00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:12,899
the story has all information at least

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:14,610
in theory that's necessary there should

00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,759
be independent to other user stories

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:21,120
because otherwise it's not one user

00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,759
story negotiable negotiable well that

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,440
means if you have feedback that you

00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,970
should be open to discussion if that

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,529
needs to be changed it's not a contract

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:30,889
that the customer told you you need to

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:33,089
do it that way

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:35,790
valuable is for me the most important

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,470
part coming back to I need to understand

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,930
what the customer tries to achieve if I

00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:44,670
know what the value in the user story is

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:46,620
I can prioritize prioritize the story I

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,329
know how important is for the customer

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:53,579
and I can try to understand what he's

00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:54,630
trying to achieve estimate able yeah at

00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,040
least a certain degree I need to

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,990
understand how big is the story what's

00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:59,850
going to happen and how much effort will

00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,980
this take not in hours but like in

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:04,949
t-shirt size or story points whatever

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,750
you're using it should be small enough

00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:09,149
to shoot in and it should fit in your

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,160
interation I would probably say it

00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:13,470
should be even smaller than that but if

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,290
it doesn't fit into an iteration you

00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,139
probably have an epic another user story

00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,779
or feature and it should be testable

00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,370
that doesn't mean unit testing but they

00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,670
need to be acceptance criteria you can

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,170
later on see okay now this is finished

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,120
also this comes back to valuable if and

00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:32,490
now what is going to the customer tries

00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,500
to achieve as a user story I can better

00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,870
have acceptance criteria to see if this

00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,660
is fulfilled so for me the most

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,910
important part in this whole list which

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,100
in itself is very useful is the valuable

00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:47,670
thing because I really want to know why

00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:50,610
is he doing that who a few has hey I had

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:53,220
to do tickets where you say okay I don't

00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,139
see this is any relevant to the company

00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,610
to the customer at all but yeah there

00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,139
are some politics behind that they told

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,259
me to do that but yeah I'm just doing

00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:04,439
that it's really we really think I even

00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:06,360
had a project at my former company where

00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:08,400
me and the project lead both agreed that

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,689
is totally stupid to do that because we

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,610
have a working software which is not

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:13,409
quite nice but it's working but there

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:14,520
was some internal politics that someone

00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:15,059
pushed it and he wanted to have a

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,819
rewrite

00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:19,649
new shiny application for that there was

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:24,149
no business value in my opinion there is

00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:26,339
no really important thing but yeah so if

00:17:24,149 --> 00:17:29,129
you if there would be a rule that there

00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:30,929
need to be discussed what the business

00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:35,029
value of something is this would have

00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:35,029
probably not be implemented

00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:41,730
another thing come back to event

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:44,009
storming who of you at least heard about

00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:46,679
TDD already finds that interesting to do

00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:48,960
something with DDD I think it's more

00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,049
getting it's more than a buffer

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,940
meanwhile event storming who has not

00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:56,399
heard of event storming maybe I should

00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,110
ask that first okay event storming there

00:17:56,399 --> 00:18:00,960
was the structure from Ana and beginning

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:04,769
in the beginning of the week it's a way

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,090
to get the domain keep pressure list

00:18:04,769 --> 00:18:07,590
like your business people and the

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,499
developers on the room and trying to

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,820
figure out what is your business process

00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:13,529
if you want to get creating new software

00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,110
something okay what will be the process

00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:18,419
really not as a developer but really

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:20,990
with this business people domain expert

00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,159
with sticky notes on a timeline frame

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,669
handling events okay what is going to

00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:27,869
happen what triggers these events really

00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:29,549
trying to figure out what is your

00:18:27,869 --> 00:18:31,889
business process and very interesting

00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:34,200
because a lot of times even the business

00:18:31,889 --> 00:18:36,149
people itself won't agree in the

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,070
beginning on how the process works and

00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:40,559
afterward to figure out oh this is how

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,850
this works I didn't know that and maybe

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,840
they are working there for a couple of

00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:47,549
years I think Ana and PHP CC itself can

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,070
tell you most heard about that they have

00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:51,809
some stories where even the CEO didn't

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,879
really know how the process was working

00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:55,980
he was thinking it was working like that

00:18:53,879 --> 00:18:58,080
and the business people itself for

00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,279
thinking worked like this but they both

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,409
were wrong it was working completely

00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,240
different so this is really helpful to

00:19:01,409 --> 00:19:05,369
just figure out what is going on and

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,779
what you want your chief for existing

00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:09,749
business processes but also for a new

00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:12,779
one because you more less visualize the

00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:14,249
ideas the stakeholder has and helps you

00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:15,779
as a developer as well to understand

00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:18,809
what is going on there what are really

00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:22,049
the important parts and coming back to

00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:24,659
DD it makes easy to find these domain

00:19:22,049 --> 00:19:26,399
boundaries like okay this is handling

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:28,960
the follow for examples the check out

00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:30,460
and okay now the order start like

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,860
this handles tripping everything this

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,000
was just standing the basket so there

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,970
are different domains that are

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,470
completely different from how I need to

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,370
handle them suffice not as well if I

00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,320
want to do DDD and also what are the

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,630
domain language res the domain language

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,070
the customer use so I understand what

00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:50,760
they are thinking and how they handled

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,840
us I gather if you have the same

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,810
glossary the same we used to use the

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,880
same wording like the business people it

00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:59,500
makes it much much easier to communicate

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,230
with them if you are using different

00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,140
language on our site in our application

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,910
in the software it's much much harder if

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:09,580
you run into problems to communicate

00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,260
what your problem is because you may

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,590
using the same word with a completely

00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,630
different meaning any of you who a said

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,550
the situation you're talking to someone

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:20,200
about something and later on you figure

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,220
out you use both the same word but we're

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:28,450
talking about completely different

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:30,040
things it's yeah happens so now imagine

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,230
you're writing application this happens

00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,820
so you are thinking you know what he

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:39,580
means but you're doing something could

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:41,560
be different this is not that good

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,250
there's an other method because I'm

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:49,710
quite fast it seems we can talk a lot

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:51,970
about so I will take some time for that

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,800
it's a workshop I'm doing for a couple

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,690
of years now I really enjoyed because a

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,490
lot of fun it's like they're doing a

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,400
developer workshop about architecture

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:03,600
for one or two days without laptop

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,800
computer anything just a white bar and

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,700
in the beginning when I started with us

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,230
it was yeah okay we're doing

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,700
architecture and hello also a lot of

00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,590
team thing it's what I he texture but

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,570
you start to figure out it's a lot about

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,820
requirements

00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:20,680
the idea behind I take your cutters is

00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:22,810
you get a very small set of requirements

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,660
and written form maybe just a small

00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,280
paragraph and then you get one and a

00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,200
half two hours whatever you need for

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,200
that to create an architecture vision

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:39,790
sounds easy enough so we start and it's

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,640
like okay how do I get from a paragraph

00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:44,440
of text was probably missing information

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,930
to something I would call an

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:52,090
architecture vision how would you do

00:21:46,930 --> 00:22:08,770
that you were looking at you did ah he

00:21:52,090 --> 00:22:10,840
takes a cut out before so yeah there's a

00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:12,220
nice thing in this that you throw stuff

00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,460
on a white pot and then delete it or

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,110
wipe it away when I do this workshop had

00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,780
customers on the tell me oh no we don't

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:20,440
have why pottery a flipchart it's the

00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,170
same right

00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,460
well um the problem is a flip chalice or

00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,140
what a lot of text and then figure out

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,940
something is wrong because I figured out

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:31,000
all the requirements were different or

00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,780
this isn't working what do I do if a

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,610
flip shot fall off text I would probably

00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,410
strike something do some arrows or no

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:40,090
this was meaning here if you do this a

00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,530
couple of times you remember the kind

00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,290
the beginning it looked like that it's

00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:46,270
like yeah it's probably correct but

00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,940
nobody understands that anymore and you

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:51,040
want to do it again so for me a flip

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,230
chart or planning on a flip chart that's

00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,730
the same as writing code you will not

00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:57,160
throw it away because you put effort in

00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,140
there if you've developed code for two

00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,760
months and you figure out oh this is

00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,560
wrong you will not throw it away because

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,450
you put so much time and so much effort

00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,220
in there if you do it on a whiteboard

00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:09,430
you just wipe out the path that's wrong

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,230
and write it again so that's why I

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,160
really like to have white pots and the

00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:16,810
whole idea for architecture cutters

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,500
small story about that there was a book

00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:24,160
in the 70s musical men month prefer

00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:27,100
about that it's book on Frederick Brooks

00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:31,600
back in the days of a Frederick jr. it's

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:36,940
really old it's 7075 read it it's

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:39,070
totally up to our current situations and

00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:41,110
there was one chapter in their plan to

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:42,400
throw one away so they in the 70s I

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,950
already knew the first version of

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,020
everything you will build it's not good

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:49,090
so plan to throw it away

00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:53,830
let's also the idea what you're

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:57,720
prototyping and everything so a lot of

00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:57,720
stuff in there still completely

00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:04,720
feasible for our times in 2010 he wrote

00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:07,300
another book design of design in English

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,590
and it was interesting because he was

00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,200
not only talking about software design

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,400
but also about building a house and the

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,900
architecture involved was building a

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,460
house and he figured out that if you

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,700
talk about design and architecture in

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:22,270
these different scenarios you still talk

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,010
about the same things and then he was

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:26,400
asking ok how do we get great designers

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,450
think about stuff like Apple for example

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,010
you can say a lot of bad things about

00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,620
Apple but the design expecially for the

00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,150
first iPhone everything was really nice

00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,210
but how do you get people to be great

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,880
designers said great is honest design of

00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:41,680
course so they have a lot of experience

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,660
they do it all the time and they have a

00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,310
lot running in there they did a lot of

00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:51,820
mistakes before so they know what's

00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:56,550
correct and in 2012 Tecna work on some

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:59,200
conference in u.s. was asking kay

00:24:56,550 --> 00:25:01,840
applying this to software retexture how

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,060
do we get greatly a great architects if

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,660
most of them do it a couple of times

00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:10,360
like half dozen times in a lifetime if

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:12,760
you do a big application the

00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,470
architecture planning takes some time

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,260
then the product itself probably takes

00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:18,760
some years to get finished so how often

00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,190
do you do that really for big

00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:22,480
application not that often when maybe

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,770
your position has changed in the

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,720
meanwhile so you're not even doing

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,040
architecture stuff anymore so once you

00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,810
have some experience you're not doing it

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,740
anymore

00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:31,240
so he came up with the idea of

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,450
architecture cutters so let's if we

00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,000
don't do this and our real job enough to

00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,800
get experience with us means every time

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,690
we need to do it we probably don't have

00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,210
the experience that we really need to be

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:47,710
able to do it good so we need to train

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:50,440
that code cutters are probably well now

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,900
who doesn't know code cut off who

00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,000
doesn't know Kolkata code cutters like

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,670
to take a very small example of code and

00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,160
an idea and write it down and try to

00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:05,980
solve it in different ways the most

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:08,410
famous one is a fist pass like you have

00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,419
to count from 0 to 100 and every number

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:14,129
that you can divide by 3

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:17,769
you print out fist every number you're /

00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:19,149
5/5 you pronoun bus and for something

00:26:17,769 --> 00:26:21,489
like 15 we are three and five as

00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:23,440
possible pronoun fist bus there's a

00:26:21,489 --> 00:26:27,759
website with over 100 solutions to the

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,950
problem you can learn new IDs new

00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,539
languages new programming styles I

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,799
always use them for like TDD pair

00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:35,859
programming and because they are really

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,639
small simple ideas where you can train

00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:43,359
stuff with and the same idea here there

00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:46,119
is a bigger we try to train and get a

00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,769
gap feeling how do we do this how much

00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,769
planning do we need when do we start

00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:52,269
what questions do we need to ask to get

00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,070
a feeling how can we evolve from

00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:57,820
something that's missing information

00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:00,009
that's not a person correct how much do

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,889
we need and where are the problems very

00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:05,470
often if you're doing any texture stuff

00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:07,450
and you're planning something as a

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:09,909
developer you have to do you have to

00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:13,840
take decisions or even make assumptions

00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:15,340
of something I'm asking again okay well

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,929
if you have been in a situation where

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,179
he's writing code and later on maybe

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:20,739
later on or even two point figure out we

00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,389
can do this way or that way but this

00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:25,350
will have a big business impact because

00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:27,970
it will change how the customer reacts

00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,739
the most important part of this because

00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:31,679
where you had to figure that out at that

00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:34,749
point

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:37,600
you always have architectural decisions

00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:39,369
ahead of you like I can invest more time

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,440
to make them more flexible or can take a

00:27:39,369 --> 00:27:44,739
shortcut and this would probably not as

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,600
flexible if you talk to a customer and

00:27:44,739 --> 00:27:48,129
tell him this I mean okay we Hank do you

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,869
have any plans to go further this

00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:52,720
direction because do you think about

00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:54,070
maybe not now but are there any plans in

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,379
your drawers or something that you will

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:58,539
do this in the next year do we need the

00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,619
flexibility later on or do you say no we

00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:01,509
will never need that we talked about

00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:04,779
that we're not going to happen can we

00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:06,399
skip this this is exactly what can

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,720
happen if you don't talk about that like

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,009
two months later he comes around since

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,749
we need this feature and you took the

00:28:09,009 --> 00:28:11,859
shortcut and now we need to refactor

00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:14,139
your whole application because you

00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:17,429
didn't talk about your business decision

00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:19,599
that you did in your architecture so you

00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,399
need to develop this gut feeling now I'm

00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,160
making a seasoned I'm taking assumption

00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:25,960
what's the right way to do this

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,669
and if you have this daily interaction

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,309
or more interaction with a customer you

00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:32,380
can ask them I have these two

00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:34,720
opportunities and this means this or

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:36,870
this means that you have to present them

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,770
as options not only saying should I do

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,380
strategy Petter to make it more flexible

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:43,780
or sure a duel just the quick and easy

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:45,820
way and code everything hard he will not

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:47,590
understand that but if you tell him we

00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,510
have two options we have option a let's

00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,630
take a little more time but keeps for

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,190
example the language in our shop

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:56,289
flexible how do you have any plans to

00:28:54,190 --> 00:29:00,460
move your shop to another country to

00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:02,169
another language then we can you can

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,429
same but this will need more time or we

00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:05,169
have the different way we can do this

00:29:03,429 --> 00:29:06,520
quicker we will ignore this completely

00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:09,460
but if you ever want to do this we need

00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:10,780
to invest more time so it you know yeah

00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,090
he will say yes but you tell him okay

00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,150
let's cost money for you so you need to

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:18,909
give him the consequences and the

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:20,169
business values behind these two

00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:22,690
opportunities so he can make a business

00:29:20,169 --> 00:29:25,780
decision if you tell him yeah I can do

00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:28,179
the flexible way or the quick way he

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,470
will always right but this is not the

00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:31,330
business really behind this you have to

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,669
time okay this cost more time and a

00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,620
little bit money but will enable you to

00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:38,590
do that later I are there any plans for

00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:42,190
that this will curve will be faster we

00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:44,650
can go online earlier but if you change

00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,049
your opinion we need to escape it and we

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:49,330
probably have a problem the benefit is

00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,039
if he ever changes this mind you can say

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,960
we talked about that so okay now we need

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,820
more time for that so you have arguments

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,630
to even say okay we need a refactoring

00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:01,390
now so it's really really hard and what

00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,980
a texture cut has helped your trading to

00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,570
develop this gut feeling how much

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,080
information do I need when you need to

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:12,280
start it's fun when I do this training

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,750
for the first time with teams and if we

00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,240
only focus on one day like we're doing

00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,159
three runs three cut off per day in the

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:20,590
first one I can say okay here's the

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,690
example I pick a very easy one which are

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:25,570
no very good and I know all the

00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,890
questions I should come up with and I

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,960
had a company where I was doing this

00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:31,120
training with and there were like three

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,390
or four teams with three or four people

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,980
each and I'm the perfect custom on that

00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,540
regard I'm running around I'm asking

00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,929
them do we have any question because I

00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,490
as a more

00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:42,129
writer of silly Aitor and playing the

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:43,450
stakeholder and playing the the other

00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:45,909
department not playing everything

00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,619
everyone you need to ask so I'm really

00:30:45,909 --> 00:30:49,720
perfect I'm obviously I'm asking you do

00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:52,480
you have any questions stuff like never

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,389
happens in real life and they were

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:58,600
saying no oh no no no we know what to do

00:30:55,389 --> 00:31:00,279
I could actually go downstairs and play

00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,600
a kicker or a football because there was

00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:03,070
nothing for me to do for one and a half

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,340
hours because they telling me no no we

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,379
don't need you go away I know that was a

00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:10,360
big problem once they presented

00:31:08,379 --> 00:31:12,460
solutions was asking Katie to think

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,230
about this did you verify that this is

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,549
correct what you did there did you ask

00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,539
the customer if you really wants that

00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:18,070
what you're building there you know

00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:21,580
you're making business decisions on that

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:24,490
case I don't know why oh we should have

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,320
asked oh okay yeah the second iteration

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,999
they were asking me all the time I was

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,830
sitting with one team and the other two

00:31:27,999 --> 00:31:32,619
teams were waiting in the door for me to

00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:34,779
get finished these questions they were

00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:36,519
not really they were only as they were

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:39,490
asking any questions everything I came

00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:43,059
up every small detail they were kind of

00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:45,460
afraid to do something assume something

00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:46,600
they didn't verify so they never give

00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:49,119
really get to the point where they could

00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:52,389
create an architecture they were still

00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,889
busy with figuring out how they any they

00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:55,749
were like you really ask me are there

00:31:53,889 --> 00:31:56,799
any more question we should ask though I

00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:59,399
don't know what you're doing what are

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,499
you trying to do I don't know

00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:04,090
so learning for that was okay you need

00:32:02,499 --> 00:32:05,320
to find the way where you need to stop

00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:07,659
where you think you have enough

00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,190
information to get started we are HR so

00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,769
we know there will be changes but we

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,480
need to have the foundation the the real

00:32:11,769 --> 00:32:14,740
important things figure out before we

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,600
start but we don't need to figure out

00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,299
every detail then we would be back at

00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,970
waterfall and that doesn't work so in

00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:25,179
the search iteration we treat our okay

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:27,249
take a defined time time box like 15 to

00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:28,840
20 minutes figure out what you need to

00:32:27,249 --> 00:32:31,029
do ask this question later on and then

00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,279
take at least one hour to really get

00:32:31,029 --> 00:32:36,179
into architecture and if you have

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,230
figured out the first few floors and the

00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,379
requirements or first few things you're

00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:42,639
missing you probably have a solid base

00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:46,059
already where you can start on and

00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,139
everything that comes later is hopefully

00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:49,179
just a small detail

00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:52,889
you didn't miss you might still miss a

00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:52,889
big thing but yeah

00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,660
instead before I think Fred Brooks

00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,340
looking at this plane to throw away

00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,230
chapter in this first book I always tell

00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,990
the teams I want them to throw away if

00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:07,090
the first three or four versions but on

00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:08,710
a whiteboard because everything you

00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:09,880
build after that will be much better

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:15,370
than the first version you would have

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:17,620
been built so getting to some

00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:19,540
recommendation what can you do if you're

00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,790
going to plan something you need to

00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,140
understand or if you're going to develop

00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:27,450
something you need to understand the

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:29,590
problem the problem with that is really

00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:31,030
you need to get a gut feeling and need

00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,260
to train your gut feeling lower do I

00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:34,450
understand the problem to have all

00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,920
informations I need so try to develop

00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,160
this gut feeling how much information do

00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,070
I need

00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:41,860
do I have a feeling I know enough or is

00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:43,000
that still something for you or for your

00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,590
team for someone else on your team

00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,860
that's just I don't know if I really get

00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:49,660
this if someone is there take another

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,830
round sit together discuss it again and

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,270
try to figure out there might be

00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:54,070
something missing and it might be the

00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:57,190
really important part so try to

00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,930
understand the problem for us after that

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,340
you can think about solution okay we

00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,950
have the problem now how can we solve

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,410
this what can we do to really solve the

00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,110
problem this might be something that is

00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:09,520
not really software development maybe we

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,100
can tell the customer wait if you do

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,900
this or change this we do you don't need

00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,700
a new project you don't need a new

00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,260
application maybe we can do a quick fix

00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,970
or something really easy for your old

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,110
application or maybe you can just change

00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:22,000
your process internally if you

00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:23,680
understand the process well maybe it's

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,900
much easier to change something in there

00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:28,770
some communication between apartments

00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,770
and that will solve all your problems

00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:35,260
the software should always be the last

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:37,360
resort for rigor because it takes a lot

00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,180
of money a lot of time they're offered

00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,070
effort and a lot of things can go wrong

00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,050
but that's where we come in if you

00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,570
figure out okay we want to automate

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,520
something I want to find a solution then

00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:49,810
think about how we can implement this

00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,190
this is where the architecture and

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,140
everything comes in play now we have the

00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,600
solution we have this business process

00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,280
figured out also the nice thing about

00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,870
like doing it on a white bar is after

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,970
you have a solution or wipe or at least

00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,310
a draft on the whiteboard you can roll

00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,990
this against the requirements and

00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,490
against the process and figure out okay

00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,760
does

00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:10,890
solution really fulfill this process you

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,170
can run it through all the use cases

00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:14,490
user stories and see okay can we solve

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,850
this problem with this if it looks good

00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,440
yeah okay maybe we can start and then

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:23,670
you have really at least a good

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,770
foundation for application some other

00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:27,660
things to keep in mind

00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:30,510
coding is really not necessarily the

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,530
most important or productive thing of

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:37,140
your time meetings can be boring

00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:39,360
meetings can be a time waste but really

00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,160
sitting together and trying to

00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:43,410
understand everything is much more

00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,130
productive than oh we don't have time

00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:49,800
let's start coding every time you start

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,630
something new a feature what ever ask

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:56,340
yourself if you really understand what

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:58,290
you're going to do here good and

00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:00,240
frequent communication is important not

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,980
only between stakeholders and your team

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,810
but also was in the team if don't talk

00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:06,260
to your colleagues maybe you're

00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:08,760
developing both some different direction

00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,420
another example from this car he takes a

00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,100
cut a thing

00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,050
there was one cutter where I told them

00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,990
okay you have a shop system a shopping

00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:17,580
cart and there was an API to you you

00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,640
need to develop an API to a different

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:23,369
department responsible for shipping the

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,140
question I was expecting was okay what

00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:27,300
kind of format does the department need

00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:28,890
what should we do like in real a few

00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,500
watch discussed with the other apartment

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,810
department okay how what would be API

00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,060
look like what do you need Jason do you

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:40,200
need XML whatever and they were just

00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,180
even everything like this but they were

00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,710
not asking they were just doing it and

00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,380
had some later okay did you talk to the

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:50,910
other Department how the API specified

00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,560
no we just did XML why yeah maybe they

00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,960
can't handle don't want to handle that

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,800
maybe they have other api's themself

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,300
already so communication is important to

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,150
other departments to everyone involved

00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,550
to the stakeholder try to get a quick

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,680
feedback loop you either earlier you get

00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:09,780
the customer involved into our ideas

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,340
into your solutions the earlier you get

00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:13,410
feedback that he figures out he doesn't

00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:15,480
he need something different because this

00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:17,130
might happen this will happen so if you

00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,690
build for two months and then the show

00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,530
to the customer and then he figures out

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:22,619
now it's

00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:26,490
we need something else yeah not that

00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:28,800
good and plan to throw some away on a

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:32,670
white bottle if possible or maybe you

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,470
can do a prototype to just think about

00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:36,839
your ideas to verify your own ideas

00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:38,640
maybe you need to might do a spike to

00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,890
verify if the solutions even working

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,839
technically but you need to plan to

00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,630
solve some way because if you start

00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:48,839
implementing everything for real at the

00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:52,530
first iteration it probably will not be

00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,050
that good and yeah this is a lot of

00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:56,910
talking about planning and again this is

00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,880
not water for thinking back about this

00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:03,150
the key values yes all these

00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,339
interactions and working software is

00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:07,230
very good but there's still value and

00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:09,089
planning but you need to develop the

00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:11,190
Scout feeling and train yourself how

00:38:09,089 --> 00:38:12,950
much time do you need you don't want to

00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,060
plan everything and have like this

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,710
waterfall II I hate actually you say

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,420
okay we do it we completely just

00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,250
implementing this solution now and there

00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:22,500
will be no change for that there will be

00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:25,980
change that will be smaller change over

00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:28,260
bigger change it's unavoidable but at

00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,910
least try to get as much information as

00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,780
you can before us so you can plan as

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:37,050
much as you need not more not less

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,400
that's the hard part and that's where I

00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:39,869
can really recommend stuff like

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,369
architecture cutters to train these

00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:46,800
things because we don't do it often

00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:48,150
enough in real life and then you

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,119
probably can turn around the sentence

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:53,460
and you have hours of planning will save

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,869
you weeks of coding so that's the way we

00:38:53,460 --> 00:39:01,880
want it and I think I'm good on time so

00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,880
thank you any questions

00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:19,730
I think we've like 5 hours left for any

00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:19,730
questions if not then thank you feedback

00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,270
the question was if I'm using UML for

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,940
planning my software I don't really care

00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:34,860
what you use the Technica - Oh see that

00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,880
there's really a lot of value in some

00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,050
kind of diagrams

00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,740
I don't really tell the people use UML

00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:43,020
anymore

00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:45,870
you can use it they are something there

00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,030
was a block person I forgot the name he

00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,550
was ranting about UML because how many

00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:56,310
human diagrams do most of you know on

00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:58,200
use do you you oh yeah

00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:00,900
3 F 3 or 4 near us when Tina humilis

00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,500
least 15 or 16 UML diagrams but you only

00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:05,910
need like user stories use case diagrams

00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:07,680
maybe components diagrams something like

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:10,380
activity diagram or something and class

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,140
diagrams so let Pedley most of the

00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,130
things to meet until a ship may be and

00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,020
he was

00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,480
yes sequence or activity is like

00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,520
interchangeable he was ranting about

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,290
that did so many stuff in there and so

00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:24,750
much notation details you need to know

00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,940
and he was when he wrote on a cup of

00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:30,720
years later he came up with c4 model

00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,550
talk it's like the ideas like a Google

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,960
Maps you have this bigger picture where

00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,780
if you're zoomed out and you're more you

00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,890
zoom in the more detail you get if you

00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,090
have different information on the

00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,350
different layers like on the lowest

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,360
level you have Google Street View and

00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:45,360
the highest level you maybe see only the

00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,010
continent so maybe the country lines

00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,740
something and if we go our deepest you

00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:51,300
Street and everything else so you have

00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,550
different layers for different

00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:55,350
information and his idea was see for was

00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,540
like we are zooming from the outside in

00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:59,250
he changed a little bit now I have to

00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,140
look it up but in the beginning it was

00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:03,840
like the highest picturesque context

00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,170
like the system what are our main

00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:09,420
systems involved here then if you zoom

00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:12,270
down into one system or one context you

00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,680
get what components are in there okay no

00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:15,660
he was going over containers I mean you

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,020
in there I would call it services but

00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:19,720
service is this

00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:22,240
thing using and then what components are

00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,830
was in the service or container and at

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:31,060
the lowest ever what classes are in the

00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:35,140
component C for model doc what I does

00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,790
come order come here sorry it's really

00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,890
interesting because it's a really damp

00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:43,470
down UML event storming is a way to also

00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:47,010
figure out at least in the beginning

00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:49,990
what your processes and you can kind of

00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,750
abstract user stories from these and go

00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:54,550
into architecture planning I now pitch

00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,230
PCC also located only all the other

00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,630
stuff I just used a when's Tommy because

00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:01,180
they are probably recommend to seek us

00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,860
anyway I want to have it completely

00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,390
separated from the architecture solution

00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,680
so I don't care what he textured

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,820
solution will be I want to have

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,070
something that will show me the business

00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,960
process and in the next step I want to

00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:12,520
see what is the technical solution

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,650
architecture solution to solve this

00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,110
problem so I would start maybe with

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,250
event storming use this as a base to

00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:20,650
understand the pros and then use

00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:23,230
something like c4 or something to try to

00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,930
dump down like starting at the top and

00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:28,840
going down into more details because I'm

00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,970
planning one problem develops were a lot

00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,650
of times have as like I said was a focus

00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,330
they are talking about implementation

00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,680
detail or specific cases when you're

00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,200
just talking about what service do you

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,220
need and if there's a lot of times we

00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,720
were talking about what service do you

00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,730
need yeah but you need to remind

00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,800
remember that we need this special case

00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:46,870
and that occasion yeah okay but that

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,280
implementation detail that will be part

00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:50,890
of the service but I don't care because

00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,450
it doesn't influence what service learn

00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,880
it I don't want to care if this

00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:56,830
influenced my services what this means I

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,620
have a completely different separation

00:42:56,830 --> 00:43:01,390
of concerns I have a problem there so I

00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,510
like the c-4 model because it really

00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:05,740
lets you start at the top and then go

00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:07,330
deeper and deeper and you can really say

00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,710
okay now it's enough information I have

00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:10,060
and I can start with that

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,690
because most of the times don't in your

00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,690
class diagram

00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:49,800
the questions if like the CEO of your

00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:52,020
agency is planning and software

00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:54,030
something should you as a developer

00:43:52,020 --> 00:44:00,060
should develop a support team and

00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:01,770
planning estimating I would say to

00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:04,230
certain degree yes of course because

00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:05,970
planning as a developer we have we can

00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,580
say okay there some certain restrictions

00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:10,890
technical wise we need to at least tell

00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:14,760
them if he's planning or calculating the

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:16,950
cost I know we all have we are

00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,300
developers we all know that we do we

00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:20,190
have a big problem with estimating stuff

00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,980
and there are the big problem with

00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,900
estimating stuff in general yes but they

00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,240
I would I was involved in the situation

00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,530
a couple of times in my career if you

00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:31,200
have a senior developers we can at least

00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:33,360
at least try to put on these business

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,010
classes as well and seed from a business

00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:37,440
standpoint there's a lot of value in

00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:39,240
there but you need to make sure that the

00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,560
developers not focusing on an

00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,730
appreciation teachers already but you

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,770
need to really say okay are there

00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,660
anything technical is what we need to

00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,550
really care of there are a lot of other

00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:48,930
good talks that show you the estimation

00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:50,640
doesn't work and how it doesn't work and

00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:53,580
why it doesn't work so I will not go

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,800
into that but I think if you have a good

00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,170
CEO he understands that as well and you

00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,060
as a technical specialist or whatever

00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,920
can support him in these things

00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,190
so that's value now and there I would

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,770
say yes I would I will not say that will

00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:10,730
always work and it will always be

00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:17,550
perfect but in general I would say yes

00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:19,950
any other questions okay thank you as

00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:21,900
said before feedback on Twitter if you

00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,640
want and I like feedback if you liked it

00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,940

00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:28,300
improve thank you

00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:33,239
[Applause]
