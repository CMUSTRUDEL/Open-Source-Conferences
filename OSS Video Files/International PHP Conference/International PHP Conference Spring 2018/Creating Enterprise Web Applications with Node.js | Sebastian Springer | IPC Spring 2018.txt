Description: 
	Sebastian Springer (MaibornWolff GmbH): Node.js is a lightweight but yet capable platform for creating powerful web applications. The core of Node.js is kept small and restricted to a limited functionality that is extended by a vast ecosystem. With the right combination of packages you are able to build full-featured web applications. There is nearly no limit in features starting with simple problems such as authentication or logging over web interfaces with REST or GraphQL to a whole application based on a microservices architecture. In this talk I will introduce you to some commonly used packages and show you how to use them by example.
