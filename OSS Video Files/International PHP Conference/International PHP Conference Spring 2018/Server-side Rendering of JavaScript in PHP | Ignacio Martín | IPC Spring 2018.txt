Title: Server-side Rendering of JavaScript in PHP | Ignacio Martín | IPC Spring 2018
Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2018
Description: 
	Ignacio Martín (Limenius): With the explosion of front-end libraries like React and Vue.js, there is the advantage of being able to render JavaScript applications directly from the server instead of waiting for the browser to render them. This is beneficial for SEO and means a faster presentation of the content to the user. There is much information about how to do this in Node.js, but can we render a React or Vue.js application from a PHP server? What techniques do we have available? What are the benefits and trade-offs of each one? We will present the work that we have been doing in the past few years in libraries like ReactRenderer, ReactBundle and phpexecjs, and will see points to take care about when doing a deep integration between PHP and modern frameworks.
