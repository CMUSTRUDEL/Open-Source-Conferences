Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2018
Description: 
	Daniel Rotter (Sulu): Time is one of the most valuable resources in today’s society – and the internet is no exception for that. Users don’t like to wait for content, and they are gone faster than you might realise. On the other side a website should adapt to its visitors in every possible way which makes caching web pages one of the most important topics for developers these days. In my talk I will cover the issue of caching content for special target groups on a website and give a short overview of the basics about HTTP caching. I will also show how to implement a caching solution capable of handling different representations for different users with Symfony and its HTTP cache resp. Varnish.
