Title: PHP reviews for busy people | Damien Seguy | IPC Spring 2018
Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2018
Description: 
	Damien Seguy (Exakat): Everyone fear the review of his own code. And to start with, there is no time. Because, what will happen once we have found something to detail ? In fact, a good code review means being ready to discuss a mere few lines, assess the context and evaluate an alternative, or not. It also means that when the code has become a dense jungle, there may hide monsters worse than a few errors. Using automated tools that are not scared by volume, weâ€™ll keep everything under control, without anyone else knowing about it.
