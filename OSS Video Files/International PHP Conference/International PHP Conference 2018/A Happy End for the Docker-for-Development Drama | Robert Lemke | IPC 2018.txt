Description: 
	When Docker hit the scene, many developers started using containers as a lightweight alternative to virtual machines. It was promising to use Docker as a local environment for development which would closely match the software running on the production servers. But the cake was a lie, all sorts of practical issues spoiled the fun.â€‹

In this session Robert Lemke (Flownative GmbH) shares what he learned throughout the last four years of using Docker as a development (and production) environment and how you can create your own set-up taking full advantage of the benefits containers provide.
