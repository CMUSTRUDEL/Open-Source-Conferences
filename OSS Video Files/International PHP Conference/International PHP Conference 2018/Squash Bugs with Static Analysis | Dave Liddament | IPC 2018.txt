Description: 
	Dave Liddament (Lamp Bristol): All developers know that bugs are bad and finding them can be difficult. The good news is that tools to help us find and prevent them are becoming more powerful. Modern static analysis tools (like Psalm, Phan and PHPStan) are far more advanced than their predecessors. They can find a whole range of bugs whilst keeping the false positive rate low. This talk introduces more advanced static analysis. It will show the kinds of bugs that the more advanced static analysis tools can find. We’ll then look at how they can be added to your current development work flow. Finally, we’ll look at how we can write our code in a way to get the most out of static analysis.
