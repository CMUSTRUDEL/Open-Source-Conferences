Playlist: International PHP Conference 2018
Description: 
	Marcus Bointon (Synchromedia Limited): PHP 7.2 includes the libsodium cryptography library by default in the base language – the first time that a popular language has shipped with strong, modern crypto support as standard. Everyone can build secure apps without the risks of rolling their own crypto or using outdated libraries. So what’s in libsodium? What kind of things can you do? What risks remain? You’ll get a tour of cryptographic functions, how they have been done in the past, and how to switch to libsodium to give you a security edge.
