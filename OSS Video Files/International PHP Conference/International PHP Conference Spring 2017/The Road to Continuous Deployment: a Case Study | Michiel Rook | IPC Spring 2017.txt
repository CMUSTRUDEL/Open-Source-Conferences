Description: 
	Michiel Rook (make.io): It’s a situation many of us are familiar with: a large legacy, monolithic application, limited or no tests, slow and manual release process, low velocity, no confidence… A lot of refactoring is required, but management keeps pushing for new features. How to proceed? Using examples and lessons learned from a real-world case, I’ll show you how to replace a legacy application with a modern service-oriented architecture and build a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to deliver value from the first sprint. On the way, we’ll take a look at the process, automated testing, monitoring, master/trunk based development and various tips and best practices.
