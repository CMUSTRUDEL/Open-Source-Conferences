Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2017
Description: 
	Victoria Quirante (Limenius): Built around the HTTP specification, Symfony components provide a rock solid foundation for building RESTful APIs, whether we are using the full framework or not. In this session we will dig into those components, showing how to successfully deal with problems such as adapting our models to the desired representations back and forth, how to validate the incoming data, or how to implement our authentication strategies. Furthermore, we will see which additional tools do we have when using the full framework, as well as some tips and tricks to effectively test our APIs. All of it from a practical approach based upon real use cases.
