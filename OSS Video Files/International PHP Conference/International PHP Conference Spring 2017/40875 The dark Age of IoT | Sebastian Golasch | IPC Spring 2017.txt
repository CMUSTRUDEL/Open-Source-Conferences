Title: 40875 The dark Age of IoT | Sebastian Golasch | IPC Spring 2017
Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2017
Description: 
	Sebastian Golasch (Deutsche Telekom): Advertisements suggest that we are zenith of mankind’s scientific knowledge and technological power, but when it comes to IoT and the so called “Smart Home”, we are clearly not. In fact, we are in the middle of the dark age. In this talk, I will go deep in to the rabbit hole of todays “Smart Home” protocols, explain why device interoperability is a myth and tell you why the open source community is our only hope of having an secure and literally smart “Smart Home“ experience.

00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:14,940
all right so actually if you've read the

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,300
session description instead of the

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,760
promise talk that I held a couple of

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,220
times in the past I took the time and

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,300
there's a brand-new one for this

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:31,109
occasion here so it's a bit less techy

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,079
it's a bit less code I would call it the

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,350
four piece if I didn't despise that term

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,739
- whatever

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,870
instead of like really going down and

00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,640
showing how I've implemented protocols

00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,360
and what protocols for the smart home

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,739
system are made of I actually just want

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,700
to share some of the pain and

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:53,039
frustration

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,940
we as implementers of smart home

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,370
solutions feel and hopefully give you a

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:03,420
better picture about the state where we

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:05,970
are now where we're heading and what

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:12,119
this friggin IOT smart home thingy is

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,700
actually about but wait this is me I'm

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,950
Sebastian I work at Deutsche Telekom as

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,950
I don't know that they gave me that

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,040
title and probably just because they

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,960
want to have like folding cards I can

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,490
hand out to people so it's long enough

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,710
that actually makes sense I've been in

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,770
development for roughly 13 years and for

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,400
the past five and a half years I'm only

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:42,990
working in the IOT department of dodgy

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:45,240
telecom for our smart home solution if

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,649
you have any questions you can reach me

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,399
via Twitter at askew disco or via the

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,640
old way

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,310
via email question at Oscar disco comm

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:59,640
don't go to ask a disco comm there's

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,799
nothing to see you see like how it is

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,390
with private home pages you never get

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:09,720
them done so I'll just left a blank

00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,150
actually starting from today I'm also

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,660
not only developer I'm also responsible

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:19,740
for developer relations so in the future

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,200
if you want to play around whether SDKs

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,360
maybe get some hardware to play around

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,590
with if you have good ideas you want to

00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,080
implement please contact me because that

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,400
is probably what I will do from today on

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,920
getting in touch with developers I said

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,060
I'm working for Deutsche Telekom's smart

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,280
home platform it's still called Kiva

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,630
Khan although this brand name will

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,550
vanish in the future and we not only

00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:53,730
built this product for Deutsche Telekom

00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:56,310
we built a product that is actually a

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,170
platform that integrates various smart

00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,030
home protocols and offer that as a

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,900
viable solution to our other partners

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:07,200
like kpn and the Netherlands or Ian BW

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,630
so if you're a customer in BW and buy

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,430
their smart home package basically it's

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,709
the same technology it's the same

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,230
hardware and software as we as the

00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,890
telecom are distributing or kpn and

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:23,220
netherlands is distributing under their

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:27,180
brand name before we actually get to the

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,280
meet I'd wanted to just raise awareness

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,170
for a side project of mine which is the

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,930
nightly build conference and Cologne

00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,230
happening on the 1st of September for

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:42,690
the fourth time this year and if you're

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,420
into front-end stuff I think you are

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,120
because you're in the JavaScript rack

00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:50,880
it's might worth taking a look at

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:54,180
nightly but that I oh ok that is

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,860
basically enough marketing let's get to

00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:02,280
the meeting I've recently beginning of

00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,500
this month I wasn't Seattle and I

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,840
grasped some interest in the history of

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,540
Seattle and I think that's the history

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,799
of Seattle at least for the 19th century

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:19,739
can be described as a huge failure why

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:24,410
is that you see this isn't a

00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:28,740
terr of early 19th century Seattle and

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:33,020
basically the houses and everything they

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:36,479
are built directly at the coastline and

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,300
CLO isn't directly ad at the ocean it's

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,910
what they at a sound what they call we

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:47,599
would call this fury but they still have

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:50,460
tide they're so high tide low tide and

00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:54,060
back in the 19th century there was no

00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:56,460
sewage system nothing so what did the

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,580
people of Seattle do they put all the

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:02,610
trash or the crap and Juana that they

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,000
want to get rid of and they just put it

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,970
in the water and that is no problem

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,810
because low tide yeah perfect everything

00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:14,759
is just going away just gone and with

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,319
high tide the problem was everything

00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,979
just came back and this is a picture of

00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,159
it later

00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:25,860
this is what they called a street back

00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:28,620
in the days so nothing that we would

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:34,080
describe as a street today it was

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:39,150
basically Matt and because of high tide

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:44,909
it was Matt with litter and how to put

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:46,560
this toilet products in it you see those

00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:51,120
this vans here they're basically

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,330
drowning in the mat and before Seattle

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,110
was like this big technology city with

00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:01,710
Boeing and Microsoft and Amazon they

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:05,580
were actually in the logging business so

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:10,259
not cabanas dialoguing more like log

00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,330
stash logging and so they had this great

00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,909
idea like incrementally improving their

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:17,180
situation we have a lot of sawdust as a

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:20,099
by-product every logging industry and

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:23,789
what shall we do with it yeah let's put

00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:27,479
it on that muddy streets we think that

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:32,529
will help us actually it didn't help you

00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:36,309
see some like start sawdust stains here

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:38,729
it didn't help basically it looked like

00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:42,279
if you if you have chocolate pudding and

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:46,029
put cereal in it but it wasn't actually

00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:51,159
chocolate pudding so yeah the situation

00:06:46,029 --> 00:06:55,749
was was really worse until most of the

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:57,309
city burnt down in a great fire so 29

00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,329
blocks including the complete business

00:06:57,309 --> 00:07:00,159
district

00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:02,619
they've just burned down and because

00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:06,999
it's the us all the houses were wooden

00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:08,679
and well easy target for the fire but

00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:10,889
that actually gave CL a big opportunity

00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:14,529
and the mayor back then said I've

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,659
gathered all the experts we have a great

00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:19,029
plan we're going to rebuild the whole

00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:22,689
city we have proper streets we have a

00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:24,999
proper sewage system we will we'll build

00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:28,329
houses not out of wood we will build

00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:29,799
them out of stone and all the people in

00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:32,349
Siena they were very happy they said

00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:34,779
yeah perfect plan that's exactly what we

00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:39,249
need how long will it take and the mayor

00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:40,629
said ten years and all the people I mean

00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:42,189
like the whole business district burned

00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,499
down and all the people had businesses

00:07:42,189 --> 00:07:46,809
businesses there were like yeah we

00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:49,779
actually can't wait ten years for you to

00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:53,439
black build up the city from ground and

00:07:49,779 --> 00:07:55,209
started to well build up their houses

00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,829
again not out of wood out of stone

00:07:55,209 --> 00:08:02,709
because incrementally improving they've

00:07:56,829 --> 00:08:05,259
learned but all the parts that actually

00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:07,569
belong to the city so the streets they

00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:09,969
were haven't been touched in the early

00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:11,759
years so basically people rebuild their

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:15,429
houses their homes and their businesses

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:20,309
but everything the infrastructure part

00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:25,709
was as worse as it was before later then

00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:29,289
the city actually executed the plan and

00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:34,809
build the streets and they built them in

00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:38,860
a way that is safe for before the high

00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:42,129
tide so they I mean Americans seem to be

00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:43,959
great with building walls and what

00:08:42,129 --> 00:08:46,450
they've done they actually built the

00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:49,899
streets on top of walls

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:52,060
like free of 4 meters high so in the

00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:53,709
late 19th century if you're in if you

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,510
were in downtown Seattle and wanted to

00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:59,019
cross the street you actually had to

00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:00,700
climb up a ladder 3 to 5 meters cross

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,279
the street and on the other side climb

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,980
down a ladder just to cross the street

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,769
so it's basically they built actually

00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,350
walls in the streets that were the

00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:12,760
streets and I mean it's were super so

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,930
they have a proper sewage system built

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,550
in this hole thingy perfect but yeah

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,889
that was actually horrible user

00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,230
experience and what you see here is a

00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:26,070
picture of Seattle underground because

00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:30,910
what people then did was they adapted

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:33,610
those are actually the basement of the

00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:36,040
houses which are now the cellars because

00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,410
like the first story or the second story

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,350
sometimes now became the ground floor of

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:44,949
everything because people adapted and

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,779
they had already built houses and that

00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,510
was actually their plan so I've been

00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:52,510
down there it's a mess it's full with

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,370
rats and it's actually it's a pain to

00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:57,820
maintain for the city of Seattle

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,709
because it's like those were the streets

00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,660
before it was never meant to be a cellar

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:06,279
that were like the ground floors of the

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:09,100
buildings and yeah it smells horrible

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:12,820
they even build sometimes about little

00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:15,240
tiny windows up in the in the pavements

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,880
so when you walk over them you can

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:24,730
basically see down back in the old city

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:27,100
of Seattle at 3 or 4 there are actually

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:31,240
three or four parts of the city where

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,480
they did that so why am I telling you

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,310
this

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,949
I think in the smart home space we're

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,990
very close to the fire like if you

00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:43,209
compare that situation with the Seattle

00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:46,420
situation we're very close to the fire

00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:48,790
some people I say we're like right in

00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:51,459
front of it the big fire will vanish

00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:53,199
everything the bubble will burst some

00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:58,149
people say now we already survived a

00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:58,910
fire nevertheless we as implementers we

00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,420
have

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:04,370
some very impressive and good ideas we

00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:07,279
wanted to yeah implement and ship to the

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:11,750
people but technology and systems are

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,940
not there yet and we have unsatisfied

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,380
users because mostly when you go out and

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,990
buy a smart home today

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,959
what you expect is much higher than what

00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:24,440
you get that's just simply affect people

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:27,829
our users are unsatisfied we we have an

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,810
ecosystem that is fragmented like beyond

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:32,540
everything you know if you think

00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:34,970
JavaScript framework ecosystem is

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:40,490
fragmented look at smart home protocols

00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:43,910
and and vendors it's it's a mess the

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:46,160
thing is V as implementers is people who

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:50,540
build those solutions we need to fire up

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:54,170
a businesses we are in the need to sell

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:57,620
something today and we're basically we

00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:01,339
can't wait for 10 years to like finally

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:04,430
execute our plan and have something that

00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:07,819
we're all aiming at today and ship it to

00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:09,500
the user it's just simply it doesn't

00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:13,089
work we need to have a more or less

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:16,069
sustainable business today and this

00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:19,730
leads to situations and to products that

00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:22,250
look like this this is actually this is

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:26,180
from a Q free home attic

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:29,829
this is Europe's most popular smart home

00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:31,810
I would say automated home system

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:36,019
especially popular in every

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:38,120
german-speaking country so they're

00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:41,839
basically not available in the UK or in

00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,560
France but they sell so much here that

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:48,139
they're actually the becoming the most

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,860
popular and most sold system in the

00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:55,459
whole European nations also we've got

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,939
things like this this is FHM which is a

00:12:55,459 --> 00:13:02,350
Perl based system who writes for these

00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:05,380
days I don't know those people do and

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:08,089
you see that is this is one of the most

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:13,200
famous listing in the open-source space

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:15,720
that is used to control anything that

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,390
is nearly controllable you have people

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:23,730
who wire up things who are never meant

00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:27,480
to be wired up but they do it so I think

00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,550
we all can agree this as a user doesn't

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,610
look like you really want to touch it on

00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:35,550
everyday base especially not if you tag

00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:38,490
alike not the developers if you target

00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:42,720
the real users if you target your past

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:46,430
ones or whatever so I wanted to ask the

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,950
question what do we we and have been

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:54,560
developers think when I say IOT and a

00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:57,180
lot of things we mostly think about this

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,100
we think about devices will think about

00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:04,140
hardware boards and stuff like this so

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,450
platforms protocols whatever this is

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:11,370
what we as developers think of when I

00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:14,450
say hey yo IOT but the more interesting

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,850
question is what do we forget about and

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:21,780
most of the time I have to say it's this

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,280
it's the user because you've seen that

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:26,280
solutions you've seen the screenshots

00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:29,430
I've had here from the most used systems

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,550
and they're not very user friendly those

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:36,450
are highly technical and in our space

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:39,120
this is a huge problem we're building

00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:44,280
systems that actually that clash with

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,620
the user that build an horrible user

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:50,220
experience for extremely complex systems

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,030
and basically making our target

00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:55,020
experience

00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:58,860
tech person as the user and not I would

00:14:55,020 --> 00:15:02,610
say the regular human being we are

00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:05,160
actually expecting from people to have a

00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,470
deep technical technological background

00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:12,570
to in order to work with those systems

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:15,210
at least for most but what is at the

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,150
core of inventing new technology what is

00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:20,220
at the core of technology itself

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:23,910
actually if you think about technology

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:25,580
it should be invented to enable the user

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,720
to do something

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:32,510
it should make hard things easy and just

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:36,650
easy things vanish in the background so

00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:39,740
that you don't even notice them and in

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:42,260
order to do that we basically need to

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,300
understand we need to understand the two

00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:46,130
core circles that we're dealing with

00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,780
here on the one hand this is the

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:49,280
technology we need to have a deeply

00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,200
understanding of the deep understanding

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,390
of the technology and on the other hand

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,310
of course we need to understand our

00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,580
target audience and what our users

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:02,260
actually want and what we need to ship

00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:06,980
in order to enable all the regular users

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:10,160
to deal with our system and to enable

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,070
them to deal with complex technology in

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,380
an easy way

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:17,690
so I'll give you a free minute crash

00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:20,750
course and smart home protocols I'll

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,390
actually have another talk which I've

00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:25,160
included a link which deals very deeply

00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:29,210
with the topic and especially security

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,720
related questions of a few smart home

00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,390
protocols and said I've included a link

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,190
encourage you to watch it later on

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:40,180
because there might be some surprises in

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,850
it but now free minute crash course

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:50,120
protocols and what they do to the user

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:53,320
and protocols we have many we I don't

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,480
know I feel like a new protocol emerge

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,000
emerges every month on I don't know or

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,010
maybe every week because all that cool

00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,930
kickstarter and whatever products they

00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:05,839
start building their own protocol

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,850
proprietary no standard if there are

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,870
standards they mostly have like eleven

00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:11,240
sub protocols

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,600
hello ZigBee that are mostly

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,000
incompatible with each other and it's a

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:21,080
 show it's basically you probably

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,910
know that xkcd and this is exactly what

00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,760
we're dealing with I literally can

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:28,130
imagine like managers and developers in

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,960
in businesses like sitting down like

00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:35,810
yeah we could use that protocol but I

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,400
don't like particular thing X so we'll

00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:39,020
build a new protocol will be better than

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,850
the last one and this is what we're

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,810
dealing with

00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:46,780
it's a show also what this does to

00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:49,660
the user the user basically has to use

00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,090
like one app per smart device that

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:55,360
they're that they're buying so you have

00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:58,770
an edit mode that controls all that that

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,110
measures your room temperature humidity

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:05,260
whatever and you have a heating system

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,570
which probably could benefit from that

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:11,920
information but because they're speaking

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:18,520
totally different protocols bad luck no

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:20,620
way so what do we need to do this is

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,400
basically also I'm not a marketing

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:26,260
person but this was the idea of the

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,070
product we had our telecom build like to

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:34,150
consolidate the protocols which we can

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:37,000
do to some extent I said I'm not a

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:38,710
marketing person so we're not really

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,510
successful for that because we

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,860
implemented like a handful of protocols

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,080
and there is like a mountain of

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,920
protocols over there which we can't

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:53,100
speak or won't or will not implement

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,100
because of licensing issues whatever and

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,740
the thing is with all that protocols

00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:02,830
they're kind of like they're very

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,440
different so this is my short what the

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,990
protocol a lot of smart home protocols

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,720
if we speak about ZigBee and an ocean

00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:13,200
and hematocrit cars and home attic IP

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,370
and whatever they're basically

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,640
transmitting in the ice and frequency

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:20,890
band as M stands for industrial

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,850
scientific and medical band so it's

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:29,530
basically used in other branches as well

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:33,130
and they're mostly transmitted at 886 68

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:36,450
megahertz so this is for a bit cosette

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,810
wave and some of the ZigBee protocols

00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:42,880
only true for europe because in the US

00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,010
and in Canada it's different I also know

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,680
it's different in Japan so basically you

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,810
can't go to the US by z-wave or z-wave

00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,910
black plug there and use it here in

00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:53,250
Europe doesn't work because different

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,340
frequency

00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:59,190
of course you have things like Bluetooth

00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,490
Wi-Fi ZigBee transmitting at 2.45

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,640
gigahertz I said I've included ZigBee

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,160
twice there because ZigBee has 11 or 12

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,070
or maybe today it will be 13 sub

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,720
protocols that also transmit on

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:17,580
different frequencies

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:21,060
yes shitshow also the protocols they

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:24,810
organized differently so you have start

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:26,610
apologies for like Homeric or systems

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,400
like your Wi-Fi where you have one

00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:32,670
router one access point and you connect

00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,730
to it but if you look at ZigBee and

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:39,120
z-wave devices they actually build a

00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:42,780
mesh network which has the benefit of

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:48,050
extending the range but has the cost of

00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:52,050
a high latency and I've seen complex

00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:54,750
z-wave networks with 20-plus devices

00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:56,850
break down because one node was removed

00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:58,680
and taking up to eight minutes to

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,600
rebuild the network until it was finally

00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:03,210
reachable or every device was reachable

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,510
again because every device has its own

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:09,560
routing tables and they need to adapt if

00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:12,600
there's something changes and yeah I

00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:14,670
don't say start apologies are better for

00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,320
better for this because they have a

00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,080
limited range and that is what a lot of

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:24,360
users we have deal with actually

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:27,540
problems with devices especially if they

00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,370
live in old houses and also the Wi-Fi is

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:32,370
crappy because of whatever is in the

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:35,190
walls and if you have a mesh topology

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,620
you can probably bypass that but you

00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:40,200
have a high cost also different

00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,240
discovery mechanisms you probably know

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,060
UPnP Bonjour

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,620
those protocols flags that wave and

00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,020
ZigBee and because they implement their

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:53,250
own discovery mechanism they all work

00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:54,780
differently for in for an implementer if

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,660
you wanted to have a common interface

00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:03,810
that can deal with all of this different

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:05,780
protocols and their uniqueness oh it's

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:08,780
horrible

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:12,440
all right I'll have a little demo

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:15,320
prepared so regularly

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:20,920
I travel with lots of tech but this time

00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:26,560
only hand luggage so it's a tiny demo I

00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:29,990
have an an ocean light switch here and I

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:33,260
have this little Arduino fella

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,450
we have an LED attached to it and what I

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:39,170
want to do is I want to press that

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:42,650
switch and have the LED light up or not

00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:45,950
so basically toggle the LED okay let's

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:47,960
see if that works

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,600
all right we're in the term oh I get to

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:59,930
the code in a minute I'll first start up

00:22:50,600 --> 00:23:01,970
this system okay oh great yeah I'll give

00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:05,810
me a second I'll go and mirror the

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:10,790
monitors because that helps so

00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:13,930
everything's blocked in okay displays

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:17,860
Mira Mira Mira

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:23,270
Hamas there you are

00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:27,890
okay yeah I was just in the wrong folder

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:30,920
good so first of all I'm starting a

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:35,210
receiver that connects let me also start

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:37,820
photobooth so that you can't see what

00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:40,850
I'm doing so I'll first add a server

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:45,380
that connects to the Arduino via the

00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:49,070
formatter protocol then I'll have a USB

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:52,550
stick here a short cable let's see if we

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,800
can get it into the camp no we can't you

00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:58,490
must believe me I have a USB stick here

00:23:54,800 --> 00:24:02,290
as background that speaks the innovation

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:08,980
protocol plug it back in

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:08,980
therefore I'm going to start second

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:16,760
system and that is what we'll start with

00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:19,260
so let me bump that a bit so this is

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:24,210
basically the receiving

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:28,020
and for the switch let's do this via

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,420
camera and when I press the button you

00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:33,960
see there's something happening there

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:36,210
are incoming telegrams which basically

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,330
represent what the an ocean protocol

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,340
sends us so of course this is actually

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:44,090
some binary blah blah gibberish that's

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:48,510
coming on but if we convert it to string

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:50,460
it looks like this and in this string

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,030
there's a lot of useful information for

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:56,520
us the most important is the unique

00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:02,820
sender ID so that I can identify this

00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:06,720
device and what we have here which is

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:13,430
for this light switch the raw data that

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:16,680
identifies the button I've pressed so on

00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:23,190
the other side I have the Arduino

00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:25,820
connected and back to the video and if I

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:27,540
now press the button the correct one

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,970
that was the wrong one

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:33,630
that was the correct one you'll see I

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:41,700
can turn off that led pretty simple

00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:44,190
stuff but how does this work okay let's

00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,340
first and Murray to this place that will

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,340
help

00:25:51,299 --> 00:26:01,480
hermos where are you here we go

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:03,640
okay what is the code for it is it's

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,460
pretty easy so no security checks no

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,010
nothing it's just like the basics to get

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,620
this to work first of all what I've done

00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,660
to connect to the other you know it's

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,270
basically the johnny-five library which

00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:19,510
is the default you use for other you

00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:21,700
know connections and no chess these days

00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:24,520
not only Arduino it also supports other

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,290
boards like the raspberry tehsil and one

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,950
of the million MakerBot's that are out

00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,320
there and I'm also creating a simple

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:35,169
HTTP server which just listens to every

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,559
request and toggles the LED on that

00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:41,799
Arduino then so it's just a basic web

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,260
server with a basic implementation of

00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,919
the protocol that in the end allows us

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:50,890
to turn this LED on and off and on the

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:54,520
other side are connect to that USB stick

00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:59,020
via the serial bus using a node module

00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,940
called node and ocean also you see just

00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,510
simply listening to all the stuff that

00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,570
is happening on that serial part and if

00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:10,990
we receive the message from the correct

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:14,890
device because that is unique I device

00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:17,980
idea of that light switch and if that is

00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,200
the button that is described with Frio

00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:25,179
or the button edit subscribe with one Oh

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:29,110
so basically Frio is up here and 100 is

00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:32,740
down here we'll just simply issue get

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:38,890
requests and that will be picked up by a

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:41,169
server and yeah toggle the LED simple

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:43,809
stuff I mean if I go back to the schema

00:27:41,169 --> 00:27:46,570
I have here it should be as easy as

00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:49,360
pressing the button and the LED lights

00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:51,790
up of course you can just exchange LED

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,730
with any type of light bub or whatever

00:27:51,790 --> 00:28:00,580
that speaks some protocol you want but

00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:04,630
actually it looks like this I have four

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:07,840
computers involved in this operation

00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:09,910
well I have even six if you would count

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,890
that the light switch as a computer -

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:16,120
because it has some processor and etc in

00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:18,640
it but what I need to do is I have a

00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,370
protocol specific Hardware piece that

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:26,380
USB stick that basically receives the

00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:29,530
commands from the button press have some

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:32,050
piece of software running on whatever

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:37,180
machine mostly nowadays its arm bolts or

00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:39,610
whatever that unifies this in my case it

00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:42,910
was just a simple HD bit HTTP GET

00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:45,610
command into a protocol that some other

00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:49,620
computer could be an intranet could be

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:53,230
in the internet wherever understands

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:56,200
that actually needs to translate this

00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,970
into the protocol that my device I'm

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,420
actually wanting to turn on and off

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:04,540
needs to understand so I'd say we have

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,730
four to six computers here involved in

00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,390
this simple our press a button and a

00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:11,890
light turns up and of course if you have

00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:14,970
different devices with different

00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:18,880
protocols you have to repeat this for

00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:22,830
every protocol you implement and as

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,830
you've seen there are lots of protocols

00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:29,500
also that this demo this wasn't smart I

00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:31,810
use when I say smart home I don't think

00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,140
about pressing a button and a light goes

00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,980
on

00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:38,530
it's not even automated it's manual

00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:40,360
interaction basically we reinvented a

00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:43,030
very complicated light switch

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,010
there was like with four computers and

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,900
lots of software in between and also

00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:50,110
lots of potential points of failure I

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,480
know that because I have replaced every

00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:59,770
light switch in every bulb in my home

00:29:52,480 --> 00:30:03,550
with something smart yeah ok so this is

00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:06,460
what I call the manual home not very far

00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:08,440
from where we're living today but what

00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,560
would you what we actually want is to

00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,540
automate stuff so I mean like we sure

00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,110
need the light switches but when I buy a

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,890
500 euro system I'll expect more of it

00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,860
than be

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,360
than being a glorified light switch I

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:27,940
expect something like this scenario

00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:30,540
where I can have a geofencing so radios

00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:33,820
around my home and if I leave that

00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:36,490
basically the light turns off when I

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,440
leave it don't demo that right now

00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,049
because I don't want to run just run

00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,500
around the block just to see LED

00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:48,460
lighting up or while turning off so no

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:51,760
demo here but in order to enable this

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:54,010
kind of automation we need another piece

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,590
of software that takes care of this I

00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:59,710
mean not only that we need another piece

00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:05,200
of hardware like a phone or something

00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:09,280
that can that knows our position and can

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,730
transmit it we need more we need

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:16,540
something that we call a rule engine and

00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:18,610
a rule engine is basically yeah like you

00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,530
know probably notice from other parts of

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,790
software development it's basically

00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:25,150
something where you can have rule

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:29,500
templates that have triggers and execute

00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:31,480
actions based on it so I have a demo

00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,150
here from a root configuration of the

00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:38,620
Eclipse smart home system that's an open

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:42,299
source system based on Java our product

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:47,710
is based on it too so we're actually the

00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:50,740
the most prolific contributors to the

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,679
Eclipse IDE home system and okay so what

00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,960
we have here we have a simple thing like

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:58,929
I want to turn off the lights when I

00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:00,850
leave so what do I need to do I have a

00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,100
geofence trigger that is basically a

00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,770
binary type trigger because it was just

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:10,360
leave or home 1 or 0 true or false

00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:12,100
I'm at home or not and if I'm away if

00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,929
the binary condition the at home

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,950
condition that is defined in that

00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:21,340
abstract whatever input of the geofence

00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:23,500
trigger if that says I'm away I'm going

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,660
to call an action which is the turn of

00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,970
our lights action which is of course a

00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:30,250
bad reaction to so this is basically the

00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,090
most simple template that I could

00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,220
construct

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:38,490
with the Eclipse smart home rule

00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:41,650
template system that enables me to turn

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,780
lights off when some other actions in

00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,840
this case I'm leaving the the the

00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:51,250
geofence

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,570
triggers and if you see this and this is

00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:54,070
I mean like this is the basic template

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,540
if you're still missing like the real

00:32:54,070 --> 00:33:00,400
implementation we're also missing

00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:02,170
concrete action template parents

00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,450
condition template parents and whatever

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:07,870
template patterns here which are piling

00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:10,000
up on this if you see this and this is

00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:12,190
not even complicated because we could

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,260
also add something like I'm not alone at

00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,190
home there are actually two devices or

00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:20,500
free basically I will have a reverse

00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,260
scenario when I get back home will have

00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:26,530
the lights turn on but I will have the

00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:29,380
lights turn on it turned on based on the

00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:31,150
current light situation so and I mean

00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,560
like doesn't make sense to turn of all

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,230
the lights in the house if there's

00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,880
bright sunlight out there that is not

00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:41,050
even included in this template so this

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,220
is a lot of pros I'd say for a very

00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:47,110
simple task and if you see this you

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,890
probably know why it leads to something

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:51,370
like this

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:55,990
a highly technical representation of the

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:58,060
view of things and this doesn't hide the

00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:01,540
technical complexity it more has

00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,910
embraces it and here we are again the

00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,770
average user is scared of that technical

00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:10,030
complexity is scarce time away from the

00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:12,280
systems and at the moment we need to

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,380
manage very well which features we ship

00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,930
to them and which features we present to

00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:20,680
them because we could do so much more

00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:26,350
but most of a user base is not willing

00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:30,040
to deal with that complexity so to not

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:32,860
repeat the mistake of climbing up a

00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:37,080
ladder to cross the street like Seattle

00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:40,240
did we need to go new ways and

00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:43,419
incrementally improve our systems one

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,810
thing one possible simplification

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:48,280
could be chatbots especially I don't

00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,890
know if you've looked at the average

00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:52,899
teenager these days they're basically

00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:55,000
living in whatsapp or whatever their

00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:58,060
message is called that is actually the

00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:02,260
hip one right now but what they're doing

00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:04,090
is they want to communicate also with

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:07,570
technology using a natural language

00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:10,150
which is also true for not only

00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:13,840
teenagers but also for the average user

00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:17,230
so what we found out was people want to

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:19,330
use when they're in their homes not some

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,130
weird technical terms to describe things

00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:24,130
they want to use the natural language as

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:27,520
they were talking to another person to

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:29,770
steer those things so natural language

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,230
is t'keyah I mean systems like Google

00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:36,970
home assistant or Alexa have proven this

00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:39,520
even on a very low level that if you

00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,460
simplify and naturalize the interaction

00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,160
with technology it will be adapted so

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,620
chat but chat BOTS could be one thing to

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,960
do this I don't care what the input

00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:52,090
system in the end is natural language is

00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,430
the key at least is that is what we

00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:58,690
found out during the past years of

00:35:54,430 --> 00:36:00,520
research so now we're getting closer to

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,470
an actual smart home before that we had

00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,720
manual home we had automated home but

00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:06,640
nothing I would describe as a smart home

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,860
because there was no smartness there was

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,340
those were all pretty dump systems that

00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:14,560
just did whatever we told them and maybe

00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,720
just with some bad rules to tell them

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,660
when to do things but we needed to

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:25,690
explicitly tell them what we wanted them

00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:27,670
to do and what I think is what we need

00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:31,510
and what we're all aiming this and

00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:35,980
aiming at in the sector are empathic

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:37,720
systems that react on the user so people

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,730
will call this artificial intelligence

00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,520
I'd actually like the term from

00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:47,320
Microsoft cognitive services way more

00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:49,900
and also Microsoft has some great

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,940
services with super api's again I'm not

00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:54,910
working for Microsoft I'll just love

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:56,680
what they have in this space open API is

00:36:54,910 --> 00:37:00,190
to test and try out

00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:03,520
like for example this one language a

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:06,039
natural language interpreter system so a

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:10,359
system that basically can understand the

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:12,369
meaning of sentences or complete texts

00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:15,460
given to them this is pretty easy so

00:37:12,369 --> 00:37:17,770
switch all lights to green if you were

00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,510
like your developer if you if you were

00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:22,720
like to code that down you basically

00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:26,680
could just search in a text for lights

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,020
green on/off etc but it can get more

00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:31,569
complex and you need a highly

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:35,740
sophisticated system to interpret texts

00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:38,500
and this is it's basically pretty cool

00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:41,740
thing where it just strips out all the

00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:43,630
key words for you and I'm using this and

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,420
a lot of prototypes I'm building at work

00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:48,940
I mean as long as Deutsche Telekom

00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:54,250
hasn't opened their AI services of

00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:57,930
course I will use them then but what I

00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:00,640
wanted to say is that actually makes the

00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:03,069
hardware in a smart home space a joy to

00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:06,279
interact with because I can just simply

00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:08,250
say turn off the lights or even if we

00:38:06,279 --> 00:38:12,730
have gesture tracking or whatever even

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:14,559
in a more human way like I'm just in the

00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:17,890
room and I can say turn that light off

00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:19,809
like when I when I would like when I the

00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,089
same as when I was like talking to a

00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:24,700
regular person in front of me I would

00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:27,760
never say could you please turn off the

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:29,829
light over at the sofa or turn it to

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,859
green or whatever I basically said

00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:35,319
something I can't turn off that light

00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:36,940
not that I'm that commanding at home

00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:39,099
that I'll send my girlfriend over and

00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,710
say yeah turn of the lights I mean we

00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:44,859
have smart smart systems we can do it

00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:47,109
with our phones when it works but yeah I

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:50,880
think yeah you're getting what I'm

00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:53,940
aiming at so for my next example I

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,619
basically looked for something that

00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,740
separates a computer more than

00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:05,770
everything from a human being and I

00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:08,589
think that our emotions so understanding

00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,570
emotions for a machine is pretty complex

00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:13,030
I'd say and I will have a

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,660
simplified example how we can make this

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,380
possible

00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:20,280
basically the example is or the question

00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:24,190
is how can we make a computer understand

00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,350
our emotions so that we for example

00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:28,240
could embrace them yeah if you're

00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,910
feeling good if you want to keep up that

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,400
mood if you're feeling bad research have

00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:37,090
shown if you present people who are

00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,520
feeling bad feeling down moody if you

00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:42,700
present them with a special color

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,980
temperature or a different type of music

00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,960
and stuff like that their mood actually

00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,690
lightens up they start to feel better

00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,720
and if we want to have a smart system

00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:56,500
that can understand us and our emotional

00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:03,750
an emotional situation we're in we could

00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:03,750
actually help people feel better so

00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:11,350
those things are tailored specifically

00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:17,800
to me like I I was looking for key

00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:24,130
points that determine my mood and those

00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:27,580
are them account 2 for 6 points I come

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:30,250
up with I know for 5 points and the

00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:32,350
emotion that results so if I have less

00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,900
than 4 hours sleep I'm probably feeling

00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,730
bad so there's less and more less or

00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:40,000
more than six eight hours sleep I'm

00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:43,060
feeling good if my weight goes up for a

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,790
certain amount alphabet if it goes down

00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:49,330
for a certain amount of her good and

00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:52,210
also I live in Cologne but 3 days week

00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:54,490
work in Darmstadt so basically I'm

00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:59,740
feeling better when I'm at home and not

00:40:54,490 --> 00:41:01,660
at work and I'm sad and also if I smoke

00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:05,260
more than four cigarettes before noon

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,140
it's basically an indicator for me being

00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:12,580
a grumpy person if it's less than 2 well

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:16,420
then mostly I'm happy so I've collected

00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:20,470
that problems under problems that points

00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:23,830
I identified over 30 days for every day

00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:23,980
and I've added a happiness or sadness in

00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,940
the

00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:33,220
cater to it Oh actually that slide will

00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:34,930
go back to that I gathered the data by

00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,020
asking myself every day in the evening

00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:44,380
how was it there how did you feel and I

00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:46,600
was a good okay is or bad and then I've

00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:51,000
had the data points I've collected over

00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:56,530
the day and like the final mood that was

00:41:51,000 --> 00:42:01,060
that resulted out of it so you might

00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,590
wonder how did I recognize my video the

00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,840
thing that I described is video

00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:08,590
happiness again with cognitive services

00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:10,720
I have a camera at my desk at home and

00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:13,810
that cameras actually there you see

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,760
that's the tree for cats I have in the

00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:18,700
office is actually there to observe the

00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:20,800
cats when I'm away but it actually

00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:23,080
served the purpose of taking a picture

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,609
in the morning of me so this is me

00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:32,290
trying to look happy and it actually was

00:42:26,609 --> 00:42:34,990
by the cognitive services marked as

00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:37,900
happy so I didn't fail at looking happy

00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:40,300
for this demo and you see there are

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:44,950
other points we can have like Santa's or

00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:48,130
surprise disgust anger that is basically

00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:50,200
me trying to look sad that didn't work

00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:57,100
out it seems like the system say it's

00:42:50,200 --> 00:43:00,880
very neutral maybe a bit disgusted I'll

00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:03,010
just I think I just look weird but yeah

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,350
it's okay it's my neutral face it's not

00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:10,330
my sad face then and oh you've got all

00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:12,310
the data I used I used some note module

00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:14,770
called fuzzy forest which is not very

00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:18,520
sophisticated but pretty cool if you

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:21,490
have a few data points and result to

00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:26,220
shuffle all that data points and to

00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:28,990
extract another key point out of it so

00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,240
that's a pretty basic example to predict

00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:35,109
my emotion and to send it to some other

00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:36,880
endpoint how did I actually I want I

00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:37,630
wanted to have this automated and smart

00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,610
not

00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:43,000
giving like manual interactions with it

00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:45,310
so what I did was like getting the data

00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:49,180
from my job on activity tracker about

00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:51,340
how much I slept this night the weight

00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,820
goes from I connected with thing scale

00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:56,440
that I have at home that transmits

00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:59,560
changes from a weight of course the

00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:02,470
location from G you position the video

00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:06,580
happiness I used a simple dealing Wi-Fi

00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:08,950
camera on my desk for this and dealing

00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,630
outdoor camera to track actually how

00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,700
much I was smoking before noon because

00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,220
the outer camera is mounted at a balcony

00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,950
I go out for a smoke at the balcony and

00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:20,830
I use image recognition techniques so if

00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:23,140
there is a change if there's a person

00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,940
actually detected on a balcony it takes

00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:27,010
some pictures sends them to cognitive

00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,290
services and looks for key words like

00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:32,080
smoking cigarettes etc that are

00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:34,570
extracted out of these pictures so I've

00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:36,820
basically automated everything that I

00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:38,890
only had in the end to put up my mood

00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:42,910
there and then after I gathered those

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:46,660
data points that I finally have a result

00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:51,450
to work with so I have a demo for this

00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:56,500
let's do this real quick let's do the

00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:59,680
this simple way which is basically

00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:06,070
executing the script you've seen before

00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:11,140
and terminal here we go no that's what I

00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:14,440
wanted to do and this is basically just

00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:16,510
a script that iterates over all the data

00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,780
points in the CSV file I've shown you

00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:26,670
and in the end let's bump this up a bit

00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:26,670
in the end predicts my emotions based on

00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,850
the current factors I collected for day

00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:37,150
those are stored in a variable test here

00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:39,880
and of course if you see I've slept more

00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:41,980
than eight hours my weight got down away

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,320
not at home so at home I feel mostly

00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:47,890
comfortable but I'm in Berlin so I'm

00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:50,440
away and video happiness is MIT so I'm a

00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:51,369
very neutral video happiness person

00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,259
today and

00:45:51,369 --> 00:45:56,140
cigarettes before noon seem to be less

00:45:53,259 --> 00:45:57,940
so not that much so in the end our

00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:59,769
predicted from that key factor key

00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,529
factors that I'm very happy today

00:45:59,769 --> 00:46:04,749
which I kind of are cuz I'm standing in

00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:10,049
front of you

00:46:04,749 --> 00:46:12,849
okay so we'll have to hurry a bit with

00:46:10,049 --> 00:46:17,079
smart computations like this I think a

00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:20,109
native language interpretation more or

00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:24,460
less invasive concepts or less invasive

00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:25,990
concepts we can actually well bring that

00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:27,670
smart home to the next level this is

00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:30,460
what we're working on which is not out

00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,740
today or in some parts out today but

00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:36,730
will I think shape the future of the

00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:39,640
smart home space being as less invasive

00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,559
as possible about providing a higher

00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:44,680
outcome being as user-friendly as

00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:49,710
possible enabling actually building hard

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,710
and software that enables our users and

00:46:50,249 --> 00:46:55,390
basically lets us leave that glorified

00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,190
light switch over complicated lights

00:46:55,390 --> 00:46:58,989
would have shown you behind I mean if we

00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:02,559
still need it we still need the light

00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:05,049
switch but maybe we can have we can find

00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:06,900
better ways to know when to turn on the

00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:10,140
lights and to which temperature or which

00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:13,630
color to turn on the lights to actually

00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:16,809
improve our lives beyond the glorified

00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:17,890
light switch if you want to know more

00:47:16,809 --> 00:47:20,410
about this topic I mean there was a

00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:25,390
brief introduction in 45 minutes

00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:29,499
I've written a piece on it in German for

00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:31,720
the IOT magazine the IX developer

00:47:29,499 --> 00:47:33,579
special IOT thingy that came out one and

00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:35,890
a half years ago which covers more of

00:47:33,579 --> 00:47:39,460
the open-source system and the protocols

00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:44,680
I've also done a couple of tasks talks

00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:47,319
about this in the past years if you

00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:50,200
wanna look at the talk I was actually

00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:52,299
wanted to give here today about the D

00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:54,339
protocol thingy and how to implement

00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:57,190
implement protocols and how protocols

00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:59,410
look from the inside out look at the OMA

00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:00,339
yo T from J's camp Romania from last

00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,799
year

00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:05,019
the others are mostly fan talks with

00:48:02,799 --> 00:48:08,109
which are now

00:48:05,019 --> 00:48:12,159
that one is I believe four years old but

00:48:08,109 --> 00:48:15,159
it was me tinkering with gesture

00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,649
recognition and stuff like that so I'll

00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:20,559
encourage you to have a look if you're

00:48:17,649 --> 00:48:22,569
interested in a topic also usual slide

00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,959
we are Dodge telecom and especially in

00:48:22,569 --> 00:48:28,509
my team we're hiring we're currently

00:48:25,959 --> 00:48:30,819
evaluating building our next smart home

00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:32,769
app using react native and as you are in

00:48:30,819 --> 00:48:35,109
the JavaScript track this might be of

00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:37,409
interest for you so I'll be here around

00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:40,569
all day if you have questions or

00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:43,299
questions about this yeah just come over

00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:46,149
please and you will have sources and

00:48:43,299 --> 00:48:49,059
links slides will be published so you'll

00:48:46,149 --> 00:48:52,329
have everything ready and one last thing

00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:53,799
before we enters up if you're going to

00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,049
implement software if you're going to

00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:59,919
implement software that works in front

00:48:56,049 --> 00:49:03,159
of users systems and hardware that works

00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:05,499
in front of users just one thing please

00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:10,079
don't be stupid don't be like Seattle

00:49:05,499 --> 00:49:10,079
dude right thank you

00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:15,229
