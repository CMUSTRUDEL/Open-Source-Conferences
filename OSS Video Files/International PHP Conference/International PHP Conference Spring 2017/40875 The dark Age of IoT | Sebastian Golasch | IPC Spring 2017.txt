Description: 
	Sebastian Golasch (Deutsche Telekom): Advertisements suggest that we are zenith of mankind’s scientific knowledge and technological power, but when it comes to IoT and the so called “Smart Home”, we are clearly not. In fact, we are in the middle of the dark age. In this talk, I will go deep in to the rabbit hole of todays “Smart Home” protocols, explain why device interoperability is a myth and tell you why the open source community is our only hope of having an secure and literally smart “Smart Home“ experience.
