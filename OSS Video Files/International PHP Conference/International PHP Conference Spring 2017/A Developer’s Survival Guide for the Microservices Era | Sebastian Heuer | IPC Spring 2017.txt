Description: 
	Sebastian Heuer (die kartenmacherei GmbH): Microservices architectures have emerged from a sophisticated concept to a broadly adopted pattern during the past years, so it is safe to say that they will stick around at least for the next couple of years.
But as we all know, no solution fits every problem. Based on real-world examples we will have a look at best practices and the pitfalls you can easily run into as well as at the implications Microservices can and should have on development teams, so you can decide for yourself if they are suitable for your projects.
