Description: 
	PHP 7 is an imperative programming language that supports procedural as well as object-oriented programming. It has limited support for functional programming and language extensions for aspect-oriented programming exist. PHP 7 is dynamically, implicitly, and weakly typed but supports explicit typing and strict type checking when desired. But what does this all mean? Join Sebastian Bergmann at International PHP Conference 2016 on a whirlwind tour through the interesting land of programming language design principles and find out just what a great language PHP is.

The International PHP Conference is the worldâ€™s first PHP conference and stands since more than a decade for top-notch pragmatic expertise in PHP and web technologies. Internationally renowned experts from the PHP industry meet up with PHP users and developers from large and small companies.
