Title: Touch Events: Interview mit Patrick H. Lauke (The Paciello Group)
Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2013
Description: 
	Mobile Browser sind darauf ausgerichtet, Webseiten so gut wie möglich auf Handys und Tablets darzustellen und via Touch bedienbar zu machen. Dazu simulieren sie die meisten bekannten Maus-Events. Aber diese Event-Emulation im Browser hat auch Nachteile. Mit PHP-Magazin-Redakteurin Corinna Kern hat Accessibility Consultant Patrick H. Lauke von The Pacielle Group über eine echte Alternative dazu gesprochen: Touch Events.

and only had to become of the veteran

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:15,210
Alex 5,000 hides in my name is cooking I

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:17,789
can deduct children by PAP magazine by

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,650
magazine de I'm going to switch to

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,900
English now since my interview partner

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,000
today's Patrick Clarke accessibility

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,660
consultant at the pasilla crew hi

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,449
Patrick let's talk about getting touchy

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:34,680
if I have a web site and want to make

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:38,640
sure that it works on touch devices what

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,070
should I do well the the short answer is

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,800
if your website is not doing anything

00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,270
special if it's just a simple website

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,300
maybe you have a little bit of

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,370
JavaScript to do certain effects on the

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,070
page certain buttons activate something

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,350
you actually don't have to do almost

00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,960
anything or sometimes in the best case

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,660
nothing at all because browsers on

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,760
mobile devices or tablets the

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,489
traditional browsers their own touch

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,130
devices are actually built to use the

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,020
web as it is today and because the web

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,750
of today is still filled with a lot of

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,020
these types of websites that use even

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:19,200
bad practices like scripts that fire on

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,180
onmouseover for instance because the web

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,119
has a lot of that content these browsers

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,790
actually emulate these because I

00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,770
specific Mouse events so in the best

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,409
case you don't have to do anything at

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,630
all but there might be other problems

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,159
there might be certain situations where

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,070
you want to do something very

00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,460
interactive or there might be situations

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,829
like having drop-down menus that only

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,780
happen on hover that sort of interaction

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,320
isn't well supported on touch devices

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,600
and at that point yes there are a new

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,570
class of events that you'd want to use

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,119
called touch events which were invented

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,909
by apple introduced with the iOS safari

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,189
now all the other browsers with one

00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,560
exception have adopted them as well so

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,170
you get them in firefox on android for

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,660
instance or you know chrome on a

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,470
touch-enabled laptop the one exception

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,440
is microsoft with ie 10

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:19,320
have introduced a whole new class of

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,560
events called pointer events which kind

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,810
of merged the two concepts together of

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,810
is it a mouse as a touch they they

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,340
basically build a framework around this

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,470
particular idea because I was a

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,870
developer I don't necessarily need to

00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,970
know if the user used the finger or a

00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,520
mouse all I want to know is there was a

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,940
certain kind of interaction but once you

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,320
start using those events you can really

00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,750
take advantage of the various

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,570
interactivity is that the touch events

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,230
oh sorry the touchscreens offer things

00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:55,230
like swiping things like multi-touch

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:58,110
extensions etc mm-hmm could you give us

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,880
a short practical example on how to use

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:04,880
touch events in in what use case oh one

00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,400
of the one of the classic examples

00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:10,560
really is that if you don't do anything

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,860
at all and just rely on the browser's

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,500
firing the simulated Mouse events you'll

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,600
notice that if your scripts for instance

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,750
are listening on the click handler of

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,780
say a button to fire a certain type of

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,630
interaction you'll notice that on a top

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,940
screen device as you're releasing the

00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,239
finger from the touch device there is a

00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,330
delay of about 300 350 milliseconds

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,390
before the event is actually being fired

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:42,180
now that's because these touch devices

00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,920
the finger itself the finger-touch is

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,170
actually overloaded it doesn't just

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,630
serve one purpose it's not just there to

00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:51,180
say I want to activate something but

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,970
users use the finger as well a simple

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,370
tap to maybe start a double tap on a

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,810
device or there might be a second finger

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,410
that comes on the screen to start a

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,720
gesture or to do scrolling etc so the

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,150
browser's on these touch devices are

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,430
really they're waiting to see is

00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,860
something more happening or was this an

00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,920
actual touch an actual kind of

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,989
activation event if you will after that

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,729
300 millisecond delay they're fairly

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,979
sure that nothing else is going to

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:23,400
happen and they fire the the click event

00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:26,250
them on a regular website 300

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,240
milliseconds are noticeable but most

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,819
users are

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,949
never heard anybody complain about that

00:04:29,819 --> 00:04:34,470
kind of thing but as we're trying to now

00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:37,530
start to build more kind of native

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,690
application like web applications that

00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,050
mimic some of the interactions that you

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,259
get on native apps that delay becomes

00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,180
quite noticeable and it does feel a very

00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:50,699
sluggish you're pressing a button and

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,039
that 300 milliseconds really kind of

00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:55,550
makes you wonder why is this application

00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,740
running so slow so there are techniques

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:01,620
that involve touch events that allow you

00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,650
to overcome that 300 millisecond delay

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:07,319
one of the classic approaches that I've

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,240
seen far too many times and it's

00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:12,419
unfortunate because it's a it's slightly

00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,639
problematic is to do a feature detect at

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,940
the star to say does the browser support

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,009
touch and if so instead of listening to

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,830
the click event instead of hooking my

00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:25,740
scripts into click I can fire them right

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:28,919
away on touch start or touch end for

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:31,050
instance now that approach works in most

00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,300
cases and it's it's kind of a tried and

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,880
tested approach for the last few years

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,650
however it makes an assumption that the

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,229
browser that supports touch is on a

00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,740
device that is exclusively a touch

00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:46,020
device that held true on what when the

00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,900
landscape only included iPhones and

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,180
Android phones and tablets but there's

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:54,840
now a whole new class of devices on the

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,789
market windows 8 laptops are you know

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,819
there's hundreds of different models

00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:02,310
even on the the lower end of the of the

00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:04,500
scale the very cheap ones already come

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,330
now with touchscreens I mean that's one

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,699
of the big features of Windows 8 is the

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:10,650
the whole interactivity you can use a

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:13,349
top screen you can use the keyboard you

00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,719
can use the mouse or trackpad and really

00:06:13,349 --> 00:06:18,289
what we're seeing now is users actually

00:06:15,719 --> 00:06:21,630
switching between different input modes

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:23,909
even while there you know filling out a

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:26,610
form on a website for instance or just

00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:29,460
following through a single action during

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,960
a single visit on on a website so making

00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,479
the assumption that if it's a touch

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,389
device users will only use touch and

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,460
therefore I will only listen to touch is

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:41,009
a problem because by doing that you

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,319
automatically cut out users

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,900
yes are on a device that's capable of

00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,599
touch but are actually using a mouse or

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,789
a trackpad or even a keyboard and there

00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,210
are other devices more kind of hybrid

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:56,219
devices like android based laptops for

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,529
instance which run Android have a

00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:01,139
keyboard and a mouse and obviously the

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:03,659
touch interface as well so it's just

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,270
about being careful not making

00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:09,389
assumptions about it's either touch or

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,330
the traditional events but in an ideal

00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:15,240
case doubling up events and listening to

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:17,370
all types of inputs that the users might

00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,050
be sending to your application well

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,210
thank you patrick i think you gave us

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:23,550
quite some impression on how to get

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:28,370
touchy with our websites and we say

00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,370
