Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2013
Description: 
	jQuery Mobile is a cross-platform framework made for smartphones and tablets. With its HTML5 interface, it looks and feels like an app. This presentation will teach you how to quickly create a mobile front-end with little effort. It will also feature a use-case of adapting an existing web application to the mobile.

welcome everyone this talk is going to

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,710
be about jQuery Mobile and it's suited

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,660
for all levels there's not going to be

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,449
much cold so if you're not a JavaScript

00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,160
guru that is going to be fine for you so

00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:25,050
but who here has experience with

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:30,119
JavaScript create all right and who owns

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:36,930
an Android okay iphone some people raise

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:39,510
their hands twice windows phone not even

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:45,059
one okay you should usually I get at

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:47,940
least one and a blackberry alright cool

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:51,239
so the purpose of this presentation is

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,300
to help you pick between mobile sites

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,789
and a mobile app so i will explain why

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,460
it's appropriate in many cases to create

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,980
a mobile site and i will show you how

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,170
easy it is to create one using jquery

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,090
mobile there's a space in front if you

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:11,790
want this is based right over there yeah

00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,500
and so about myself i generate return

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,720
investment through advice so whether

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,000
it's in a technical level or more in a

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,220
management level I sometimes write code

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,200
you can pick up a business card at the

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:28,200
end I also have some unit test advice on

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,729
a little cartons in yes you can ask

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,920
questions anytime so feel free to

00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,240
interrupt us will answer any questions

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,159
last thing I have an article coming up

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,140
in PHP architect magazine in North

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,030
America so you can get the twenty

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,460
percent off on a new subscription with

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,049
this special code so you can write it

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,960
down or I can give it to you afterwards

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,049
if you're interested so why would you

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,790
choose a mobile site because it is quick

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:58,920
it is inexpensive when you create a

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,649
website sorry when you create a mobile

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,689
application you have to consider all the

00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:05,399
current devices but also any future

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,940
devices and maintenance for those

00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,250
applications with a website you don't

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,370
really need to consider all of that it

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,680
can be much easier the website is a

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,810
point of entry for first time users so

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,180
when they search for you online they

00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,190
will first come into a website and you

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,890
may not want to turn them off by asking

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,959
them to download and mobile application

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,120
instead because when you download it

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,690
takes time to download it takes time to

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,700
install once you install it it uses up

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,220
valuable icon space because you already

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,080
have plenty of icons and after you

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,390
finish using it if it's just for one

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,269
time you will then uninstall it so it's

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,840
a lot of manipulations for just checking

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:51,620
up some content quickly so with the

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,959
mobile side there's no download just

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,120
load the website which is much quicker

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,010
and others may link to your website so

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,739
for example if you have some content

00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,269
people share it on Twitter people click

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,569
the link they want to be able to get to

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,390
your website so this is an entry point

00:03:05,569 --> 00:03:11,610
and you don't necessarily need speed and

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,950
all the native feature features all the

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,730
browsers do support some native features

00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:19,650
like cameras and GPS already supported

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:22,200
soon we might have gyroscope so you may

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,659
even create html5 games where you can

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,549
tilt your phone I don't know if it's

00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,700
supported recent on some more recent

00:03:26,549 --> 00:03:33,180
devices but the question once you decide

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,269
to create a website the question is is

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,790
it going to work on this device do you

00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:41,970
think do you think your website can work

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:46,530
on that there are many challenges for

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:49,049
example well development takes time like

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,629
with everything the UI when you create

00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,640
just a when you take a basic website the

00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,110
UI is not suited for mobile because you

00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,239
have small links that you need to click

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,909
sometimes they're really stacked close

00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:03,360
together so you really need Hakka hook

00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:05,970
out right Hawk eyes aim in order to

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,500
click on that on that link we have to

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,930
pinch zoom and then select the

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,720
appropriate link you can have text

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,060
overflow so even if you turn something

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,530
in portrait mode you can still have some

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,859
text overflows you need to scroll

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:22,049
horizontally that's not a challenge and

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,660
when you scroll you can sometimes result

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:27,120
in a click and that happened to me on a

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,580
website recently where I was scroll

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,580
ling vertically the website was fitting

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,350
perfectly within my mobile device but I

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,330
was scrolling and then there was a an

00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:38,850
interactive map which took the entire

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,889
screen and then I was stuck in that area

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,720
because I was just dragging the map

00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:44,760
around so you have to consider all of

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,949
that when you design for the mobile and

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,300
there are so many variables there's

00:04:46,949 --> 00:04:52,560
different devices there's different

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:54,360
browsers there's many capabilities some

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,720
of the capabilities is obviously the

00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,430
viewport size you have very limited

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,639
screen real estate on the in your screen

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:04,650
you have different pointing methods the

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,479
most common that we know is the

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,660
touchscreen but there's also joysticks

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,260
there is a stylist there is a click

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:16,860
wheel like on the older blackberries you

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:19,020
may or may not have image support most

00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,850
devices now do have but users may be

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,220
able to turn them off in order to save

00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:25,979
some bandwidth or just in order to load

00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,620
their websites much more faster if they

00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:32,639
are using a 3g in a remote area for

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:34,710
example there's also the number of

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,360
colors we've seen that on the Kindle you

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,780
basically just have two colors black and

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,320
white you have to consider that there is

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,910
a possibility of HTTPS support utf-8 or

00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,870
here in Germany you know that better

00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:51,840
because you use more than the standard

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,630
standard ASCII characters like they do

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,910
in the US and percent with so when you

00:05:54,630 --> 00:06:00,199
try to resize your website to fit the

00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:03,240
entire screen some of them only can use

00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:06,570
pixel-based widths so you cannot

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:11,280
automatically fit your your website

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,080
design there's many more and you may not

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,139
be aware of all the capabilities and

00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,970
that's why designing websites for the

00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,970
mobile back in the days was so difficult

00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:26,760
so the solution is to use jQuery Mobile

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,560
it's a JavaScript framework so the

00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,599
framework if you're unfamiliar it's just

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,050
a tool that makes it easier to create

00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:35,849
complex functionality and with jQuery

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,650
Mobile you only have one code base so

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,810
you don't have to replicate your website

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:40,800
for different devices you only create

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,379
one code base

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,139
and it's just going to work on all

00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,909
devices your website is going to look

00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:51,030
the same everywhere you can still

00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:53,729
customize through CSS to say that for

00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:56,699
this device I want to have that look and

00:06:53,729 --> 00:07:01,770
feel so that you can sort of adapt it to

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:04,289
look more native for that device the UI

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:08,460
by itself is adapted to the mobile so

00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:11,190
have big clickable areas it also has

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,759
many tricks to help you save screen real

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,250
estate and it works on many devices the

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,759
devices in which it can work is Android

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,430
Blackberry windows phone iPhone iPad all

00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:25,169
the different tablets kindle and many

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,800
more they keep adding supports all the

00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:30,830
time and the way does that is through a

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,050
process called progressive enhancement

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:36,150
so it's going to look great on the

00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:39,050
latest device and browser it's going to

00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,669
be it's going to look its full potential

00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:44,039
but it will still be presentable on

00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:47,430
older ones so basically starts with a

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:50,759
baby base and then it enhances with each

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,560
new available feature or capability that

00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,930
it finds on the device so if the device

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,599
supports images it's going to add images

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:02,210
and and so forth if it has Ajax then

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,210
it's going to add nice slick transitions

00:08:02,659 --> 00:08:07,289
if you're wondering about the the

00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:10,409
features that it supports it has many

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:12,840
mobile specific events something that

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:16,080
otherwise you will have to write by hand

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,120
you can have tap which is a quick tap is

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,699
basically like a click and you can have

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,690
a longer top which is about one second

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:27,599
of pressing something and that will be a

00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:29,940
hold tab you can swipe left or right

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,310
vertical swiping is it's really just

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,190
scrolling but you can swipe sideways in

00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:38,010
order to flip pages in an article for

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,159
example or if you have multiple columns

00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:45,510
say the schedule you will have different

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,029
days so you can scroll a swipe to the

00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:50,160
left or to the right to change columns

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,440
it responds to orientation changes and

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,660
also has all the usual events like click

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,660
drag and drop so you can also

00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,660
use that and it has transitions it has

00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,670
forms and caching history control and

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,199
you will see that a little later alright

00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,970
so that's enough for the theory let's

00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:07,980
build something let's look at some code

00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,139
first thing you need to do is include

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,779
some JavaScript files javascript and CSS

00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:16,410
sorry you need three files the first is

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:18,269
the basic jQuery framework then you need

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,670
the second framework which is the jQuery

00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:24,870
Mobile framework and then you add the

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:27,019
CSS which is the jQuery Mobile CSS then

00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,759
there are some images that come with it

00:09:27,019 --> 00:09:33,120
and then if you want to create a button

00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:36,779
all you do is you use an anchor tag with

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,089
a data roll off button and you just add

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,740
a text inside that the roll is something

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,860
that's part of the html5 specification

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,680
by the way it has no meaning to the

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:50,579
browser everything is prefixed with data

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,699
dash something that's that you use in

00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,319
order to enhance functionality using

00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:56,639
frameworks such as this one or you can

00:09:55,319 --> 00:10:00,230
just use it internally it's like

00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:02,850
metadata basically for your HTML and

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,339
this will place the visual elements so

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,339
it will convert links such as these into

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,139
nice buttons and you can customize the

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,680
look and feel later this is the default

00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:15,930
one that comes with jquery mobile and it

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,759
also have also has different swatches so

00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:20,939
different color combinations that you

00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,689
can use she can quickly get started you

00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:25,949
can also use lists lists are simple UL

00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:29,430
can everybody see the code in the back

00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:31,680
it's good all right so use a ul and

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,680
instead of button you call it a list

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,839
view and for every item it will create a

00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:40,380
row today I will show you what it looks

00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,050
like will create a row with a well if

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,269
you make it clickable using a link it

00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:47,100
will create a little arrow and you can

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:50,040
click on the entire block not just the

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,579
arrow so it's very easy on the mobile

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,500
you just click on the entire line that

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,569
will be lying to tell you that you just

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,670
you just use that to roll and it works

00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:02,339
like magic you have to encapsulate it in

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,500
a shell and I will explain why you need

00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:09,330
to use such shells later because it adds

00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:14,560
more possibilities later on

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:17,290
so after you put the javascript files

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,680
and CSS in the head in the body you

00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:23,200
start with a container a diff container

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,090
data paid a troll page and it will tell

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,550
you that everything that goes inside

00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:30,310
this container is part of a single page

00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:32,890
and you can have multiple pages in the

00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,360
same document i will show you later by

00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:36,460
the way complete examples will be in

00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:39,100
github so later i will give you a link

00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:42,700
and you can you can download that and

00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:46,030
mess with it so inside your page you

00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,340
create another container called content

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,770
and the reason this is the central piece

00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:52,540
and the reason why we we nest these is

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:55,690
because within the page you can have

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:58,450
also a header and a footer and they have

00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:01,270
a special look to them so you can add

00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:04,180
like back button in the header you can

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,160
add some other information in the footer

00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:08,380
you can make sure you can also make them

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,300
fix so that when you scroll the footer

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,820
may remain visible in all times and

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,920
that's that's when you put the button so

00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:22,030
it's just two containers and then you go

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,740
ahead and write your content the button

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:29,830
by itself is not going to do anything

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:31,660
until you link to another page so and I

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:33,730
will show you a simple example where you

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,080
can create two pages within the same

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,200
document actually you can create as many

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,750
as you want so within the same document

00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:44,470
you create another data-role page you

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:46,840
give it an a unique ID by default jquery

00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:48,820
will display only the first one it will

00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,400
make it visible and the other ones will

00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,830
be hidden until such time as there is a

00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,510
link that points to them then it will

00:12:53,830 --> 00:13:00,070
play a transition and display the

00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:03,640
correct one all right and to create a

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:06,150
link you just standard the hashtag about

00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:11,850
that points to this I'll show you this

00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:11,850
life if I can

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,890
yeah so there is this is the about

00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:23,860
button and when I click on it it goes to

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:26,410
a page and the page has a header it has

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,890
content and what's interesting is when

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,570
you press this it is equivalent to that

00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,780
ok so the back button on the browser so

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,160
it plays with the history so it's very

00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,990
nice even though you're still in the

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,820
same document it recorded that as a

00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:48,100
separate page and you can just go back

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:51,550
alright so next thing I will show you a

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:55,090
case study of the Auslan website so

00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:57,850
Austin is a conference in the United

00:13:55,090 --> 00:14:00,910
States in the Portland it's an annual

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:03,640
event and they have a website that's not

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,890
really usable on a mobile device and I

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:10,330
will show you how to adapt it to the

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:12,010
mobile so this is the website that was

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:16,570
from the year where I presented there

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:20,190
that was in 2012 and this is a the

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:23,470
visible portion on a mobile phone so

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:25,690
let's not consider the side column let's

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,280
consider the main content you only see

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,230
half but the thing is if you flip your

00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,080
phone you still don't see the entire

00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,610
line so you have to either zoom out and

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,800
or scroll horizontally and the thing is

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,560
notice how the links are very close

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:46,120
together so you have the date you have

00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:48,910
the time you have the tags mobile you

00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:50,800
have my name you have the title so in

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,440
order to click on something specific

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,730
like my name you already zoomed out

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,710
right because you need to be able to

00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,350
read you know and then move the

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:03,130
magnifying glass you have to pinch zoom

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:07,780
again in order to be able to point to my

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:09,700
name so it's really it's really hard to

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,950
use that but it's really easy to adapt

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,420
to a mobile there will be some

00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:18,790
sacrifices of course you have no choice

00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:23,170
this is this is my proposed view for

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:25,699
that same page done entirely using

00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:27,319
jquery mobile

00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:30,559
basically it's a list with some

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:33,470
separators that's all I did and here are

00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,809
the improvements I made there is no

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:39,639
zooming anymore because everything fits

00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:42,040
within the width of your of your page

00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:45,199
there is a search box just below

00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:47,179
schedule and on top of Wednesday you see

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,709
filter items if you click there you can

00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,980
start typing and it's going to

00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:54,019
dynamically filter out the list and you

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,809
only see the relevant elements as you

00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:58,519
type the entire blog becomes clickable

00:15:56,809 --> 00:16:01,549
because I showed you the list before the

00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,859
entire block is clickable then if you

00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:05,899
want to get more information about the

00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:07,609
speaker you're going to have to click

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,579
from there but at least you're not

00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:13,369
there's no competition between the tiny

00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:15,079
little links over there there's less

00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:20,179
information to reduce clutter so I

00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:22,040
removed the tags i removed the dip sorry

00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,629
I removed the actually I didn't remove

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,609
that much just the tags and the

00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:27,889
description the description will be on

00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:32,929
the next page and the separators are

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:34,759
just indicating which which date is so

00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:37,549
once you click you get to a description

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,789
page with a back button to the schedule

00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:45,730
you have my photo you have title name

00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:48,679
company dates time room accordion

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:51,769
components in order to hide some

00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,419
information some more so that this is

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,999
actually a personal choice you can just

00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:58,609
put it sequentially but I put it this

00:16:55,999 --> 00:17:00,889
way because I wanted people to see in

00:16:58,609 --> 00:17:02,809
advance before scrolling all the

00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:04,789
information that will be available on

00:17:02,809 --> 00:17:06,470
this page because if they don't scroll

00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:08,419
all the way down they may not see the

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:10,100
feedback form they won't leave any

00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:13,429
feedback for the speaker and that makes

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:16,490
us sad and you have a footer which is

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:18,620
always visible with all the share

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,389
buttons so as a speaker i also want to

00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,279
announce the news when i get accepted to

00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:24,110
a conference i want to share it on

00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:27,470
facebook twitter i want to email it to

00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:30,230
someone this is also very useful for

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,490
organizers because it allows us to well

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,179
the excitement of the speaker's

00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:36,950
basically promotes the event so the

00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:39,200
approval ins is that once again no

00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:44,450
zooming required the collapsible blocks

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:58,389
share buttons I will go to the next page

00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:58,389
here doesn't work as expected

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:14,830
alright

00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:22,419
so there is as you see you can filter

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:24,880
the items so if I type sorry it's very

00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:31,240
hard to type in and not see what you're

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:33,940
typing jquery yeah there you are so so

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,220
as I filter it dynamically removes all

00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,269
the elements that are not relevant and

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,450
it keeps the separator on top which is

00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:45,610
very very neat because it's it has some

00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:47,710
information it has some meaning so you

00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:50,679
don't want to lose that that complex

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:53,919
when you search it's very simple and

00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:58,600
then I can click on that and I get the

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:00,610
description here I can close it I have

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,169
feedback if I switch the description

00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,929
feedback is going to be collapsed and

00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:08,200
the cool thing is that you have various

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:10,269
components such as forms with all the

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,789
different widgets inside and you can

00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:15,370
submit by going to a new page or you can

00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:18,190
also submit via Ajax engines display a

00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,450
little dialogue that says feedback has

00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:21,450
been received thank you very much

00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,740
and that doesn't require much code so if

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,660
you go download it from github it's

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,110
really only a few lines of code it's

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:40,690
basically you write HTML and you create

00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:43,690
data rules with some other meta data and

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:46,570
the jquery mobile framework takes care

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:48,130
of the rest and i won't show you all the

00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,299
features because there's there's a lot

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,190
of them you can when you check the

00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:54,549
documentation there's interactive

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:57,010
examples for pretty much anything I

00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:59,320
think it's one of the best documentation

00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:01,960
for an open source project that I've

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,700
ever read personally i will show you

00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:07,150
some best practices because very quickly

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:09,700
you will run into trouble with mobile

00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:13,000
for example when you have long lists so

00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:16,030
a lot of presentations a ausgang had I

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,100
don't know at least 150 presentations so

00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:21,210
it can create a very long list so what

00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,640
you can do is splitting them into groups

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,530
for example if you have a few groups

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,540
like by day so you have a three day

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,270
conference you can at least split it

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,540
into three groups and put that just

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:39,549
beneath your header so you put a Tuesday

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:41,770
Wednesday Thursday if you have that's

00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:45,250
that's if you have few categories if you

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,870
want to split in two more groups then

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,820
that won't do because you have limited

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,770
space you can create intermediate lists

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,860
so so that's an interesting trick

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,690
basically create one page with the

00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,549
categories and then when you click on

00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,160
the category in this case say we click

00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:02,740
on business track and you have 15

00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,720
presentations there it will create a it

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,780
will show you another page where you

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:12,330
have all of the business talks 15

00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:15,160
elements only so that can be very useful

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,710
when you have navigation it can quickly

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,870
become complex because you click and

00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:23,230
click and never get to where you want so

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:26,169
useless where wherever appropriate so

00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:29,559
for example if I have multiple multiple

00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:31,960
items I just stack them this way why

00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:34,929
would I use a list for for navigation

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,970
because when items are aligned text is

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,610
aligned to the left on the mobile you

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:42,100
can possibly align it all horizontally

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,250
but if it's all left aligned vertical

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:48,520
it's easy to read because the way our

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:51,700
eye focuses on the first letter so it's

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,559
very easy to find what we want I suggest

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,530
to keep your navigation narrow and

00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:58,270
shallow so what it means is that you

00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:01,539
don't display too many links at once you

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:03,370
don't want 200 links but you also don't

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,110
want the person to click too many times

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:08,350
in order to get to where they want and

00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,720
that's just standard for any website not

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,700
just mobile it's particularly hard on

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,039
the mobile because you have so much so

00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:17,980
so little space I'm sorry and then you

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,710
also have latency because when you click

00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:24,400
go to the next page and you're not

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:29,260
always using Wi-Fi so it can can be very

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:33,370
slow and you also should always describe

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:36,820
your links my associate just last week

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:39,340
found an interesting website where not

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,929
only they like if you just use icons

00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,090
that are meaningless I mean that's a key

00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,490
at some point you can associate an icon

00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:48,429
to an idea so you click through them

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:51,490
once but that was really special the

00:22:48,429 --> 00:22:53,860
website had only numbers as links so

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,450
it's like link one two three it's at one

00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,210
two three and what does that mean I

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,240
don't know if you're on a desktop you

00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:04,210
can roll over and guess from the status

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,710
bar where it's going to lead but if you

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,809
are no mobile you don't have that luxury

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:09,880
so you just have to click on all of them

00:23:07,809 --> 00:23:12,460
and remember k so one that's the

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,250
presentations of that conference to is

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,919
the list of speakers it's really crazy

00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,720
so that's that's extreme but even if you

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,090
use icons they might not mean to your

00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:24,820
users what you think what you want them

00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,549
to mean so a good thing is always

00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:31,419
accompanied them with text you can just

00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:33,549
use text or a combination of the two so

00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:35,380
that people can once they figure out

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:38,230
what everything is they can then

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,610
associate a star to favorites and then

00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:43,480
next time they can find it much more

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:48,909
quickly with their eyes you will run

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:50,380
into performance problems so I suggest

00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:53,559
that you keep your transitions to a

00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:55,840
minimum that's also for usability issues

00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,409
for usability concerns

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,419
but some people have slow devices they

00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:04,120
say latest devices are really fast but

00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:06,250
here I have a one year old phone and it

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:08,110
occasionally lags when there's heavy

00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:12,370
transitions because you know I'm doing

00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:14,409
lots of things in the background so when

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,350
there's a transition during that time if

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:19,690
it takes a lot of many seconds to catch

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,750
up then during that time I might liken

00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:24,400
to nothing and you lose a lot of time

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:26,620
because of that even even if the

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,059
transition goes smoothly I mean it's

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,640
fancy but at some point you're just

00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:32,770
losing precious time because it's all

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,740
flying everywhere and you have to

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:38,740
consider the refresh rate of magnetic

00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:42,490
ink magnetic ink doesn't refresh at the

00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:44,320
60 frames per second it's very slow it's

00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:46,690
it's it's going to be very choppy you

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,120
can try I haven't tried but I would

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:51,100
think that it's very choppy because of

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:56,409
how much time it takes just to turn the

00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:59,169
page and a book there's also download

00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:01,750
speeds now the concept of round trip is

00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:04,750
that there's an overhead when you go to

00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:08,169
the server to download something so here

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:10,990
it's just a proportion of proportion of

00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:13,210
the yellow is the part where you

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:15,490
actually download the time it takes you

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:17,799
to download the content that you are

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:21,520
getting for a two point one kilobyte

00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:23,320
page and the red is the the overhead of

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,110
the round trip so the time to go to the

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:29,559
server and get a response back so this

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,149
is an average mobile device and if you

00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:33,220
have two of those pages then you have

00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:35,470
very little download but a lot of round

00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,500
trips and it's going to take you about

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,809
two seconds I think to get that oil can

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,840
take multiple seconds so what you can do

00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,880
is combine your pages into multi-page

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,710
documents much as I showed you in the

00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,380
beginning where you had the about page

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:53,860
which is in the same documents so just

00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,169
use different containers combine it this

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:59,919
way and when you combine what happens is

00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:02,980
that is the same round trip but it's the

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,530
yellow are combined and it's 3.6 which

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,110
is less than the sum of the other two

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,110
because you also save on the overhead of

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,740
every

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:15,440
that's outside of your body tag so you

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,630
really save heavily on that so there's

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,250
no more redundance you shouldn't overuse

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:22,760
that you can you shouldn't go the other

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,500
extreme and load your entire website for

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,380
example you have a hundred presentations

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:31,940
with all of their descriptions you may

00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:34,760
not want to to load all of that at once

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:37,970
because then you would be waiting for a

00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,350
very long time and eventually you don't

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:42,350
get the information you want or you just

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,940
want to check the say the address of the

00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,710
conference and then you leave the

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:47,660
website and you would have waited all

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:49,370
this time for nothing which is which

00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:54,140
would be similar to downloading an

00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:56,150
application the other thing that you can

00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,700
combine is you can combine images into

00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,080
what is called sprite maps now we'll

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,190
show you visually what it means if

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,190
you're not familiar with the topic

00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:11,210
sprite maps is when you combine multiple

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,880
small images into one image and you use

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:18,230
a little CSS trick in order to create a

00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:23,419
mask or like a window so say you have

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:25,340
all of these icons and with CSS you say

00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:29,049
that you know the background image of

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:31,970
all the icons is going to be the entire

00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:36,049
PNG of icons and it's going to be 18

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:37,940
pixels wide by 18 pixels high and if

00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:40,490
it's a bad button then you will

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,380
basically shift you will reposition the

00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:44,780
background underneath the window you

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:49,220
created and you will only reveal a

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:54,530
portion of the image so that's a neat

00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:57,470
CSS trick jQuery Mobile has 22 icons by

00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:00,440
default and can anyone guess how much

00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:10,030
how many kilobytes it is combined so 18

00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:13,370
x 18 pixels x 22 how many kilobytes 52

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:16,490
1.7 kilobytes so why on earth would you

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:19,640
take a 1.7 kilobytes and split it into

00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,340
22 and waste all of those seconds in

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,860
overhead you know round-trip time

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,049
you can just you can just combine them

00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:29,570
into one and people use that often also

00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:32,029
when they have for all of their design

00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,940
items because it loads much faster and

00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:37,010
also when you have rollover effects they

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,919
are much smoother unless you use some

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,240
javascript tricks to preload images but

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,289
this is this is much simpler because

00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:48,230
it's just pure CSS so it's a nice trick

00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:53,779
you want to look at another thing you

00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:56,570
can do is link your jquery JJ sorry

00:28:53,779 --> 00:28:59,750
javascript and CSS files to the jquery

00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:02,720
site or rather pull them from the jquery

00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:05,720
site directly so instead of storing them

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:08,809
locally you will go to code jquery calm

00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,960
and load them from from here why would

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:15,950
you do that because one is considered

00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,320
this you have a user that goes to some

00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:20,809
other websites and that other website

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,149
uses the jquery mobile framework the

00:29:20,809 --> 00:29:24,890
same version once they go to that

00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:27,200
website the jquery will be cached

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,570
because it's from jQuery com will be

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,640
cached and then when they go to your

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,039
website it's going to try to access the

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,409
exact same resource not your local copy

00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:39,679
but the exact same resource it will be

00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:42,590
already loaded into in the cache and so

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:45,380
you're your own website will as a result

00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:47,570
benefit from that cash and will load

00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:50,929
much faster so the only thing that will

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:57,260
really load is your own images and your

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:59,630
own HTML so you will have to load that

00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:03,289
again some interesting tools that you

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:05,870
can use you have a UI builder to the

00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:09,080
interface change slightly it's much more

00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:12,740
advanced now so you can prototype your

00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:14,960
UI using this tool in the browser so you

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:17,330
just drag your lists and buttons and see

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,539
how it's going to look like and you just

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:27,279
export the HTML and you continue

00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:30,559
tweaking that another tool we can use

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,230
seam roller so if you know don't like to

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,050
mess with CSS and you don't know the the

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:40,160
hexadecimal values for colors like I do

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:42,680
you can just go there and you are you

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:46,820
mess with that you pick different colors

00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:50,050
and you say that you want how you want

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:52,910
to basically style all of your elements

00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:55,850
okay it's not as complete as you would

00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:59,690
do on your own but it does help you to

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:02,330
at least match the color palette of your

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,880
of your corporate identity so if your

00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:07,280
colors are blue and orange then you can

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,150
you can put that in there and it will

00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:13,610
work very nicely a by default it comes

00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:15,710
with four swatches but you can customize

00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:18,650
these and create your own create your

00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:24,320
own icons as well many things you can do

00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:26,270
phonegap our life it's still actual so

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,150
basically it will convert your mobile UI

00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:31,940
to a native app doesn't offer you any

00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,860
additional capabilities but you can if

00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,050
you really want to encapsulate it and

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,030
have your own icon on the person's

00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:40,880
desktop then you can you can do that and

00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,460
it supports at the time I wrote these

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:46,100
slides a year ago it was supported seven

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,870
platforms and it says even more money so

00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,210
if you have a website you can just pour

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:54,050
it to mobile and and then have it

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:58,040
tweaked to your liking and that's pretty

00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:00,080
much it I guess I'm right on time so

00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,660
there's multiple resources i will post

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:05,300
all of this on my twitter account soon

00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,700
so i will upload that and just give you

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:11,080
a link to that and github so i have

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:13,220
business cards here i have some little

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:14,990
guidelines for writing unit tests

00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:20,080
unrelated to the stock but i have them

00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:20,080
