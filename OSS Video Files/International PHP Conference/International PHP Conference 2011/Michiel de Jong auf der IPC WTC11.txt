i makea I tell us something about you um

00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:19,529
I worked for an hosted which is a

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:27,090
non-profit project which came out of a

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:29,340
hobby holiday really I went this winter

00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,219
I went to barley for three months to

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,739
program on this hobby project and I call

00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:36,750
it unho steeper than then people told me

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,940
that if you quit your job in mobile

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,260
donations to work on this tell us what

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:47,010
happened um what Sun hosted and it's a

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:50,100
project to promote the separation

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:54,180
between applications and data in on the

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:57,960
web so we started out with talking a lot

00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,899
about in to end encryption and now we're

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,059
the thing we're focusing more on now is

00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,519
remote storage standards which season

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,650
saying everybody who provides per user

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,020
cloud storage should cross origin

00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,549
headers on there and I was and what

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,090
finger so that people can use that

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,450
storage from websites okay West is

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:23,549
important because right now people have

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,950
their data inside websites so people are

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:30,210
still used people still used to having a

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:32,610
date on the local hard disk but the way

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,740
things the direction things are going

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,720
people will have less and less control

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,340
over the data by having the hardest

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,140
because more of their data will be in

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,600
the cloud and in the ground it will be

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,280
inside websites where they don't have

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,220
control over so with the remote storage

00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,939
damn it the user can have their data in

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,740
a per-user cloud where they decide and

00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:54,869
any pro user stories that you get will

00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,670
be compatible with the rest of the web

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:03,210
so close the big future it looks like it

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:07,229
yeah different types of in different

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,940
types of ways there's probably six

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,190
different things that you can call

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,970
you can say infrastructure-as-a-service

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,620
cloud or flexibility or platform as a

00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:20,070
service or software as a service or

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,760
storage or a synchronization and all

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:26,880
these things are important so as yeah in

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,320
six different meanings of the word cloud

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,280
I think what things are going another

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:39,600
topic is freedom flap mm-hmm tell us

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:43,320
something Bob yeah that was um there was

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,350
a very inspiring talk by even Mullen

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:49,140
called freedom in the cloud which

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,030
inspired a lot of people to start

00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:58,080
projects and house it is one of those

00:02:51,030 --> 00:03:02,100
and it yes its freedom in the cloud is

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,840
sort of a term that sums up what we just

00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:09,090
said that your data is going to belong

00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,180
to companies where you're another

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:15,959
customer your product and we need to

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:21,510
keep the web open so that users have

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:25,950
control over your data and they can can

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:32,070
be free from monopolies and any other

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:38,310
forces that might want to infringe on

00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:40,530
your freedom like Apple well the Apple

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,510
will always do what they do and they do

00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,530
it very well so they just set a good

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:48,450
benchmark for the open web I think

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,340
whenever I Paul does something it's you

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,860
can say okay that's bad because it's a

00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,630
monopoly but that's not solve the

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:59,850
problem I think the open web should

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:04,590
always be at least as good as whatever

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:06,810
Apple does and that way and apples by

00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:09,420
presenting disclose system are actually

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:13,540
driving the development of the

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,570
because they remind us of what sort of

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:20,500
stuff we should be making to keep people

00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,230
used here using the open level finally

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,540
am your impressions from the IPC web

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:31,680
tech I think it's a great conference

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,680
yeah I I was it before I started this

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:39,760
project which is really mainly in

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:43,240
JavaScript I was at PHP developer and so

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,270
I relate a lot to and the Hulk buzz here

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,920
of and people developing an exciting

00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,810
stuff and I've been to a lot of the

00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,840
