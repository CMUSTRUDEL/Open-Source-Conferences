Title: HHVM: the alternative PHP Runtime - Sebastian Bergmann | IPC14
Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2014
Description: 
	The PHP language is almost 20 years old, as is its reference implementation that can be downloaded from PHP.net. In the last decade, alternative runtimes for PHP came and went. The HipHop VM (HHVM) that is developed – and used in production – by Facebook, however, is probably not only here to stay but very likely going to influence the future of PHP considerably. High time to have an in-depth look at what HHVM is and how it works. (Speaker: Sebastian Bergmann, thePHP.cc)
