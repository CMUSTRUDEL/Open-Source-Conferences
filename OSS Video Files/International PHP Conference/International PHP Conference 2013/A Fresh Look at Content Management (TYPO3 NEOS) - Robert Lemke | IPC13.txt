welcome to the Naas 10 talk it's been

00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,910
almost six years not that I've been

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,550
waiting for this talk actually we've

00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:26,939
been working a lot but finally this year

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,310
you will see the fruits of the all the

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,630
years so I don't know what made you

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,899
going into this talk anybody probably is

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:39,750
a developer anybody yeah most of you

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:45,020
guys who created his own content

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:47,640
management system recently anybody know

00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,239
that's interesting so you're all fresh

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,100
developers so I guess everybody kind of

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,500
created a content management system in

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,469
his life or at least the framework maybe

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:05,010
a framework some one of you yes a few

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:09,360
frameworks there welcome say was all

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:12,210
right so yeah my name is Robert I'm part

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,670
of the type of three community and i

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,030
started in that type of three committee

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,670
quite early that was ages ago and more

00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,360
than 10 years ago when type of three was

00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,850
originally published and since then i

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,299
had the pleasure to mostly work

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:34,290
full-time on the project also tightly on

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:39,119
customer related projects which used

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,590
something of the type 3 project so just

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,159
in case you have any questions also

00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:47,390
later on you can just tweet me directly

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:54,390
or also you get all the contact data of

00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:57,180
course so 2005 was a nice year because i

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,030
was looking much younger and we had some

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,600
nice time at some place in northern

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:07,170
denmark and i was also drinking that

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,989
beer back then that has changed a bit we

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,330
met there and that was a group of people

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,530
which was kind of the core team of type

00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,680
of feedback then

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:20,250
we met that that cozy place to discuss

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,110
the future of type of three and one

00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,880
thing we decided there was the vision

00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,550
for type of three for the project which

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:30,060
ended up in a new logo and everything

00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:33,750
you know today but also we agreed on a

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,209
road map for which contained something

00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:39,090
like Neos we didn't know that it would

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:40,470
be a completely new thing and we didn't

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,150
know that we would create a new

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,709
framework for it but at least there we

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:50,340
got the plan okay we need a better

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,660
architecture for type of three it took a

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,660
while but now we have nails we announced

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,730
it yes yesterday it's almost like

00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,800
yesterday it was last year when we

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,860
announced the first alpha version and a

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,910
lot of things happened since then and

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,360
just as a overview of how that fits into

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:16,440
this whole type of three thing so type

00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:20,070
of three is the type 3 project you can

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,170
see that a bit like if you want like the

00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,209
Apache foundation or something which is

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,310
the overall umbrella project for

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:27,930
different kinds of software and of

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,950
course we still have the type of three

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:35,750
CMS the software you probably know and

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:40,170
we also have flow anybody using flow

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:42,540
cool and now we also have Nia so there

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,489
are a range of new products coming out

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:46,829
of that community and since there's no

00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,370
company behind it we have that open

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:54,390
source project one of the major goals of

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:58,739
Nia's was a great user experience on all

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,829
levels and what does that mean it's

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:05,190
quite a fuzzy so we have different kinds

00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:08,130
of levels we have the sub user level and

00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:13,530
are the below user level and the above

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:15,690
code level so we are tackling both the

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,700
first thing we did was we wanted to

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,560
improve the user experience on the code

00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:22,109
level and wanted to create a framework

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,800
which is really a joy to work with in

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,970
your daily business and that is flow and

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,430
we share that we

00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,340
the community because we thought that it

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,710
might be useful for others as well it

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:37,920
was not our intention to create a new

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:40,350
product and you know compete against

00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,420
other frameworks or so it's just sharing

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:47,750
that because we think it's quite useful

00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:51,930
and on the user level we have nears and

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:54,270
which is a bit not so typical forum

00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,070
source projects we invest quite some

00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:59,850
time and effort into the whole user

00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:03,930
experience process so fortunately we

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:06,570
have one guy who leads this Erasmus

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:10,020
garden and what we want to achieve is

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:13,140
that you keep the flow on all levels so

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:15,360
you don't have distraction on the

00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,850
programming side it means you can just

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,770
code away and the infrastructure doesn't

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,440
stand in your way and in the user

00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:24,870
interface it means you concentrate on

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,120
the task you want to achieve that is the

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,050
website the content the articles

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,360
whatever you want to work on and we

00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,700
figured out that creating something

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,940
simple is quite difficult and quite

00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:42,870
complex because leaving things out means

00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:47,400
they need to be autumn eyes or they need

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:51,500
to have sensible defaults and we checked

00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:56,130
our concepts with a right big range of

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,620
experts so for example we were in Zurich

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,690
at information architects showed them

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,660
our user experience concept and the

00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:07,800
rasmus also met a few pretty cool guys

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:12,120
in London and we asked customers and did

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,610
surveys etc so we really put quite some

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,130
effort on on the user experience level

00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:21,090
and that's important to know when you

00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:23,970
see the product just a bit later one

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,700
part of that is also the design of

00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:32,490
course that's the most visible part

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,950
clearly and the design is distraction

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:38,160
free and that is part of the user

00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,520
experience led by Rasmus but we also

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,190
have the not so visible parts

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,050
in the beginning the conceptual parts

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,690
and that is the content strategy for

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,500
example so if you want to start a new

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:54,349
website without any design ideally is

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:56,690
just start with the content and then

00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:59,930
start creating the information

00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:02,720
architecture the the layout of your

00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:05,870
website the content flows and the design

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,240
so you really look at the important bit

00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:11,210
first the content and then afterwards

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,300
create all the stuff you need and for

00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,550
that we also have a new team member

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,729
Molly messy both from the United States

00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:23,419
who is covering that topic of content

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:25,340
strategy but if you look at these

00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,099
special topics it's cool that we have a

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:31,610
designer and content strategist in the

00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:34,669
team this won't work and the big scale

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,680
if for an open source project the

00:07:34,669 --> 00:07:40,550
important bit is that actually everybody

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:43,639
in the team is a user experience expert

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,789
because we are all users but we tend to

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,409
forget about it the problem is that when

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:51,800
you're developing you are on a such a

00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:54,620
detail level that you easily forget

00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,569
about the the global picture but it's

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,229
quite easy to make that a conscious step

00:07:56,569 --> 00:08:02,900
and just you know deploy your feature

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,900
and then try to use it from a user's

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,060
perspective just with common sense and

00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:11,120
then the problem is that usually you

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:14,750
cheat and you think yeah it's not so

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,270
cool but there's so much time I invested

00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,610
into it I cannot throw it away and and

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,909
that's basically the problem why most

00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:25,789
developers are not so user experience

00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:30,380
experts I mean they could be but it's a

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:34,190
conscious steps you have to take so I

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:37,669
said content is quite an important bit

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,110
in content management and and there are

00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:42,500
all kinds of things you can do with

00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:47,450
content who's has been using type of

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,339
three from you oh yeah and you know

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:51,290
they're in type of three there are all

00:08:49,339 --> 00:08:54,350
kinds of concepts for content there's

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,630
the built-in content types

00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:00,080
you have flexible content you have grid

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:03,050
elements and so there are different

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,750
concepts and nothing is really kind of a

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:07,940
first-class citizen in the type of three

00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:11,900
world because it's just added on later

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:15,020
off later on and content needs to be

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,120
flexible and nails all content is

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:20,360
flexible by default so there's no

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,790
difference between a text text with

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,130
image built-in content type or a

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:29,750
flexible content element you edit later

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:34,130
on mmm every content is based on a

00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:35,900
certain type which is defined and the

00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:41,210
whole content is stored in a Content

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:43,490
repository so why is that a Content

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:45,430
repository a Content repository in our

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:50,480
case is just the layout on top of

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:53,000
regular database and if you have

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:56,690
flexible content and hierarchical

00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,550
content and introduce new content types

00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,670
then theoretically you need to change

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,670
the database schema you have new tables

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:07,430
new properties etc that's always a

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:11,270
problem especially with migration of

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,070
content and all that and in a Content

00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:14,870
repository you don't have that the

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,110
content is stored in a way you don't

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,960
care about it's the content repository

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,790
has its own table structure and it now

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:27,520
allows you to create all kinds of

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:30,290
flexible data structures on top of it so

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,590
what you see here for example is you

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:37,100
have a site rude then a website a home

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:39,560
page and you see the italic part of that

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,840
that's the content type and that's just

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:47,150
how the whole content is structured in

00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:49,450
the US it's a tree of some type it

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:52,280
doesn't have to be a page tree actually

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,500
so we do still have a page tree in

00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,720
neil's but it doesn't have to be it

00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,760
could be an article tree or product tree

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,470
if you like it could be that you're

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,520
using nails for something which doesn't

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:07,220
have pages at all and that is very easy

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,150
to to do with a Content repository and

00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:12,370
you have some very

00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:16,960
nice and easy ap is on a PHP level to

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:19,400
create new nodes to define types and to

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:27,020
traverse through the content or et

00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:29,210
cetera so the other part is the editing

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:32,540
so how do you get the content into the

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:35,120
system and back when type of three was

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:39,320
created there was just this classic

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,540
approach where you create a type of

00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,430
three installation edit your content in

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,070
that installation and then publish it

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,820
with type of three and this has changed

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:52,550
quite radically in many cases so you

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,430
need to draw and pull in a lot of

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:57,560
content for example if you have a

00:11:55,430 --> 00:12:00,890
magazine website then you have some

00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,820
feeds probably of articles you want to

00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:07,100
process and it's also not said that you

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:10,790
publish this to just one device or one

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:12,890
location and it's could be that also not

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:16,850
just your content management system is

00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:23,390
the system which publishes could be

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:25,910
something else so it's important still

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:28,310
to be able to edit content in your

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,010
system and we wanted to make that a

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,440
really great experience because I don't

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,960
know if you plan to create a long

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,500
article you write a long article and for

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,600
me personally that takes ages I can

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,870
spend a whole day or two writing an

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,270
article would you do that in the web

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:51,970
browser for one and a half days who

00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:55,310
would do that you don't trust it right

00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:57,980
and that happened too many times that

00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:59,420
you hit the wrong key and then the

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,920
browser goes back and then the whole

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:06,440
forum is gone etc and we want that never

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,720
to happen again so the content editing

00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:10,880
experience must be safe and really nice

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,270
to do so you don't think about copy and

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:18,320
paste in the first place one problem

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:21,649
with editing is the abstraction so just

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:24,889
take a look at this website here

00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:28,309
and it has all kinds of different

00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:33,769
elements it has a slider up there it has

00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:35,209
different teasers and plugins now what

00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:40,429
do you imagine how does that look like

00:13:35,209 --> 00:13:42,019
in the back end interpret we I won't be

00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:44,089
able to show you the whole back end

00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:47,959
because it won't fit but this is a

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:50,079
quarter of it from this page it's just

00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:54,740
the left part the upper left part and

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:58,100
it's not so bad I mean there are great

00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:00,319
tools you can use in type of three grid

00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,980
elements or temple of Allah or some

00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:06,679
other extensions and they all do a great

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:09,679
job but it has its limits I mean as soon

00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:12,110
as you have a complex page you

00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,879
completely lose the overview and you

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,639
feel the urge to switch back and forth

00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:18,290
between front end and back end so you

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,569
write something then you save and then

00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:26,360
you go to the front and again and check

00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:30,319
how it looks like um but I mean we do

00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,139
have rich text editors but sometimes

00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:36,790
they are a bit too rich I mean they give

00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:39,459
you all kinds of editing possibilities

00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,259
like like in word where you have these

00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:46,370
lots of the big tool bar with all the

00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:50,149
buttons and the point is I mean a modern

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:52,699
web site shouldn't actually shouldn't

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,100
allow you to use all these styling

00:14:52,699 --> 00:14:57,800
methods because the website should

00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,449
follow a certain design scheme layout

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,929
scheme it shouldn't even allow you to

00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:05,179
set a image width or height for the

00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:07,999
uploaded images I mean that doesn't make

00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:10,759
sense anyway because for responsive

00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:15,439
websites which pixel width do you enter

00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:20,660
there for which break point and screen

00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:23,299
resolution so these rich text editors

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,610
are nice but still you don't see the

00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,470
website which is behind it you only see

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,689
a fragment of the website and the

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:34,819
solution for that theoretically is in

00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:35,300
place editing so in place editing just

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:39,220
means

00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:42,560
you know you go to that website here and

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,350
just click on the part you want to edit

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:49,430
and then you just edited where the

00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:50,959
content is sounds pretty logic and this

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:54,440
is also something which you don't really

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:57,110
have to explain to someone but there are

00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,269
lots of problems with that and I'll tell

00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:02,899
you later because other content

00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:06,399
management systems also tribe that now

00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:10,250
if you edit on the web page right away

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,380
what happens with all the typos and I

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:16,220
mean your work in progress shouldn't be

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:19,070
visible to the live web site so in type

00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:21,230
of three when you save something it

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:26,329
usually ends up in the life on the live

00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:29,269
website we have work spaces as a concept

00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:33,230
near since the beginning so for a couple

00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:34,970
of years it's already in there and that

00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,700
makes it much easier for us to implement

00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:39,410
it because if you have it in your

00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:42,079
architecture from the beginning it's

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:44,390
easier to implement then if you add it

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:49,310
on top of an existing content management

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:52,520
system you will always work in your own

00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:55,339
personal workspace so you'll never work

00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:58,310
on the live website actually it's not

00:16:55,339 --> 00:17:00,829
possible at all but you have a very easy

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:06,020
way to publish your content to the live

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:09,709
website the easy thing would be just you

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:14,540
press the publish button and the content

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:17,780
or the work space works pretty similar

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:20,530
to type of three in in terms of the

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:23,959
concept so you have the live website and

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:26,839
your own workspace is kind of a layer on

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,660
top of that live website and the live

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,640
website shines through so if someone

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:35,480
else publishes a change you will

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,940
immediately see it in your workspace but

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:42,530
as soon as you touch one of the content

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,660
elements kind of you modify them then

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:48,049
they will be lifted into your own work

00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:50,840
page and workspace

00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:52,879
and all the rest content is still the

00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:54,889
live content which might change but the

00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:57,350
the content you started changing in your

00:17:54,889 --> 00:18:01,399
workspace is then decoupled from the

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:04,820
life website for us type of three guys

00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:06,739
that sounds quite normal but there's

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:08,899
hardly any content management system

00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:10,970
which does it that way mostly what they

00:18:08,899 --> 00:18:12,799
do is they copy the whole life website

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,970
into your own workspace then you change

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:20,779
it and then you publish it again all

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:25,009
right um so here's a demo now for the

00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:27,559
for the simple parts I'll just do the

00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:29,899
pre-recorded one because switching the

00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:35,739
meringue is this quite of bad kind of

00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:38,899
bad um so you have this website here and

00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:41,450
you can just browse it of course so I

00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:43,369
just go to some page where I have some

00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:48,320
text and images I have some columns

00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:52,039
there some multi-column elements and if

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,470
you want to edit that aniyah's what you

00:18:52,039 --> 00:19:00,609
basically do is you log into the back

00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:00,609
end so there's the login screen of Neos

00:19:01,629 --> 00:19:08,629
and then you basically end up at the

00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:12,200
same place where you've been you just

00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:15,379
see that there's a small tool bar up

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,509
there and you can just click into the

00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:21,499
content you want to edit just type

00:19:17,509 --> 00:19:23,480
something there unfortunately this is an

00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:25,249
alpha version from last night so there's

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,859
a bit you see in the upper right corner

00:19:25,249 --> 00:19:31,190
the saved stuff is behind some other

00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:34,669
text that has been fixed today but

00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:36,590
anyway it's saved immediately but if you

00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:38,059
switch to the live website no

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,950
nothing really changed because you're

00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:42,799
working in your own personal workspace

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,440
so if you publish it and then we load

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:50,119
then you see actually the changes quite

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,070
easy so and the publish button can also

00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:56,240
trigger some other workflows if you like

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:58,669
for things which are not visible on the

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,100
website you have the inspector so you

00:19:58,669 --> 00:20:01,880
see currently the pages in focus where

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,910
you can change

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,600
page title or the URL so something like

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:12,560
real URL is integrated in this but a bit

00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,500
easier to handle so you can just change

00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,940
the website I cannot stop right now

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,410
because it's running either but

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:25,070
afterwards you see that allow changes

00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:27,830
and so I can publish that they're safe

00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:30,380
website and you see it also changes the

00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:33,470
menu one Drupal guy just asked me but

00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:36,610
how do you change the menus items we how

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:42,260
do you change them manually it works

00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:44,000
funny a funny question so you see you

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,740
also have something like the template

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,030
selector you can choose from a different

00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:52,070
layout here i'll choose publication date

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:55,010
when the page changes should be

00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:59,390
published et cetera just the basic stuff

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:01,640
and that's available in the inspector so

00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,890
and from there you can actually collapse

00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,870
that again if you have very little space

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:08,330
like on this Bemis base year and you

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,130
have navigate button up there which

00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:12,290
shows you something like the page tree

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:16,370
but as I said it could also be an

00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:20,450
article tree or product tree and you can

00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:22,370
just use that to navigate go to the

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,340
different pages you can of course also

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:30,050
just use the web site's navigation to go

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:35,330
to your page and so collapse it again

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:38,930
there you are back and I think did I

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,180
show anything more oh yeah right so it

00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,630
could be that you have a multi-column

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,490
element so now I selected the whole a

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,590
multi-column element and sometimes it's

00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:51,140
difficult to navigate there and for that

00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:54,170
you have some additional tree which

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:57,560
shows you only the navigation from your

00:21:54,170 --> 00:22:00,140
current web page so you can click there

00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:02,860
on the content collection for the first

00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:05,320
column for the second column etc and

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:12,770
actually you can use drag and drop to

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:18,290
change content there whoops

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:21,050
okay so content changed that is a little

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:24,650
helper if you have complex layouts like

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:27,220
the type 3 dark web the front page where

00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:32,360
you have all kinds of nested elements

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:35,930
right okay and also will have modules

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,470
this is completely unstyled but this is

00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:42,590
the workspaces module you know just to

00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:44,930
show okay there will be custom modules

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:48,080
also you can have and user management or

00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,690
that that's also still there but we try

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,790
to keep you on the live web site or on

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,560
the website two years ago I think we

00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:01,940
started creating something like the list

00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,160
module and we try to push that into the

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,860
future as much as we can we try to solve

00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:10,190
everything we can with the possibilities

00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,840
I've just shown you maybe at some point

00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:14,240
we need something like a list module

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,760
where you have some more powerful

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,400
editing capital capabilities but

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,700
currently were quite happy with this one

00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:26,420
what I forgot to mention his work spaces

00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:29,110
can actually be nested so you can create

00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:32,450
a new workspace Christmas campaign and

00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:34,160
then instead of publishing to the

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:36,320
live-work space you can publish to the

00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,050
Christmas campaign a workspace and let

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,500
your workspace be bet based on that so

00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:46,100
we you can prepare that within a team

00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:47,990
basically but it always works that you

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,820
are work working directly in your own

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:57,140
workspace and then publish to some other

00:23:49,820 --> 00:24:00,970
work space all right so there hopefully

00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:03,800
will be more questions I I guess and

00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:08,120
i'll if we have the time i can show you

00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:10,070
some more features so in place editing

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,740
is quite a cool thing because it's

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:17,060
intuitive and everything but the problem

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:19,880
is in place editing won't work for

00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:23,480
example what happens if you take that

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:27,040
content first strategy and your website

00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,330
and the beginning looks like this

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:32,900
you don't have a design yet because

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:35,929
ideally you create the design after you

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:40,370
created the content so where do you edit

00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:43,760
your content for that we have something

00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:46,070
called the wireframe mode and I won't

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:53,270
come a run I need to show that life

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:55,520
because I didn't record that and also I

00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:59,840
have to say that wireframe mode is only

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,860
the working title for it okay so you see

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,860
the the website again

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:17,650
let's say I'm on this page here and I

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,470
don't have a page template yet then

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:23,779
nails will end up in a wireframe mode

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:26,270
which doesn't look so nicely styled at

00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:29,870
this moment but actually it's using some

00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:33,470
internal templating and so if you're

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:36,230
familiar with fluid templates in type of

00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,929
three already or with flow all this is

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:41,659
based on fluid templates so you can

00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:43,250
actually I will make that a bit nicer

00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:45,500
for the foundries but you can actually

00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:50,270
create your own templates which are used

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:53,809
for the wireframe mode and which is

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:57,049
maybe a sketchy real you know like a

00:25:53,809 --> 00:25:59,090
tool you use for wireframing anybody

00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:02,899
uses a certain tool for creating

00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:05,960
wireframes for website anybody you yeah

00:26:02,899 --> 00:26:09,350
and I think it should be perfectly

00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:12,380
possible to use nails for that because

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:15,260
you can just create it set off content

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:18,710
types and have templates for that and

00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:22,159
then just use a empty nails installation

00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:25,010
to start creating your layout your

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,140
content areas then choose different

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,500
color profiles for hot content and not

00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:33,110
so important content etc and actually I

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,600
could imagine that you use nails in a

00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:37,970
workshop with your customer for creating

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,649
a prototype of the content structure of

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:43,010
the website just discussing things

00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:49,190
doesn't need to be used afterwards but

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:53,360
you could so wireframe mode is just one

00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:55,970
of the things we plan into the in that

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,210
regard you see you few more editing

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:02,779
modes we actually have an integrators

00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:06,080
guide so if you go to docs type of 30

00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:09,470
org and then this is pretty difficult to

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,049
catch this you go to version latest you

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:15,049
know and then you get the latest version

00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:18,440
and you see we have a integrator guide

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:22,760
here and we have an integrator cookbook

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,389
where we collect all kinds of recipes we

00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,919
found like

00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:33,859
how to render emitter navigation etc so

00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:37,309
just the 32nd gimmick I want to show you

00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:39,259
here down below you have a future which

00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:41,359
should appear on every web page right

00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,070
and usually you make that a content

00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,099
element which is on a page in the hidden

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,929
Seuss folder somewhere in type 3 and

00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:50,749
this is just type of script and I can

00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:56,389
just type here and go to a different

00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:58,099
page and whoops and so it's still there

00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:59,929
so that's the easiest thing for an

00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:03,139
editor to have a universal footer for

00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:05,389
all pages it's just I think four lines

00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:07,729
of type of script these things we also

00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:10,039
have in the cookbook it's really

00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:12,440
important to see nails as a different

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:16,639
product yeah so for many things you

00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,679
won't need plugins as I say so I I'm

00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:21,409
curious what kind of plugins will come

00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:23,690
up people will come up and also they

00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:25,369
will come up with node types for example

00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:29,450
which they put into packages so you

00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:31,099
share all kinds of node types but i

00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:33,139
think it's not so critical for the

00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:36,739
community because the transition has

00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:38,989
been much slower and over the years then

00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:42,289
for example now with drupal 8 and

00:28:38,989 --> 00:28:45,049
symphony that's a real big clash because

00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:48,979
Drupal had a completely different inner

00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:51,709
workings then then symphony has and so I

00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:54,169
think by introducing xbase years ago and

00:28:51,709 --> 00:29:00,070
fluid the transition is much smoother

00:28:54,169 --> 00:29:03,950
but for new projects it's important I

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:06,829
mean for a major relaunch then you need

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,739
to look does type of we fit the feature

00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:11,570
set or Neos and if nails has the

00:29:09,739 --> 00:29:14,899
features you need then that's a perfect

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:17,479
opportunity to to use it because you can

00:29:14,899 --> 00:29:20,709
important the content for relaunch you

00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:24,649
usually start with the new design or

00:29:20,709 --> 00:29:26,570
different design at least and to be

00:29:24,649 --> 00:29:29,629
honest the most projects i have seen

00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:32,749
don't use so many plugins from the condo

00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:36,889
from the extension repository so most

00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:37,309
agencies have that 10 15 extensions they

00:29:36,889 --> 00:29:39,320
use

00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,299
on every project again and that's

00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:44,149
something you have to start with again

00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:47,210
of course but at least you can use your

00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:51,769
knowledge and and for some dirty stuff

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:55,519
away along the way but I think in

00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:57,230
general there are not so many I will

00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,940
have to find out which plugins are

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:03,499
interesting it won't be the same like

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:07,759
with type of three alright so that

00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:10,220
solves part of the problem and but there

00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:13,190
are still things which don't fit really

00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,159
into in place editing and that is what

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,470
you see is what you get I mean that is

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,600
basically the idea you go to the web

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,820
page and then you have your employees

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:27,110
editing and the editor things oh great

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:29,240
this is how it's going to look like but

00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:31,519
it's not I mean it's look it looks like

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,070
that in your browser at this time with

00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:39,919
these settings you know and nobody else

00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:44,149
will ever see it like you so that that's

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:48,080
led to other projects completely going

00:30:44,149 --> 00:30:51,080
away from in place editing again because

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,110
they think it's a lie I mean we have we

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,049
need to publish data for a content for

00:30:54,110 --> 00:31:01,070
different devices etc but the important

00:30:57,049 --> 00:31:03,919
bit is that that you actually need some

00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:06,200
way to play with your content it doesn't

00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,179
matter if it's looking like exactly like

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:10,879
on your screen but you want to play with

00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:14,179
it and see how would it look like more

00:31:10,879 --> 00:31:16,759
or less on a mobile phone or how would

00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:19,879
it look like with a different screen

00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:22,999
resolution in general so editing and

00:31:19,879 --> 00:31:25,669
previewing are directly connected and

00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:29,029
that's what I notice at least one i'm

00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:30,889
editing i save it and go to the front

00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:33,139
page and i want to see how it looks like

00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:36,710
even if i know that it will not

00:31:33,139 --> 00:31:39,350
perfectly look like that so we came up

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:42,590
with a whole concept for previewing and

00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:46,220
editing the names change bit currently

00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:48,559
but you see this down below is a website

00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,809
or part of it and up there you see

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:57,950
there's a new toolbar and they

00:31:50,809 --> 00:32:00,409
edit content and preview central we

00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:03,049
probably rename the left one to editing

00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:04,820
experience so that you choose what kind

00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:08,990
of editing experience would you like to

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:10,700
have so a realistic front end editing

00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,710
experience or the more abstract

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,110
wireframe experience there are some

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:18,950
others we have in mind and actually you

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:21,080
can add your own and the second part is

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,149
the preview so you can actually switch

00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:28,690
between editing and preview right away

00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:31,429
without switching the browser window and

00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,379
currently I have the desktop template

00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:39,080
mobile search you can create anything

00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:42,649
you want that for example search I don't

00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,230
know if if you ever figure it okay so i

00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:47,990
added all this metadata to my article

00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,539
but how will it look like in in google

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,460
and you just click on the search preview

00:32:50,539 --> 00:32:55,220
and then you see your current web page

00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:58,519
oh yeah this is what how it would google

00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:02,019
would compile the data into some some

00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,759
output and there are lots of more

00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:07,700
devices and things you could integrate I

00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:10,490
mean this little printer for example but

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,860
we think that this concept of switching

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,259
between editing and preview is quite

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:21,919
powerful and also that you need

00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:25,309
different editing modes so that was much

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:29,809
about the conceptual part you also want

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:32,110
to see some code I guess and maybe once

00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:35,840
see how powerful that actually is mmm

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,610
one thing I mentioned is that the whole

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,369
content is stored in a Content

00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:43,190
repository that's quite abstract it has

00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:45,830
nodes and some of them can be pages and

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,049
can be headlines etc and we have a

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,169
schema for these nodes and that is

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:53,869
called a node type quite simple so the

00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:58,279
page just is defined by the page node

00:33:53,869 --> 00:34:00,980
type and this is how you define a node

00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,409
type so you see at the right hand side

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,730
something the inspector would show for a

00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:09,290
new node type

00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:11,869
chapter of a book and on the left hand

00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:16,550
side you see the yellow which would be

00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:19,100
necessary to define this currently it's

00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:22,280
just a yellow configuration you add but

00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:25,270
we can easily create a user interface on

00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,800
top of that which would even allow

00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:31,129
editors to create their own new content

00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:36,409
types but the nice thing is this is all

00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:39,350
which is necessary there is no PHP code

00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:41,929
added to it I mean I like PHP a lot but

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:45,409
if it's not necessary I can also live

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:47,359
with configuration and just by defining

00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,790
the properties and how they should look

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:57,230
like in the UI is sufficient there's no

00:34:49,790 --> 00:35:00,410
SQL you need to add etc one other

00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:02,660
example is from from my website I'm

00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:04,310
running my block with Neos and in the

00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:07,880
beginning it was a flow plug-in

00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:10,840
flow-based plugin so now its content

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,540
type so instead of a page I just have a

00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:18,050
block node type where I can set the

00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:20,990
publication date of course and and the

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:24,950
title etc and I can use regular content

00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:28,280
elements for my blog posts clearly and

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:31,250
the comments are actually content types

00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:33,970
as well so instead of creating a plugin

00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:37,640
which would enable you to to create

00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:42,470
comments i just used i created a new

00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:45,020
content element type and the form which

00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:47,510
would send your comment is basically

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:51,340
sending a post request on a rest service

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:55,369
which creates a new node of type comment

00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:56,900
it just has this special policy that you

00:35:55,369 --> 00:36:03,770
don't need to be locked in to do that

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:06,410
and also listing the latest post and

00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:08,560
showing the latest biggest post and a

00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,780
different way is just a matter of

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,400
varying your content repository and you

00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,400
won't need a plugin for that

00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:28,050
but you need typescript so typescript is

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:32,600
still there we completely rewrote the

00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:36,510
passer it's now object-oriented it is

00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:39,680
very consistent and we've got much more

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:43,440
powerful but also easy to learn I think

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,780
anyway it's important to know the role

00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,670
of typescript because typescript and

00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,800
history has been used for all kinds of

00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:54,000
things for configuration for templating

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:58,020
for as a model for all kinds of

00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,190
interesting stuff in nails type of

00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:05,460
script is basically a presentation model

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:08,960
so what does that mean you have your

00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:12,000
templates your fluid templates which

00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,280
have all the markup you have your page

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,470
template based on fluid but also every

00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:21,090
content element every content type has a

00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:23,400
fluid template there is no HTML code in

00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:28,170
the near score it's all in fluid

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:30,780
templates and on the other hand you have

00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:33,090
the content repository and in between

00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,610
you need something which prepares the

00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:42,330
data and puts it into the fluid

00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:48,090
templates and that is type of script so

00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:50,210
as an example on a web on a homepage you

00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:52,950
have this kind of teaser you know from

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:55,950
from a magazine and there's a content

00:37:52,950 --> 00:38:00,000
management section and this teaser is

00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:02,460
supposed to show you the latest article

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,710
of a certain subsection and that could

00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,420
be in nested trees or below content

00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:11,900
management maybe you have open source

00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:15,170
and not so powerful systems etc and and

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,390
you want to have the first image of that

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:22,140
article even if it if it may be used

00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:24,000
later on in the article you want to have

00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,180
the headline and you want to have the

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,310
first blob of text and of course crop

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,320
that after a certain

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:37,980
amount of characters and not in the

00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:40,380
middle of of the word so what you would

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:42,420
do in news is you don't create a plugin

00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,340
for that you create a new content type

00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:48,660
and you say this is a highlight teaser

00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:51,450
for example and for the editor in the

00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:54,420
back end he would see this inspector

00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:57,240
here and that's a selector box where you

00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,330
can choose the section content

00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,760
management gadgets coffee whatever and

00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:07,830
then the teaser will show the latest

00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:11,700
article from that section so that would

00:39:07,830 --> 00:39:15,350
be the user experience and now i'm going

00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:15,350
to show you the type of script of that

00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:25,080
so this needs a bit explanation but it's

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:28,680
quite powerful so first of all you see

00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:31,500
in the in line two we define a prototype

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:37,590
so type of script is now prototypical

00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:41,100
that means in PHP you have classes and

00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:43,140
objects but every time you create an

00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:45,390
instance of a class so every time you

00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,570
create an object would be nice if you

00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,190
could set some default values this is

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:56,040
basically what you achieve with a

00:39:50,190 --> 00:40:02,070
prototype so you say so the template

00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:05,010
that is kind of the PHP class and a PHP

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:09,090
class of template on an object of

00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:12,330
template has a certain default setup and

00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:16,020
I copy that to a new prototype and I

00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:17,820
call that teaser so now I have a

00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:21,870
completely new content type and type of

00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,600
script and I'm going to use that so I

00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,720
prepare a few properties now which I

00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,340
later on can use in in my fluid template

00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,750
so all the properties you see here

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:38,070
section note article note text image are

00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:40,920
variables in your fluid template and so

00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:42,870
you see section node q that means

00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,520
section or query

00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:47,040
and then on the right-hand side we use

00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,220
something we call flow query and if you

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:53,430
have ever used jquery you should feel

00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,760
quite at home because this is a correct

00:40:53,430 --> 00:41:01,410
very language which allows you to find

00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:04,890
nodes in the tree so in this case I say

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:08,790
ok start a query at the site note that's

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:11,370
the uppermost node and then find home /

00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:15,300
and whatever has been selected in the

00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:19,950
selector box so home / coffee home /

00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:22,500
content management and then I use that

00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:26,610
we use that query in article node q and

00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:30,480
I say okay this section node query from

00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:34,230
there on for starting with that find the

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,150
most recent and then it must be an

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:39,930
article it should be an image or

00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:42,630
whatever and ordered by date published

00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:47,310
and just one of that so with that you

00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:49,740
get the most recent article and then

00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:52,110
text and image is just using what you

00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,570
found there so text for example says

00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:59,520
okay find the first text content element

00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:02,940
within that article and text process

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:08,070
says process whatever you found with a

00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:11,490
processor in this crap at word 175

00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:15,120
characters so that is all the technical

00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:17,760
detail you need to implement this this

00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:23,190
teaser you don't create a plugin for

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:27,030
that of course admittedly you need to

00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,830
learn float fairy but it's not so hard

00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,870
because you can use a lot of examples

00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,880
and then just copy and paste and see

00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:39,990
what happens if you use children parents

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:42,960
etc it's quite easy okay so I mentioned

00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,850
you don't have to use PHP there's no

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,530
plugin needed so are we so afraid of

00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:52,500
plugins no absolutely not I mean flow is

00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:55,800
a beautiful framework to create plugins

00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,549
with and if you started your standalone

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,029
application

00:42:56,549 --> 00:43:02,939
or just write your own plugin you can

00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:08,069
use any action controller of flow and

00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:09,569
convert it into a plug-in and again this

00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:14,579
is the type of script you need to do

00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:19,109
that so if you just define a new type of

00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:26,239
Script object type and say which package

00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:30,779
which controller is responsible for so

00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:33,689
now you've got the overview a bit at

00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:38,519
least the conceptual part the user

00:43:33,689 --> 00:43:45,449
experience the editing concept and also

00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:47,939
the content repository part there's a

00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:50,219
lot more to tell of course so I had

00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:52,949
really to restrict myself to put this

00:43:50,219 --> 00:44:03,900
into this presentation and now the

00:43:52,949 --> 00:44:10,969
question is of course when so yes and we

00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:22,949
we do have a date so it will be a

00:44:10,969 --> 00:44:27,749
December 10th very good this and so I

00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:29,609
say tentative dates because quality

00:44:27,749 --> 00:44:32,819
decides that's pretty clear but

00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:34,619
currently it looks very good we have

00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:37,979
some stability issues in the user

00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:40,679
interface / in JavaScript parks etc but

00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:43,890
we'll publish the first beta release on

00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:46,559
November 12 which is quite soon and then

00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:49,199
two weeks later we plan to have a second

00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:52,170
beta release where we add some parts of

00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:57,900
the media management which by the way I

00:44:52,170 --> 00:45:00,150
didn't show it all and yeah so we're

00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:01,769
quite confident that it will be December

00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:03,719
10th also because I have a customer

00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:06,799
project currently running which has a

00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:06,799
launch date before that

00:45:06,850 --> 00:45:12,140
so if you want to try what I've just

00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:15,620
shown you of course you can download

00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:20,360
nails will publish alpha alpha release

00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:22,670
today another one alpha 7 but you can

00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,950
also try alpha 6 and the easiest way to

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,820
do that without installing it is

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:30,050
currently to just go to launcher calm

00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:34,820
enter your email address and then you

00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:36,530
get a free the virtual server with nails

00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:40,370
pre-installed so you can just click

00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:43,400
around a bit and yeah if you have any

00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:45,440
questions later on I'm very happy to

00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,830
answer that also to show you some some

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:52,810
