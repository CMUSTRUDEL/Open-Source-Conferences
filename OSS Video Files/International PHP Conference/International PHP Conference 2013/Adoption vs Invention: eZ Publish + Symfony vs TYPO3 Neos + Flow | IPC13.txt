hello ladies and gentlemen i'm eric

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,260
herman from PHP magazine de reporting

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:20,039
from the International pete p conference

00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:23,580
i'm here with robert lemke representing

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:27,210
the type of three Neos project and with

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:32,090
nikola pasterino representing ez publish

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,730
and today we're talking about

00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:40,800
implementing and a strange framework

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:43,850
symfony2 into an existing product ez

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,629
publish or starting from scratch

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:52,980
inventing a known framework flow 3 and

00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:58,260
putting this into a new product Neos so

00:00:52,980 --> 00:01:02,190
um Nicola what do you think are the pros

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:06,180
and cons of the choices you made with

00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:08,670
adopting a framework already existing so

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,780
we wanted to adopt an existing framework

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,420
because you didn't want to do it

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,909
ourselves again basically we had this

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,610
legacy in easy published 3 & 4 where we

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:20,570
had built the entire framework low-level

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,790
framework ourselves so the libraries and

00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:25,979
this is not the core business so to say

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,500
of a content management system or like

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:30,180
ez publish but rather we wanted to rely

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,220
on on other communities open source

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,130
communities that do that better than us

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,229
and maintain it better so we can focus

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,030
on the heart of the matter which is

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,610
really the core content management

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,439
features and all that comes on top so

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,049
beat customer experience management

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,049
features plugins to external tools and

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:50,490
yeah so that's why we chose to have an

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,369
external framework and then we run a

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:56,040
benchmark on the existing frameworks the

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,380
ones that came to the list were against

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,189
amongst others as n framework to and

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,939
Symphony to and ye also owe you all Y as

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:07,649
some call it and after a sharp benchmark

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:10,590
and strict conditions we just went for

00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,080
symfony2 for the product itself for

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,010
there was a vendor also a company behind

00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,230
it that can

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,000
up and provide support and first and

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:21,810
foremost for the community which is

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,480
really growing a lot based in Europe

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,519
quite a lot just like ez publish mostly

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,900
but having a food in the u.s. like us so

00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,209
we saw their words there were good

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,120
seeing similarities and good synergies

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:41,459
that would just fit yeah okay thank you

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:45,720
Robert did the neos project also think

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:49,109
about moving to other frameworks or did

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,430
you just start from scratch from the

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:55,889
very first second now in our case it was

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:57,480
like seven years ago when we found out

00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:59,879
that type of three our content

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,190
management system had some problems with

00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,340
the architecture and so at least we saw

00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:07,680
in long term it wouldn't fit our needs

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,889
to the projects we were doing and so at

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,629
that time PHP looked quite different and

00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:17,459
we explored techniques from other

00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,930
programming languages as well so for

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:21,810
example domain driven design was

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:25,590
something we stumbled upon and also

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,569
dependency injection and so we had to

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,560
create our own framework at that time

00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:34,290
and because it was just necessary for

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,349
our CMS but we also then later on decide

00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:40,129
to release it because we thought it's

00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:43,739
it's quite useful for others I mean

00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:49,319
Symphony nowadays and and flow share a

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:51,900
lot of approaches they are quite modern

00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:55,560
frameworks and they have based on design

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,319
design patterns etc but still flow has a

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,870
has a slightly different approach a

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,099
different flavor so to speak so it's

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:08,549
more an overall concept for many things

00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:12,180
whereas in symphony you can also build

00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:15,419
your own framework based on symphony so

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,380
we have more the the architecture is

00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:21,810
already given in flow and the the way

00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,510
how you probably deployed etc how you

00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:26,310
store your data and it's more

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:33,570
opinionated

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:36,780
and symphony thank you so when you chose

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:45,240
symphony and you had your ez publish

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:48,060
product how easy was it to say we make

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,310
own ideas possible in a strange

00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,470
framework or was it sometimes

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,410
complicated more complicated and doing

00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:57,870
own implementations there are always

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,340
trade-offs to do right there are things

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,740
that you could do probably more quickly

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,139
by doing it on your own and others that

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,360
you you would take more way far more

00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,520
long far longer and then by using an

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,580
external framework but all in all at

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,410
looking at the main the main integration

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,030
challenges and we just just like type

00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:16,800
also the nails we revamped our

00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,970
architecture from the for logic series

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,650
to the fibrotic series quite drastically

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,750
we're now really oriented we have a

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,000
clear service layers that are defined

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,979
and where we can enforce bc and below

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,380
which we just can do what we want

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:34,110
basically and it's it's a future-proof

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,729
architecture that we've built and after

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,720
we have enlisted the main possible pain

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:41,280
points and challenges that we would face

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,169
we really understood that most of the

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,120
most of the points most of those

00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:47,910
challenges would be partially if not

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,180
entirely solved by by using symfony2 and

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,470
the rest a handful would have to take a

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:56,000
bit more time than doing it on our own

00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,740
but for the sake of sticking to a choice

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,870
we would we were really happy to go with

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,430
infinity with that so the costs cost /

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,020
benefit trade-off was reading the favor

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:09,590
of the benefits in this in this case

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:13,919
yeah and the other way around a robot

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:18,000
can the flow framework be used for other

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:19,979
things than Neos yes we we really made

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,840
it so you can create your own standalone

00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:25,169
applications of course and it's also

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:29,070
used that way so the basic idea is that

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:32,789
you have a powerful framework for the

00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:35,430
bigger applications bigger a PHP

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,530
applications which you eventually can if

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:39,840
you want integrate into a content

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:42,120
management system I mean

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,430
we really came from the other way round

00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,850
so Symphony came from the framework side

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:49,889
and now started bit are creating content

00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:51,479
management framework on top of it and we

00:06:49,889 --> 00:06:54,360
came from the content management side

00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:57,990
and we're looking for a framework which

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,770
was directly supporting that that kind

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:03,330
of applications we were doing but it's a

00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:05,030
bit more high level of the flow

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,620
framework is a bit more higher level

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:12,120
which means we are also actually using

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,940
some Symphony components and and so I

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,700
mean that makes a lot of sense to not

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,410
create everything on your own and in

00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,710
terms of libraries and smaller

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,590
components that's actually quite quite

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,380
nice to reuse stuff and we also plan to

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,240
decouple a few things from flow so that

00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,210
could for example our templating engine

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,889
fluid that that could actually be used

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:41,190
in symphony that would be quite nice

00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:44,340
okay um that's it I think thank you

00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:47,880
gentlemen Nicola pasterino oh but Lemke

00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:54,260
it was a pleasure talking to you good

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,260
