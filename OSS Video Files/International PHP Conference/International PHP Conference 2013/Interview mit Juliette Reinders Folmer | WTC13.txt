hi there i'm tom from sherman peach p

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,300
magazine I'm here with a very impressive

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,730
in a very powerful woman tree a

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,830
transformer hey would you like to

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,170
introduce yourself thank you at Alma's

00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,789
my name is Julia transformer I'm

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,000
self-employed I'm based in the

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,680
netherlands amongst other things I work

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,230
as a programmer also has a business

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,019
consultant i'm a member of fur PHP women

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,770
and I very much would like more women to

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:38,280
join the industry you've had two

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,649
sessions here in Munich one of them we

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,200
had a talk on sunday and was very

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,030
interesting because you said on PHP

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,340
conferences you going to talk about

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,460
WordPress and on the press conference

00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:53,430
you're going to talk about PHP and you

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:59,100
said that PHP developers should learn

00:00:53,430 --> 00:01:01,710
more from WordPress why us if you

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,290
realize that twenty percent of websites

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,020
currently run websites or web sites

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,780
worldwide run on wordpress we have

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:12,570
something to learn because there is a

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,909
message there mean it's if it's so easy

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,799
to install it runs everywhere then

00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,619
they're doing something right and the

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,170
code may not be the prettiest but the

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,520
whole thing about usability the way they

00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:29,040
make it easy for people to use that make

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,540
it very well-known project I think we

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,119
definitely have something to learn I

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,540
don't know other projects who have the

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:42,930
ability to be so big or especially any

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:46,290
any other PHP project I'm probably not

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,140
the best person to judge that but if you

00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,659
look at the complete field work zend

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,920
framework and symphony both are making a

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:58,619
big splash as back and frameworks and in

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,250
I don't know the figures of how many

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:04,770
websites are run on you know with a back

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,170
end of a symphony or zend framework but

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,360
I do think they are definitely having an

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,910
impact on the industry as well your

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,180
second session was about utf-8 and the

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,420
problems you

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,980
ran into so what are the main problems

00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:24,010
of utf8 the main problem is actually

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,349
really simple to explain everything and

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:31,480
I mean literally everything defaults to

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:34,150
eat a Latin or a ski and that's it

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,799
that's the whole misery of beauty of

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:42,129
eight and its problems I would

00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:44,170
definitely say so yeah big but the thing

00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:48,629
is if everything defaults to let in or a

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:51,669
ski if you don't explicitly tell the

00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:55,599
whole you know the whole cadence the

00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:58,599
whole range of things you used to use UT

00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,400
of aids if one of them you still use is

00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,219
Latin your data mate might become

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,669
corrupt so you really have to be

00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:10,510
explicit everywhere and that's the only

00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,340
problem but and then the problem people

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,079
run into is that they don't realize that

00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,239
everywhere is actually a lot more places

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:19,239
than they first think one of the

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,180
examples I would say of something which

00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:25,629
is often forgotten is for instance your

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,989
FTP connection most people would ftp all

00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:31,659
their files and use the ftp program

00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:34,750
default but like HTML files by default

00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:37,329
will be sent over as ascii if you use a

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:39,189
utf-8 characters in your HTML file

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:40,930
they're all there easily can become

00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:45,250
corrupt you have to send them over as

00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:51,340
binary this explains some issues i had

00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:53,500
ok but it's another ok so why do you

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:56,829
have to deal with these problems or why

00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:01,509
what was your reason to to deal with

00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:03,699
these problems the reason i actually

00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:06,280
learned a very beauty fades and actually

00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:09,430
made every single mistake i tell about

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,739
myself is because i'm the worldwide

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,959
project leader of a protocol to remember

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,049
me when I'm gone remember me when I'm

00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:19,959
gone is worldwide a project for memory

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:22,180
books where we try to inspire and

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,580
motivate parents who think or believe

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,660
they might die young to make a memory

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,090
book for

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,220
every child's so the child can later now

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,910
in the words of the parents would

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:36,010
apparent wealth and that project is as

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,410
its worldwide we try to make the boot

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:41,980
the basic booklet available in as many

00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:43,360
languages as possible and obviously

00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,160
you've run into problems with scripts

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,960
but there are so many communities

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,150
there's not only the PHP community

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,740
there's not only the WordPress community

00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,260
they've got the the type of community

00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:58,060
the joomla community the same framework

00:04:53,260 --> 00:05:02,470
communities Symphony community this is a

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:05,320
problem isn't it I wouldn't so much call

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,110
it a problem but I would radically the

00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,940
challenge I think it's a bit silly

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:13,180
having all these different communities I

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,070
think all these communities learned from

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,760
it I could learn from each other they

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:21,640
all use PHP so one of the things I try

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:23,770
to do is cross contaminate I've spoken

00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,660
about UT of a tad human a conference

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,270
I've spoken bear to you today to add a

00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,420
big word press conference I spoke about

00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:34,180
WordPress at bhp conference I I'd like

00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,920
to try and build some breeches and I

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,170
would very much like it if more people

00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,120
will try and do that trying and mix

00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,010
communities and make people in other

00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,840
communities aware of the fact that

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:48,220
there's more communities than just their

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,980
own to be honest is it necessary to deal

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:53,680
with the PHP core anymore because if I'm

00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:57,190
wordpress developer or if I'm a symphony

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,919
developer whatever I've got the tools

00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,600
that the framework provides or the

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,660
environment like wordpress or joomla

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:07,570
drupal so is it really necessary for me

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,940
as a developer to have a view on the

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:15,850
pitch p core or on the other communities

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:19,630
i believe so why i believe so because

00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:22,570
this still new things being attitude PHP

00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:26,800
and just to give a simple example 5.2

00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,169
gave us a filter extension and x 5.3 it

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,640
actually became really interesting

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,940
documentation is still a bit lacking but

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,050
a lot of though the bigger project

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,750
haven't implemented that yet because

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,550
they are cross-platform and they have a

00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,230
code base which has grown

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:44,740
over the years so it's an old code base

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:47,050
and it works but the filter extension

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,700
would work better and you still in your

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,460
own plugins for instance need to

00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,860
validate your data so it's very useful

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,870
to know about new developments in PHP

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:00,700
and where you can use them in your own

00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:03,670
projects speaking of code quality and

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,670
all this kind of stuff you mentioned

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:10,000
that WordPress itself the core is not

00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:13,300
really a good software so it's a good

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,420
and clean code base and secure and no

00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,430
not if a ver very well I think you miss

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,490
quoting me there a bit it's a secure

00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,610
code base I wouldn't say it's a clean

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,590
code base it's all software in other

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,360
words it's grown over the times and

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,730
there's large parts which are being

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,520
completely refactored and really are

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:35,950
becoming clean good codes there's also

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,190
still large part which aren't good clean

00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,920
code but it is secure and any security

00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:45,550
issues detected with WordPress call are

00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,590
solved within no time the really very

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,540
conscious of security and WordPress core

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,030
is secure unlike what most people think

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:55,270
the problem with security with WordPress

00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,430
is the teams and the plugins and again

00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,760
the problem there is that a lot of

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:03,490
people that the the actual starting

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,820
point for starting with PHP is is it's

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:09,160
it's easy to start and people start

00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,830
their four and then don't really know

00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:14,260
what they're doing in PHP and release a

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:17,460
plugin and their code will not be secure

00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:19,840
the code might actually not be any good

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,430
but those plugins do make it into

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,980
plug-in repository and people will

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,690
download and they use it and that's

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,610
where your problem start as you

00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,610
mentioned before you're part of a peach

00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:34,450
p women can you tell us something about

00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:37,750
this organization of course more than

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:40,500
welcome PHP women is a non-profit

00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,420
initiative for both men and women and

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,490
one of the major aims for PHP women is

00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:47,920
to lower the barriers for women to enter

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,490
the industry I remember the first time I

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,230
went to a conference I felt either

00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,030
completely ignored

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,340
all like people were looking at me as if

00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,080
I were an alien and that's not very

00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,060
comfortable and I know it's getting

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:03,850
better and it depends on which community

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:06,580
you're in some conferences are better

00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:09,100
than others in that respect but it's

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,600
important i think all together it's

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,180
important that there's more women

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,240
entering this industry i sing the code

00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:19,080
will actually vote in quality and in

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,760
total quantity also improve if we have a

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:25,150
larger group and a more diverse group of

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,390
people contributing to it so let's

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:31,510
welcome women so what can I do as a man

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:35,710
or what can every women out there can do

00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:37,540
to join or to support you first of all

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,790

connects which is organized by PHP women

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:58,380
the major difference between most other

00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,600
conference and this conference is that

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,950
toilet technical talk and then work life

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,870
balance talk technical talk word life

00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:10,450
balance so it's it's a different

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:13,690
atmosphere created just by the choice of

00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:17,080
