Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2013
Description: 
	Bei der Nutzung von Technologien, Tools und Programmressourcen sollte man sich generell erst einmal dar端ber im Klaren sein, was eigentlich die Projektziele sind und welches Budget daf端r zur Verf端gung steht. Und genauso gilt das f端r den Mobile-Bereich, wie Luca Passsani, WURFL-Entwickler und CTO bei ScientiaMobile, bei der ersten IPC-Keynote "If Responsive Web Design is the Answer, what was the Question?" einmal aufzeigte.

Thank You Sebastian II can you guys hear

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,750
me so who has heard about warfel before

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,570
here please raise your hand okay so I

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:27,449
say about fifteen twenty percent that's

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:30,510
good so let me let me in your opinion

00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,210
what's the most important book in the

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,160
history of computer science maybe one of

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,890
this I'm sure that if you have been to

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,649
college you have come across I have come

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,559
across one or more of these books or or

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:45,890
maybe this so I imagine that if you are

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,090
here you probably have heard about

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,850
responsive web design before they say oh

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,620
wow this is so game-changing this is the

00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,620
the most important book in the history

00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,320
of computer science to me the most

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,390
important book for math in my

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,340
professional life in computer science is

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,350
this one which is not which is not a

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,320
computer science book but it's a book

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,900
that you know it's about economics and

00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,439
the fact that economics is the study of

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,180
incentives which is what pushes people

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,939
to do their job where to do their job

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,490
right so I switch between windows and

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,070
ubuntu for as a you know have dual boot

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,049
of my laptop and one thing that bugs me

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,670
about the boon to is that skype is not

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,400
so good so it works but you know

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,140
sometimes it crashes it's totally random

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,240
whether i managed to share my screen or

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,369
not and they were like oh wait a

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,070
mattress on fixing why isn't microsoft

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,649
fixing this and as soon as asked myself

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,729
the question i had the answer because

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:47,040
microsoft is not particularly interested

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:49,649
in making a boon to a better platform

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,009
now this is my user perspective of

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,869
course but if if i put myself in the

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,119
shoes of the guy at microsoft you know

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,659
is a pro-german a product manager and

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,689
and of course doing the boon to write is

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:10,379
probably not only is on his priority

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:13,650
list now if in my job as a product

00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:15,420
manager and in all of my previous jobs

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:17,970
where I was a consultant where I was

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,950
part of a bigger team and I'm sure that

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,500
the situation is the same for you you

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,540
have to ask yourself what is it I want

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,459
to achieve where what resources do I

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,930
have where do I want to employ those

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:34,620
resources to get maximum effect maximum

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:37,379
bank for your box so to speak and in

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:42,209
computer science as developers we often

00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:44,459
we are we're often captive of picking a

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,200
technology for technology's sake so you

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,569
are you're a front-end developers oh

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,030
these days angularjs well cool let me

00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:54,079
see if I can convince the project

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,120
manager to use that technology so it's a

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:59,459
so I will learn a new thing and someone

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
else we pay the bill now don't take me

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,930
wrong for that but I mean it's a I don't

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,220
know much about angularjs I'm sure it

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,139
says it's a good i will just around an

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,389
example that came up in my mind but I

00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:13,530
mean a lot of times we as developers we

00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:16,470
are driven by the cool factor but as we

00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:17,970
grow up once we turn 35 or 40 and then

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,790
we're more in charge we are in charge of

00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:22,669
keeping a project on track then we also

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:26,430
need to be able to take a step back and

00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,470
and avoid the choosing technology for

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,569
technology's sake but rather make

00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:33,510
decision based on facts and based on

00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,889
understanding of the resources of the

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,310
skill of the people that work on the

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:43,079
projects and a variety of other factors

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:46,440
so it's obvious they're responsive web

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,329
design is a great momentum here but the

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,489
point that I would like you to walk away

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:54,030
with when you want to leave this keynote

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:58,079
is what aspects are there to be

00:03:54,030 --> 00:04:00,569
considered when when you go when you

00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,579
have to start a mobile web project which

00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,010
is typically mobilizing an existing web

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,650
offer so that you can it can be used

00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,169
across devices and across everything

00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,329
that is internet-enabled I have a list

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,000
here but I will go through each and

00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:18,299
every of these of these points one by

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,190
one so this is the musical mobile

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:24,870
contest and mythical as a question mark

00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:27,810
I've been doing mobile development since

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:31,710
to the web times in 99

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:33,240
and at the time it was absolutely no

00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,750
doubt that something called the mobile

00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:38,790
context existed because the browser was

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,960
so crippled the screens were so small

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:45,780
the the bandwidth was so limited and the

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,760
latency was so bad that to do anything

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,139
meaningful you just had to say okay this

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,419
is not the web this is something else

00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:53,010
yes there is HTTP but you know that's

00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,610
pretty much the only thing there because

00:04:53,010 --> 00:05:02,729
a lot of things have to be have to be

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:05,639
reinvented this went as far as claiming

00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,590
in you know teaching and doing in

00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,090
project something that I would call the

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,690
tail wagging the dog you know it's

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,910
usually it's the dog that ways that the

00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,919
wax the tail here it's a it was the

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:21,180
other way around so the concept is

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:22,740
basically in computer science every

00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,200
programmer is total that you have your

00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,540
data then you have your your business

00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,550
logic of business intelligence and then

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,890
there is the front end which is a more

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,320
or less something that can change you

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,660
know just let the designers in the in

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,479
the other room figure out the front end

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,260
so when in the very beginning of mobile

00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,570
development the usability was so

00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:48,990
important you have to really squeeze the

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:52,289
last drop of usability out of of your

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,970
application that walking back and going

00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:56,729
all the way back to the business logic

00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:00,000
to have a mobile application that made

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:02,070
sense it was plausible I mean not that

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,479
you necessarily have to do it but there

00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,490
were cases where you say you know what

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,380
the way we did things on the web so far

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,440
they're not going to cut it by just

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,270
attaching a web or mobile interface on

00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:15,560
top of it we really need to rethink a

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,479
lot of a lot of the previous assumptions

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,250
arguably today this is not necessary

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,080
anymore because the mobile devices have

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,910
improved and you know with things like

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,060
responsive you're more at the level

00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:29,520
where you can consider more or less your

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,410
mobile application just like one you

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,300
view of your of your web offering but

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,729
still I wouldn't go as far as saying

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,039
that the mobile context that does not

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:41,460
exist anymore and the very fact that

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,470
people

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,900
use the responsive web design the fact

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,830
that hundreds of thousands of companies

00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,900
actually are delivering apps for their

00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:55,919
services this is the example of the fact

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,319
that mobile context exists of course the

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,240
latest fad is to say oh there is no

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,130
mobile context anymore yes it's true

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,380
people have Wi-Fi people browse the web

00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:07,800
on the couch but there is still a mobile

00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,919
context and of course and this has been

00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,720
covered pretty well by a speaker this

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:18,479
morning Sven vol 4 man you know there is

00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,430
also an issue with how hub what the

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,349
payload of the page how big is the page

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,139
and the fact that if your pages two

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:28,830
megabytes that's not going to be a good

00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:33,570
mobile page because it's a people will

00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:36,960
be what won't be there for you now the

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:38,970
second the second important aspect that

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,370
in my opinion is being disregarded but

00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:44,460
it's really important is what i call the

00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,550
burden of failure so let's say that you

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,979
have a mobile web offering you have a

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,229
side to that you think works in mobile

00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:54,960
and then one day someone test you look

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:57,150
this is a user is complaining that our

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,270
site isn't working on their device they

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,180
have a nokia n8 just random device which

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,490
which was a which is arguably could even

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,169
be considered a smartphone and but I

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,000
discovered that the you order your site

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,219
doesn't work so what do you do there you

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,259
tell the user to change the phone you

00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:15,900
just ignore the problem and hope that

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,800
the guy upgrades is a 22 to another

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,150
device and the problem solves itself or

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,639
you call your engineering team assay

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,009
guys this is a bug we need to fix it so

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,259
this is what I call the burden of

00:08:26,009 --> 00:08:30,960
failure the fact that you as a content

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:33,719
provider decide for business reasons

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:38,250
that you want to take on yourself the

00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,990
problem the cost of 6 in the user

00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,029
experience for all devices out there or

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,539
at least for a well-defined set of

00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:44,539
devices

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:53,490
there are a lot of devices of there and

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:55,050
so when you say oh let's support less

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,330
support mobile these needs to be

00:08:55,050 --> 00:09:00,720
qualified a little bit more so someone

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:03,270
may say you know what tablets yes that's

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,760
not so very different from from the web

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:08,160
so it's a it could be an S yeah you know

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,810
it's of course we can go on and discuss

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,220
about it how in fact the tablet is

00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,290
different from the regular web but you

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,020
know it's usually not as expensive to

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:18,150
support the tablet smartphone so yes

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,560
that's when you want to go mobile and

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,780
you certainly want to support those

00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,390
smartphones then you throw feature

00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:27,720
phones into the picture and yes it would

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,980
be nice not to discriminate among your

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,450
custom and say oh you have to get a

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,850
better device and it would be nice to

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,640
support the long tail of legacy devices

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,560
of course the deaths when the cost has

00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,810
to be considered an factoring and how

00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,200
you plan for your project then of course

00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:46,830
there is a whole new wave of

00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,210
internet-enabled devices smart TVs xbox

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,140
and playstation going on the internet

00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:54,030
and now Google glasses and you know

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:58,050
wristwatches it was in one of the

00:09:54,030 --> 00:10:00,030
presentation this morning and it's the

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,700
supporting all this stuff it doesn't

00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,410
come for free it's it's certainly you

00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:05,940
need to have a strategy and to have a

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,730
way to address the different classes of

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,670
devices and intact when something

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,070
doesn't go according to plans hello

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:18,030
another use cases which admittedly is

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:21,900
not the most common one is a granularity

00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:25,050
of client detection so typically most

00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,960
most people won't need to address the

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:29,910
single devices but if you do then all of

00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,530
a sudden it's a bigger problem you need

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,840
something called the devices crucial

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:36,180
repository which is a way to map your

00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:40,800
HTTP request to the profile of the

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:43,020
actual device you know ad networks and

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,170
the e-commerce site the in fact may need

00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:51,230
a component like this now URL uniqueness

00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:56,630
I'm sure that many of you have seen this

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,630
these three dis comic strip before and

00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,340
okay I read it hi I'm

00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,230
server who are you I'm a browser I'd

00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:06,180
like to see this article oh boy I can

00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:09,150
help let me get it for oh wow you're a

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,340
smart phone browser yeah cool I got this

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:14,520
new mobile version of my sight check it

00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:16,470
out isn't it pretty sure but this is

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,540
just your mobile sites main page what is

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:22,520
the article I wanted what article the

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:25,020
one I who are you I am the service so if

00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,460
and you know I'm sure that in your life

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,520
you have come across this you know where

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:31,470
where the moment where a content

00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:35,280
provider just created separated

00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:38,690
experience and they didn't provide a

00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,310
mirroring of the content on that side so

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:44,580
to me this is the problem of URL

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:47,220
uniqueness so you want the URL to your

00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,710
content to be honored on each and every

00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,440
device that your application or your

00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:57,960
your web service is supposed to do

00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:00,210
service of course if you want your L

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:02,640
uniqueness this is something that you

00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,400
should account for in the beginning so

00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,600
that you're not caught by surprise

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,880
halfway through the project when you say

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,650
you know what where is this assumption

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,530
where we don't need you URL uniqueness

00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:18,540
is really poor because we do need it and

00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:22,050
okay this is a in fact about what I was

00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,850
telling earlier about the the tail

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,390
wagging the dog so how far back you

00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:30,090
should go in revisiting your not only

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:32,160
your front end but also your back end

00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:35,960
and your business intelligent in order

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,910
to support a great mobile experience and

00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:42,570
this is one of the aspects that you need

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:47,040
to carefully consider in when planning

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:49,050
for your your mobile application and

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,910
then also the cost of maintenance I mean

00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,940
on the web we're more or less used to

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,980
creating a website and it will keep

00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,660
going for quite some time without us

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:00,840
needing to touch the JavaScript of the

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:04,200
CSS typically mobile things are not

00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,180
quite like that because if a new iOS

00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,850
version comes along and it doesn't work

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,460
that that does send the shivers down the

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:12,960
company spine with with the vice

00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,529
president say oh I got this phone and

00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,680
our

00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:19,769
our website sucks so it's it's something

00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,709
you need to take into consideration now

00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:24,449
these are these where the aspects that

00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:27,240
to me are the most important i'm sure

00:13:24,449 --> 00:13:29,610
that i forgot some and i'll be happy to

00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,959
take up to take discussions later today

00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:36,360
about this but let me let me have let me

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,490
go through the common strategies to

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,269
create mobile sites so that we can see

00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,829
how the two things intermix again i will

00:13:42,269 --> 00:13:47,670
go through and dish every one of these

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:50,129
strategies the benchmark for mobile

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,949
today in my opinion is do nothing

00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:54,180
because if you say you know what only

00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:58,350
care about tablets and smartphones

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:01,790
people can zoom and pan and then a

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:06,050
regular website could be considered an

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:09,120
approximation of a mobile site beware of

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,579
flesh because flesh will break on the

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,279
ice on the iOS and also on a recent

00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:17,129
versions of android just to be fair to

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,050
CNN they do have a mobile user

00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:23,100
experience but i just like the fact that

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:25,680
was a great example of pan and zoom the

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:28,980
second approach which admittedly is a

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,519
bit yesterday is the one of having a

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:36,720
software component called the transcoder

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,759
the transcoder will basically request

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,279
the web pages on behalf of the mobile

00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:47,939
user and reshuffle the content so that

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:49,199
it's more is more mobile aware and there

00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:51,870
are a lot of different variations to

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,209
this approach the main advantage being

00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,850
the fact that you are you have a company

00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:59,550
with a website that requires a lot of

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:01,949
effort to change so you can fix mobile

00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:04,529
by throw in an extra component at it as

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:08,699
as opposed to disrupting what you

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:14,069
already have in place and as I said the

00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:15,660
strategy is a quick win MDOT website not

00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:18,300
exclusively but you know that's the

00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,429
death the most classical use you don't

00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,699
need to change what you what already

00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:25,679
works today fine tuning there is a

00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:26,819
little bit of a rubber band effect here

00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,479
because

00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:33,359
it's a you throw the transcoder at the

00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:34,649
problem and you go oh wow look I'm

00:15:33,359 --> 00:15:36,929
getting something that is mobile aware

00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,479
so let me improve on this and as you

00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:42,449
start improving you realize that the

00:15:39,479 --> 00:15:45,109
effort grows exponentially for every

00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:48,359
little change you want to do so it's a

00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:49,679
get to the point where it's not the gain

00:15:48,359 --> 00:15:52,410
may not be what you expected in the

00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:56,160
beginning it has to be frail because it

00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:58,739
sucks on the web offering you already

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,269
have so it could be that the webmaster

00:15:58,739 --> 00:16:02,519
totally independently changes to website

00:16:00,269 --> 00:16:05,459
and without realizing it's breaking your

00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,079
mobile site and then I just listed a few

00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:09,089
vendors there but there are more so

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,979
anyways I don't think it's at this point

00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:14,100
makes sense to spend too much time on

00:16:10,979 --> 00:16:15,660
transcoding the elephant in the room

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,779
which is not longer than elephant

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,419
because it's here and we we talk about

00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,579
it is responsive web design this was

00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:26,819
already presented this morning but then

00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:29,879
and I won't go into much detail about it

00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,889
i will just i would just mention the

00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,229
fact that it is in fact very powerful

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:36,899
because it allows to do the kind of the

00:16:34,229 --> 00:16:38,399
deputation directly on the on the client

00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,159
directly on the browser in the device

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,289
the kind of adaptation that earlier you

00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,639
could only do by leveraging the

00:16:43,289 --> 00:16:47,189
knowledge of the device on the server

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:54,029
and mostly serving different versions of

00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:57,749
your of your website so yet nothing new

00:16:54,029 --> 00:17:01,259
here just just showing how the media

00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:03,089
queries and the flexible grids come

00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,669
together to give you this very elastic

00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:10,589
and fluid website that adapts itself to

00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:12,299
to mobile now there are two important

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:13,970
aspects of responsive web design we

00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:16,709
should like to bring to your attention

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,289
let me read it for you but most

00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:21,000
importantly responsive web design is an

00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:23,429
intended to serve as a replacement for

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,980
the for mobile websites responsive

00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:27,839
design is I believe one part design

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,879
philosophy one part front-end

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,440
development strategy and there's a

00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:33,570
development strategy it's meant to be

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,029
evaluated to see if it meets the needs

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,769
of the project you are working on

00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:39,120
perhaps there is a compelling reason to

00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:40,320
keep your sights desktop mobile

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,179
experiences separate

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,070
it or perhaps your content will be

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,380
better served by responsive approach

00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:48,960
only you and your users know for certain

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,960
and this comes from instant market in

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,509
the book that introduced responsive web

00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,669
design to the world so even even if a

00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:58,919
market admitted that if your specific

00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:01,380
needs for mobile is not like responsive

00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:06,360
is necessarily the answer it it might be

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:09,289
or it might not be so bread frost is a

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,580
guy that if you have been following

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:13,370
responsive design you you will recognize

00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:16,980
bread as a god that is very active and

00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,509
gave a lot of interesting contributions

00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:23,549
to the responsive web design in general

00:18:18,509 --> 00:18:26,789
and he made the point strongly that for

00:18:23,549 --> 00:18:29,460
sure but it is correctly in my opinion I

00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:31,919
read it for you your visitors don't give

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,570
a if your site is responsive they

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,909
don't care if it's a separate mobile

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:38,580
site they don't care if it's just a

00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:40,710
plain old desktop site they do give a

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,320
 if they get done what they need to

00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,720
get done they do give a when your

00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,809
site takes 20 seconds to load they do

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:52,889
care when interactions are awkward and

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:54,389
broken so I don't think that anyone can

00:18:52,889 --> 00:18:56,789
object to this I mean at the end of the

00:18:54,389 --> 00:18:59,669
day we want to give the best possible

00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:01,740
user experience to our users and if the

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,529
responsive web design is the way cool if

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:09,419
it's not the way there are other ways to

00:19:04,529 --> 00:19:10,889
achieve the same result now so far it's

00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,860
very common in the industry to talk

00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:15,960
about responsive web design as one

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,850
single entity so it's like a binary

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:21,570
property Oh should i do responsive web

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:25,230
design or not to me if I look at it from

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:27,600
the perspective of a program a project

00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:29,700
manager and or a program manager that

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,009
needs to deliver product I like to split

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,169
it into two kinds of responsive web

00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:35,820
design one that I call don't touch me

00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:38,960
responsive web design which is

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:43,909
essentially reaching out on the internet

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,649
looking for ready-made hands-free

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,629
responsive web design templates buying

00:19:46,649 --> 00:19:51,629
them for fifteen or twenty or thirty

00:19:48,629 --> 00:19:52,830
dollars some are even free and you know

00:19:51,629 --> 00:19:54,029
you just need to know a little bit of

00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,969
HTML basically

00:19:54,029 --> 00:20:01,320
to fill in the blanks and mount your

00:19:56,969 --> 00:20:02,399
existing content on top of actually the

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,409
other way around the mountain your

00:20:02,399 --> 00:20:07,879
responsive template on top of your

00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:12,830
existing content and voila you have a

00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:18,389
decent responsive responsive website now

00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:20,789
is this is this awesome Alton say it's

00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:23,999
awesome and so here is an example from

00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:26,159
our experience we took one ready-made

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:29,879
responsive site a responsive template

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:33,210
excuse me and we realize one day that on

00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:36,679
the Nexus 7 once you're in landscape

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,940
mode the the man who really sucks and

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:41,039
unless you're really an expert in a

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,619
responsive web design it's not the

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,889
easiest thing to fix you know to go in

00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:48,119
understand where to change things how to

00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,700
be sure that you're not breaking

00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:54,359
something else if if you put your hands

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,419
in in a ready-made component so this is

00:20:54,359 --> 00:21:00,989
a shortcoming of don't touch me

00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,669
responsive web design then of course you

00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:05,219
have the custom-made responsive web

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:07,289
design where you do have this level of

00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:10,739
control but you have this level of

00:21:07,289 --> 00:21:13,379
control because you have hired or you

00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:17,190
have in your team someone that has a

00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:19,409
very deep and specific experience about

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,659
about all of the technologies that I

00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:25,529
mentioned there CSS media queries

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:27,690
jquery-ajax moderniser but really also

00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:31,109
specific experience in how to make all

00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,839
those things work together and the

00:21:31,109 --> 00:21:36,710
tweaks and hacks that are needed to to

00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,989
really have control of the platforms so

00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:42,690
the boston globe is is is a great

00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:47,969
example the site totally rocks it

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:50,789
totally be behaves nicely on all

00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:52,769
smartphones but it's if you look at the

00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:54,719
code it's really complex to stuff it's

00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,039
not like you'll do a tutorial and you

00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:58,649
know all of that stuff you really need

00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:01,200
someone with very specific experience

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:02,999
and so this is also an aspect that you

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,070
should consider when before you embark

00:22:02,999 --> 00:22:07,070
in in in a project

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:15,940
one approach that was pretty much the

00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:18,070
only approach until the two or three

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:21,840
years ago but you know which now is of

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:25,180
course less popular because of

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,090
responsive who is the one intervention

00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:30,430
before multi serving multi serving your

00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:34,210
user experience two different classes or

00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:37,270
even two single devices now a company

00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,160
like Facebook which of course has no

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:43,300
shortage of resources and skillful

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:46,630
engineers they do multi-server their

00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:49,570
m.facebook.com site so they will they

00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:51,490
will support anything from the open wave

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,740
62 browser that you really find on

00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:55,390
feature phones that even your grandma

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:57,520
wouldn't want to use this did is

00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:59,080
expensive but you know if if your

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,930
company is at the level where you need

00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,180
that kind of control then the multi

00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:06,220
serving is still the still the approach

00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,780
it's expensive but it's a it's a

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:14,170
superior approach in terms of control

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:15,490
you get finally the another what we

00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:18,580
could call the state of the art in

00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:21,580
mobile development is rest which is the

00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,880
union of the power of responsive web

00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:29,940
design and the ability to still have

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,940
some control server side by having a ddr

00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:37,030
give you the chance to find you and

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:40,060
adjust your your content so this is

00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:44,320
really about the burden of failure you

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:46,390
do a responsive web design side with we

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,070
server side detection and then when a

00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,950
customer comes along and says look this

00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:53,260
isn't working for me and you realize

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:55,570
that there are a bunch of CSS properties

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:59,500
or javascript events that are not

00:23:55,570 --> 00:24:01,480
supported you can single out the device

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,460
remove the offending parts and still

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,500
give a reasonable user experience to

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:10,210
that to the user to the user of that

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:12,550
device so this kind of control is is

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,880
what you want if you are a large company

00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:18,070
and you know could be a bank right so

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,480
you're a bank you're not an institution

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:20,490
but you are in a way because you don't

00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,590
want to go to your customers

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:26,280
look I don't I don't support your

00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:27,840
windows phone yeah it's a it's a you

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,660
need something more solid something that

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:35,250
gives you the level of control that

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:41,340
allows you to serve your customer in the

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:44,580
best possible way so rest is really a

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:48,929
very wide a very wide thing because it's

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:51,450
a primarily where s is the most obvious

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:55,140
use case is resizing the picture server

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:58,800
side so you diminish the payload of your

00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:02,550
of your mobile site but there are

00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:04,830
endless possibilities of using of using

00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:08,600
rests in a lot of other situation I'll

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:12,150
just take a couple from our own website

00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:15,120
you see the menu at the top there which

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:16,830
is the one that becomes an icon in the

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,620
top right corner there and will just

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,590
expand now this one will work really

00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:25,470
poorly on no smartphones or smartphones

00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:29,460
running opera meaning so thanks to rest

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:32,250
what we do is detecting those devices

00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:34,740
and just keep providing a pre expanded

00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,730
set of links and is as allowed us to

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:42,000
support devices that go all the way back

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:45,540
to 2005 so those devices we still be

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:49,260
able to access and and see the content

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:51,540
on our responsive rest website another

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,190
example and to me this is one of the

00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,340
weakest points of responsive web design

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,900
is if you have large tables now if you

00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,540
google for responsive web designer

00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,400
tables you find a boatload of people

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:07,470
that have different solutions for how to

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:09,990
to shuffle around your your tables with

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,580
Dom manipulation and CSS so that it look

00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:18,030
nicely now problem this table for us is

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:21,150
500 elements and if you did it

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,040
responsive you know people will be there

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,200
thinking that the page is loaded and

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:29,040
then the swipe and nothing happens the

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,470
great frustrated that's because the the

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,389
hardware is burning cycles and battery

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,119
trying to

00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:39,959
to reorganize that complex table with

00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:43,109
DOM and CSS so what we did we recognize

00:26:39,959 --> 00:26:47,249
no smartphones and we just give a

00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:51,089
different version of the table one that

00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:53,729
will is developed over two lines per

00:26:51,089 --> 00:26:55,649
line and we'll just load super fast

00:26:53,729 --> 00:26:57,659
because everything is pre-allocated and

00:26:55,649 --> 00:27:03,499
there is no need to manipulate anything

00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:06,779
and this 500 lines table will actually

00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:09,299
swipe and move back and forth a lot more

00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:11,309
easily than then a complex table that

00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:20,070
has been with a lot of CSS they need to

00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:24,809
be calculated and so on and so just to

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:26,219
wrap up I I I wanted to put the two

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:32,489
dimension of the things that describe

00:27:26,219 --> 00:27:34,889
together and so you have the aspects of

00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:39,779
mobile development on one side and at

00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:41,759
the top you have the different at the

00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:46,739
top you have the different strategies

00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:48,899
that I have described and I wrote down

00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:50,789
what in my opinion are the pros and cons

00:27:48,899 --> 00:27:55,919
you know the code the relative cost of

00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:58,529
each approach with each approach as

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,899
compared with with with the aspects that

00:27:58,529 --> 00:28:06,359
he needs to manage so they do nothing of

00:28:00,899 --> 00:28:08,940
course is is is read even non-applicable

00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,799
when it comes to mobile contest burden

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,690
of failure device classes support

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,909
plurality of device detection you're

00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,219
ignoring that so it has to be read of

00:28:14,909 --> 00:28:19,679
course what you get for free is your url

00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:21,239
uniqueness cost of integration is zero

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,679
because you're not doing anything more

00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:25,019
than your were already doing with the

00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,200
web and the same goes for cost of

00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:29,669
maintenance I mean nothing in addition

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,700
to the maintenance that you'll be doing

00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:35,399
normally when it comes to transcoding

00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,239
there is a lot of red and orange here

00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:41,070
you know this was arguably the most

00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:43,289
difficult column to make because there

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,020
are so many different solutions in that

00:28:43,289 --> 00:28:50,780
space that

00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:53,850
it's it's a you know if I if I took a

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,110
very strict n so it's like this someone

00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:57,390
else could come up with a counterexample

00:28:55,110 --> 00:29:00,060
anyway you know if you have little

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,740
control then it costs little but you

00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,630
don't have a lot of mobile contest if

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,580
you start having more mobile contents

00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:11,660
the more control then the cost goes up

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:13,950
and so it's a there is a little bit of

00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:16,230
contention there depending on which

00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,660
platform you choose oops the only thing

00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:21,690
I'd like to call out is that the cost of

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,490
integration tends to be low because you

00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:25,230
are not putting anything on top of your

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:27,480
existing infrastructure so you don't

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:32,090
need to rethink much of what you already

00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:34,770
have when it comes to don't touch me RWD

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,990
you get average mobile contest because

00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,630
our WV gives you mobile contest you

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:42,350
don't have super lot of control because

00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:45,060
you know what you get out of the box is

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,370
that's it you are not putting yourself

00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:50,070
in the position to to change things

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:53,370
unless you upgraded to the to the

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:56,340
custom-made RWD a burden of failure is

00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:58,380
totally on the user so if you said guys

00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,930
this is not working for me say I'm sorry

00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,550
wait for the next release and then you

00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:04,680
hope that this guy will get a new phone

00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,900
before the next village gun because it's

00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,340
not going to change anyway device

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,100
classes support I gave it a yellow

00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:13,830
because you may have some feature

00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,320
detection even though that's tends to go

00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:18,000
over to the custom made of course no

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,620
granularity of device detection so

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,320
responsive web design is not about

00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:28,260
recognizing you have a Lumia 920 or our

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:30,420
galaxy s4 or whatever so no no

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,340
granularity of device detection you get

00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,980
URL uniqueness free of charge of course

00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:38,040
because you're serving one URL and as

00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,020
people pass around the URL from desktop

00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:43,200
to smartphone to a feature phone to a

00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,120
tablet the user experience may change

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,180
but the content will be there for each

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:55,890
and every user cost of integration I

00:30:51,180 --> 00:31:00,000
gave it I gave it an orange because it's

00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:02,040
a you may still need

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,420
to go and change what if you think's in

00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,430
your front end and of course you know

00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,900
this is the things where you say oh what

00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:10,620
if at the confidence someone argues that

00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:12,240
these are that so it's a it's a I will

00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:17,610
be happy to take questions about this at

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,500
a later stage and the cost of cost of

00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,100
maintenance I'll say it's rather cheap

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,510
because you have this template and

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:26,040
chances are that if there is a bug maybe

00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,050
every two or three months you will get

00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,020
an update to the template and then you

00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:34,020
can you can piggyback your support

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,430
request on that so not a lot of not a

00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:38,310
lot of control but not that expensive

00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:40,530
expensive either so switching to custom

00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,300
made the responsive web design you have

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:44,580
feature detection which puts him one

00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:47,040
step ahead compared to the don't touch

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,780
me responsive web design burden of

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,990
failure is better that they don't touch

00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,700
me responsive web design because at this

00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,710
point you are someone who understands

00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:57,840
the intricacies of responsive web design

00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:00,810
and JavaScript and they can start

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,840
hacking and tweaking single problems and

00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:06,330
addressing those or for that device

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,570
possibly by doing some browser sniffing

00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:13,380
if if this is what it takes URL unique

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:17,100
uniqueness is still free of charge cost

00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,930
of integration I made it a slightly more

00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,150
expensive than the don't touch me

00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:23,640
responsive web design because you will

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:27,390
need a specialized resource here so it's

00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:30,290
not like you you know I don't think you

00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:33,780
can find a good responsive web design

00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:35,340
programmer around the corner and maybe

00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,740
in a few months that will be proven

00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,000
wrong but right now it's a good front

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:45,450
end developers are they tend to be rare

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,400
and cost of maintenance for the same

00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,390
reason is more expensive than the

00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:53,520
previous than the previous solution

00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:55,290
multi serve now multi-server yes we know

00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:58,100
that it's expensive but it's the

00:32:55,290 --> 00:33:01,530
quintessential mobile contest solution

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:04,230
multi-service like i want to have

00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:05,970
control I don't care about the price but

00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,250
give me a framework where I can really

00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:10,440
address families or single devices and

00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:12,810
have total control so I gave it a green

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,740
when it comes to mobile contest I gave

00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:15,630
it a green when you can

00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:17,250
the burden of failure I gave it a green

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,960
when it comes to device classes support

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,790
I gave it a green when it comes to

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,340
granularity of device detection you have

00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:26,100
ddr which is a database of devices

00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:31,559
support in your development at every

00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:34,260
stage of course things are less nice

00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,809
when it comes to your L uniqueness it's

00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,130
not impossible but to have your L

00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:40,650
uniqueness when you move to serve

00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:42,600
requires some extra work as a little

00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:44,490
aside the presentation would be given a

00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,740
five o'clock will give an example of how

00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:52,170
to handle these in a rest context and

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,940
yet cost of integration you need the

00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:55,950
device description repository which

00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,660
either you have a very simple one or a

00:33:55,950 --> 00:34:01,070
professional one will come with the cost

00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:05,010
plus you will have some costs in

00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:07,290
integrating and and deploying these

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,909
dissolution and you will also have a

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,070
cost when it comes to maintaining it

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:13,320
because new devices are coming out at

00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,720
all times and you need the to be in

00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,940
charge you need to be on top of the

00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:21,929
evolution of the of the device market

00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:24,570
now the ddr will will cover that for you

00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:28,139
to a large extent but still you need

00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:29,609
someone that will update the ddr or set

00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,570
up the mechanism to receive automatic

00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:36,540
updates and finally you have rest which

00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:41,790
is responsive web design plus several

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:45,480
side components and you have all the

00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:48,389
green of the most deserving i have i

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,220
have to take a little caveat here when

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:53,280
it comes to device classes support

00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:54,690
because if you're going back to you so

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,970
now i also want to support the legacy

00:34:54,690 --> 00:35:01,680
devices then things get more complicated

00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:03,480
also will press URL uniqueness comes

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,460
free of charge because you are still

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,530
under the umbrella of responsible design

00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:10,700
and of course you have the cost of

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:16,080
integration and cost of maintenance that

00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:17,609
that comes with with having to integrate

00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,170
and maintain a device description

00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:25,740
repository so i will continue with with

00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:27,060
my presentation a five o'clock here in

00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:31,200
the grocery sullen

00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:33,660
and I will go this will be more

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,700
developer oriented so but I would be

00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:37,920
happy to to continue that discussion

00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:40,200
there and the take question do we have

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,450
time for one question so what is the

00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,140
answer to your presentation oh it's the

00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:48,570
same answer as most of the questions

00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:51,870
that mankind the faces each and every

00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:56,400
day the rosales face it depends ah i see

00:35:51,870 --> 00:36:01,080
you it was short i don't know one more

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:04,500
question so thank you very much look

00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:06,560
I'll give my hand please thank you thank

00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,560
