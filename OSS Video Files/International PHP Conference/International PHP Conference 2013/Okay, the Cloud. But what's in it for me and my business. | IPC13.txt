Description: 
	Speakers Rainer Stropek (software architects gmbh), Frank MÃ¼ller (Canonical) and Glen Campell (Rackspace) joined the Keynote Panel at IPC 2013 to talk about the cloud and its opportunities for business cases. Who really needs the cloud? Is there just the one and only cloud or rather many different concepts of a cloud? This Panel is not about basics and propaganda, but about identifying business cases that are cloud-ready.
