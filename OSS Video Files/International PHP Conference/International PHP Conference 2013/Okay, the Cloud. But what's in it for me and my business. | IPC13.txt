Title: Okay, the Cloud. But what's in it for me and my business. | IPC13
Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2013
Description: 
	Speakers Rainer Stropek (software architects gmbh), Frank MÃ¼ller (Canonical) and Glen Campell (Rackspace) joined the Keynote Panel at IPC 2013 to talk about the cloud and its opportunities for business cases. Who really needs the cloud? Is there just the one and only cloud or rather many different concepts of a cloud? This Panel is not about basics and propaganda, but about identifying business cases that are cloud-ready.

the cloud story is around let's say for

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,160
almost a half a decade now and it's

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,809
again the industry which says you need

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,660
to go to the cloud and the cloud is the

00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:22,199
big new thing and well we've heard that

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,480
stuff quite often in the past and we are

00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,330
all a little skeptical we say okay blah

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,609
blah that's the big story who really

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,230
needs the cloud and we would say it okay

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,590
now we want to sit down with with some

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,070
experts and speak about what the cloud

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:41,100
can mean already today to developers to

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,350
ops to businesses and the important

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,410
thing is which I said okay we want to

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,840
nail down not we would we don't want to

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:52,289
speak about the basics yeah we don't

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,719
want to speak about the cloud propaganda

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,329
we really want to sit down and find out

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,239
okay where can we identify some cases

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,770
where the cloud really matters and of

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,019
course it's about many many different

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,659
cloud technologies in the end is the

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,280
question is there one cloud or do we

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,570
more speak about let's say cloud

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,119
concepts and plural and so that's it's

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,330
all about and of course I prepare to a

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,119
few questions and which we are going to

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,740
discuss right here on stage but if you

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,479
also want to contribute to the

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,880
conversation and if you also want to ask

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:30,240
a question please please raise your hand

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,409
yeah and I think there is a microphone

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,329
yes yes and then please join the

00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:38,579
conversation just raise your hand and

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:40,829
tell us that you'd like also to say

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,240
something or that you would like to ask

00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,939
a question okay so now I'd like to call

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,560
up on stage Glen Campbell from rackspace

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:51,560
please welcome him

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,360
secondly franck muller from canonical

00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,700
he's working on some Ubuntu systems he's

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,619
a cop he is just explaining it a little

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,619
bit more exact to us in a few minutes

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,350
and last but not least by Nash tropic he

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,209
is working on with Microsoft

00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:19,420
technologies and can tell us a little

00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:20,880
bit and he's really doing one hundred

00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,530
percent or ninety nine percent

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,060
cloud-based business that's really

00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:27,060
interesting so please welcome right now

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,530
so now this was a little interest in

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,180
true for my side but i feel it's much

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,250
better that you guys going to introduce

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,310
yourselves a little bit and please

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,769
explain the audience also a little

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,100
what's your approach towards the cloud

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:47,380
maybe blend your starting sure I work

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,150
for rackspace Rackspace if you're not

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,010
aware is the the second-largest cloud

00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:56,500
provider on the earth after amazon we're

00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:59,200
an infrastructure provider so we offer

00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,299
cloud servers cloud storage cloud

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,600
databases and all the things from which

00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:06,370
you can build your application and we're

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,650
working very closely with the OpenStack

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,870
foundation which has an open source

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,100
cloud management software that we're

00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:15,250
going to run your own cloud you can go

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:17,320
download it and run it yourself we're

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,890
sort of working up the stack we used to

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:23,170
be a dedicated hosting provider and see

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,730
the cloud really has the future that we

00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:31,239
still have the dedicated hosting as well

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:36,130
thanks Frank yes many of you already

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:38,680
know canonical from ubuntu used as

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:41,079
desktop operating system or as serve

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,180
operating system but we are also

00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,970
developing other open-source products

00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,150
and one of them is to do that's product

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:52,810
the team where I'm working on is

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:57,700
developing and this is a software this

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:59,819
is the idea of yes provided more simple

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,030
provisioning of server infrastructures

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:06,780
independent of the underlying

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:10,300
infrastructure provider so if you use

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,090
Rackspace amazeen if you use any other

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,479
OpenStack provider the software juju

00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:18,549
helps to provide services in pre

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:23,950
configured yet we call them charms on

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:25,660
these systems Thanks I know Thank You

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,760
Sebastian emanates rhinos tropic

00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,040
compared to the to my other two

00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,830
colleagues my company is really small I

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,260
run my own business it's a small company

00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:37,870
we're just a bunch of guys running

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,360
software as a service in the cloud we

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,020
founded our company a few years ago with

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,330
the express purpose of using and living

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,160
and breathing and building software in

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,900
the cloud software as a service with one

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,690
flagship product which is called time

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,910
cockpit and we also build and help other

00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:57,280
companies and teams to get their

00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,380
software in the cloud and I am a one

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,130
hundred percent platform as a service

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:06,490
guy so I spent enough time of my life in

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,110
dark cellars installing servers and I

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,820
don't want to do that anymore I don't

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,620
want to care about the infrastructure I

00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,840
just want a platform and deploy my

00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,460
applications they're great thank you

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,470
very much so maybe we ask the audience

00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,660
just to understand or just so that you

00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,690
can also introduce yourself to us yeah

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,690
so maybe please raise your hand who has

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:31,200
already let's say experimented with some

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:35,500
cloud technology whatever it is is okay

00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:42,090
who has already built or builds a system

00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:46,300
which is running in the cloud so really

00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:48,550
okay and who he has already built many

00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:52,660
systems running in the cloud like I know

00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:59,950
for example okay fine as the only pure

00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:02,610
guy okay we're with you so let's start

00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:05,099
about speaking about

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,919
well the cloud because in your session

00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:09,629
you said okay all the presentations

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,340
about the cloud start with the photo of

00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:15,750
the cloud and we see something very

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,849
fuzzy maybe we can sort the field a

00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:21,629
little bit so for example you guys at

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:23,150
Rackspace and you are the key sponsor

00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:27,030
right for the open source framework

00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,949
OpenStack this is more infrastructure as

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,289
a service maybe you can explain a little

00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:34,500
bit more what exactly does it mean so

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:37,199
the OpenStack Foundation started as a

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:38,610
joint venture between NASA the Space

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,460
Administration in the US and and

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,159
Rackspace Rackspace contributed what

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:46,620
became known as cloud files or OpenStack

00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:49,169
Swift which is an object storage in the

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,300
cloud and NASA contributed something

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,460
called Nova which was their internal

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,469
compute management so starting from

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,569
those two the OpenStack foundation then

00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:59,819
added various other types of

00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:03,389
infrastructure as a service load

00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:05,250
balancers databases and they're moving

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,930
up the stack they recently announced a

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:10,409
project called solum which essentially

00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:12,779
is a platform level abstraction as well

00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:14,550
but I think the key there is that these

00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,500
are all infrastructure components that

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:19,710
are provided via a web service there's

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,259
an API that you can call and create a

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,240
serval using virtualization so you

00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:27,029
specify how big a server you want what

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,650
operating system flavor you need and it

00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,750
goes off and constructs that for you and

00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,310
handles the management of it the

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,250
technology i think is all pretty

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,509
standard it's just the fact that

00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,460
unifying the management of that across a

00:07:36,509 --> 00:07:40,319
huge number of actual physical servers

00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,639
is where the difficulty is and that's

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,490
one of the things that the OpenStack

00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:49,500
code tries to take out of the equation

00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:52,800
by making that open source so the cloud

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,810
is always about the idea of a service

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,750
and the service is all about the idea of

00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,279
I don't want to look behind so for

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,650
example if you go to a restaurant there

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,779
their new new fashionable restaurants

00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:05,310
you see the kitchen yeah which is kind

00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:06,810
of contradictory because normally I

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,669
don't want to see the kitchen I just

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,439
want to have a good service yeah but the

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:12,750
other and people like to look into the

00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,599
kitchen because of its looking nicely

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,380
and it's clean etc etc but coming back

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,420
it's

00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:20,700
all about I don't want to care about

00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:23,730
what's behind and especially even more

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:27,090
than that our customers don't don't care

00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:29,970
about infrastructure I want imitation I

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:32,910
don't want to have to unbox it cable it

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:34,320
fly edit and power pay for all that pay

00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:36,780
someone to management I just want to

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,300
serve her to use okay but suggestion it

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,570
is one thing that I don't want to care

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:45,210
about installing all this thing but I do

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,880
definitely care about what's going on

00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,520
behind the scenes so when I select a

00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,190
cloud platform and when I help customers

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:55,290
selecting a cloud platform we do look

00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:57,330
behind the scenes what are the service

00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,090
level agreements how professional do

00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:02,160
they act I visited one of Microsoft's

00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,410
cloud data centers and took a tour

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,330
around it and I have seen the

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:08,670
infrastructure and this is important for

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:11,190
me so not caring about infrastructure

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,830
does not mean I don't care how they

00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,870
handle my data it just means I don't

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,360
want to bother with installing all this

00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,250
stuff and keeping it alive like a small

00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,920
Tamagotchi living in the cloud that you

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:27,500
have to feed and breathe and all this

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:30,540
stuff I don't want to care about great

00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,940
the idea of the cloud is also associated

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,790
to let's say the idea of infinite

00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:39,930
resources is this true doesn't it make

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:42,270
sense you know no it can look like that

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,500
because the goal is to make an interface

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,840
that looks like there's infinite

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,860
resources and in fact there never is you

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,880
know there's always a finite amount

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:55,050
beyond there and so for most people it

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,340
is virtually infinitely expandable in

00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,050
other words they'll actually run out of

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,090
room on their credit card before they'll

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,800
run out of compute storage that they can

00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:03,120
get their hit some other limit but

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,290
there's always a finite limit there

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,700
there's a there's a fixed number of

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,710
physical servers you can put in a data

00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,250
center and and you're going to hit that

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,960
at some point that's definitely true I

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,300
think that's an important point that

00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,550
people who are really serious about the

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,680
cloud have to think of they need some

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,840
kind of contracts with cloud vendors

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,460
that guarantees them resources to a

00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,740
certain degree it's like in this hotel

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,390
if you step in at ten o'clock in the

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,760
evening and you say i need a hotel room

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,360
it may happen to you that they don't

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,220
have one

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,839
so you need to have a reservation and

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,390
it's the same for all the cloud

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,089
providers so to a certain degree you're

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:42,450
just exchanging hardware sitting on

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:45,450
stock in your back room with contracts

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,670
it is a little bit of fixed costs but to

00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,610
a certain degree you will also need it

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:52,470
if even if you go to the cloud and you

00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:56,250
have this variable price model so if

00:10:52,470 --> 00:11:00,050
serious you need some contracts but it's

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:03,180
indeed more flexible then then having an

00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:07,079
old-fashioned case giving dourin taking

00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:11,160
your model you don't have to rent own

00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:14,730
building in the city you want to take a

00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,550
night you go into a hotel so there are

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:21,660
some cloud providers do provide a

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:24,540
contingent of infrastructure to you and

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,570
yes you have to rent it for night off on

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,130
someone it as this is mainly a

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:31,680
development conference and not an

00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,079
operations conference I'd like to send

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,180
early understand a little bit more what

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,470
impact to cloud technologies have on

00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:43,649
software development or software

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,560
engineering today and or in the past

00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:49,110
what do you guys think so the code in

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,050
the end it's it's all about well if I

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,480
develops if I'm developing a system

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:57,390
today and I don't care about where it's

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,730
running I won't care tomorrow if it's a

00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:03,089
cloud yes or not the question is now do

00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:07,550
we do the same or do certain parameters

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:13,290
change our work and how we build systems

00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:16,260
it definitely changed the where when the

00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:19,320
past the typical system administrator

00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,860
has to care for the limits of a physical

00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:25,199
machine of a number of physical machines

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,779
the understanding is now moving into how

00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:29,790
clouds of working out loud

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,510
infrastructures are working how for

00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,579
example choosing the right region of

00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,580
Amazon infrastructures or regions are

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:40,940
working so the

00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:46,930
has influences on the latency of the

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:49,160
data flow and so the administrator yes

00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:51,590
will not be the address traitor as it

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,170
has been in the past we are talking

00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,450
about DevOps here it is he's moving

00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:59,600
closer to the developers but he still

00:12:56,450 --> 00:13:01,610
has to have knowledge about the

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,760
infrastructure where the services are

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:07,190
running on but in terms of software

00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,880
development so for example we've spoken

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:13,010
about testability yeah I think one of

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,540
the interesting things that same a few

00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:17,720
months ago we started offering free

00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:20,180
accounts for open source projects one of

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,680
the unexpected side effects of that was

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,110
that a lot of these open source projects

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,090
are now available on Windows for the

00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:28,250
simple fact that before being a

00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,870
non-profit with no income and an open

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,880
source project they couldn't afford to

00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,200
buy a windows license but now that we're

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,510
giving the ability to spin up cloud

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,180
servers on demand running windows they

00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:41,330
can now offer their software on windows

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:43,130
and not be a Linux Pacific if you're a

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,140
developer it gives you the ability to

00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,460
call up different environments on demand

00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,870
so that you don't actually have to go

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,080
out and physically purchase those

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,250
machines to run it on and moreover you

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,380
don't have to keep those machines around

00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:56,150
if you're not using them so yeah it's um

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,800
if you have a six-month release cycle

00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,180
and you do integration testing the last

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,280
month of it well then you spin up your

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,780
servers for testing then you don't have

00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,660
to pay for them the other five months of

00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:07,550
the time from a developer's perspective

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,800
I think this is a very important point

00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:12,260
because the mind the the main gotcha

00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,760
that many developers have when they go

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,400
to the cloud is that they have to

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,410
remember that in the cloud the servers

00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:21,170
can change from one minute to the other

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:22,880
if you are in your own company you have

00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,950
the server and you build it up and it

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,620
will stay the same server for months

00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:30,290
even though maybe years but in the cloud

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,230
you deploy your software to a server you

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,600
scale it out to three servers and maybe

00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:38,240
the cloud provider decided to put this

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,980
one down and put the data or software or

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,020
your application to another server and

00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,450
your software has to handle that I

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,160
always tell developers that when they go

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:49,280
into the cloud they have to develop

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,990
software that is ready for scale out and

00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,060
not scale up

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,180
buying a bigger web server if you are

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,820
your site gets more more more traffic

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,950
it's not an option adding more servers

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,779
is the correct thing and I think we have

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,390
to keep that in mind as software do bus

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:08,240
and that changes some things that

00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:10,880
changes how we deal with state with data

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,890
and things like that yep the influence

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,430
on the architecture of your solution is

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:18,560
this immense it's it's distributed

00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,779
application and that's an absolute

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,330
difference from from the typical yeah

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:26,390
one request oriented in handling this

00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:28,760
request application like many web

00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,250
applications today are it's not

00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,930
synchronous anymore it's I have to use

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,700
other technologies like message queuing

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,080
and the cloud provides the

00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,260
infrastructure to run this other

00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,630
services depending on scaling out the

00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:46,160
the the notion which developers and

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:49,520
architects needs to care most well yes

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,860
and the other thing is latency I'm not

00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:54,860
building the next Facebook or the next

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,589
ebay so I build small to medium software

00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,570
and many teams that I know that have for

00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,579
instance performance problems with the

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,560
database and web server what do they do

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,060
they buy a bigger server they put the

00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,290
database and the web server on the same

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,089
machine so they don't have a network

00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:11,450
cable in between is and boom the

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:13,279
software is faster that worked for a lot

00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,990
of situations for small and medium

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,700
software developers but in the cloud

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:19,700
especially with platform as a service

00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,589
you can't install the database server on

00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,810
the web server because you can't access

00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:27,950
it so you have to keep that in mind I

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:31,360
always try the analogy of ikea when ikea

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:35,060
builds and you a new table they are not

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,820
starting with building the table they

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,980
are starting with calculating the the

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,310
economy behind it they are thinking how

00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:45,680
many how much money is it okay that this

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,450
table costs and how will people put it

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,480
together and things like that and then

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:52,640
they adapt the materials the production

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,829
process to what they want to build and

00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,320
if you go for platform as a service you

00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:59,390
don't think of an architecture and then

00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,459
try to map it to the platform services

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,560
you take a look at the platform services

00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:06,189
do the

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,319
math think about how can I smartly use

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:11,530
this service with this service and then

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:14,140
adapt your architecture to the platform

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:16,180
that you want to target and then things

00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,630
are paying off because you are really

00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:22,180
using the power of the platforms and

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:25,240
given the fact that as you said that

00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:29,260
setting up servers or infrastructures is

00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,860
much less complicated on a pass or even

00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,150
on infrastructure as a service level

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,010
couldn't it be that let's say

00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,070
architecture becomes much more let's say

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:41,220
experimental sure that that's that's one

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,360
of the cool things that I love is that

00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,040
architecture traditionally has been the

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,320
fixed part of the equation you decide

00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,330
what servers you had and you go purchase

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,560
them and and maybe purchasing more a few

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,270
years but you're stuck with what you

00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,960
have for that moment when you have

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:58,210
flexible elastic infrastructure you can

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,400
say let's try a different architecture

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,290
you can prototype things that involve an

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,840
utterly different arrangement there was

00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:07,360
a presentation yesterday on reversing

00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,440
your architecture and some discussion as

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,110
to whether or not that would work in

00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:12,820
various scenarios well with cloud you

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,280
spin it up you chest that you see if it

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,540
works it costs a few dollars it's not

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,400
like you have two major it make a major

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,410
capital investment to it suddenly you're

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,760
now prototyping architectures and not

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:26,920
just code exactly the way of simply

00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,010
create new configurations of different

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,820
services of different resources in your

00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:36,820
infrastructure scale it out really big

00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,290
for test purposes and then in the same

00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,670
moment if you say I don't need it

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,790
anymore destroy the whole environment

00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:45,730
this is yes a matter of some minutes so

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:48,250
how Kim bit more but it's a very small

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,890
amount of effort and and you don't have

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:53,650
to buy root huge racks and huge

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:56,679
infrastructures and keep them the whole

00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:01,929
year for your tests no just contested

00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:04,870
hmm I I can really support that because

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:07,840
recently one of our clients asked us

00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:10,570
whether our piece of software that we

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,580
have written is ready for 30 million

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,460
transactions business transactions per

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:16,290
month so i could have sit down and

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,210
calculate

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,430
and think about it and promise it but I

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,070
did the opposite I told him you know

00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:25,530
what let's try it let's spin up 20

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,770
machines in the cloud generate some test

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:31,410
data by a load generator also running in

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:35,220
the cloud fire these transactions to the

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:37,800
system and simply measure it it's that's

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,680
simply not possible in the cloud in this

00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,390
talk it's called what's in for me and my

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:45,360
business I would turn it around it's a

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,430
no-brainer I cannot imagine doing

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,830
business anymore without the cloud

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:52,020
because I couldn't do such things our

00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:54,330
competitors who are not using the cloud

00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,040
cannot offer this service to customers

00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,740
and I think it's really important to

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:04,730
have this ability to try as a nest and

00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,730
play it's even fun absolutely it's funny

00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:17,270
any question from the audience maybe no

00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,270
right speaking about arm operations

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,900
we've been now saying okay it's much

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,820
easier you know there's no need to

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:28,140
install something it's much easier to

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:31,980
setup something I have very often that

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,290
admin say Oh Emma does my employer meet

00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:39,510
me in the future if he's going to the

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:42,240
cloud probably yes but can you speak a

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,810
little bit about how the profile and the

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,430
skill set of let's say operation guys

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,800
should change what should they care

00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,230
about today in the future heating the

00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,780
cloud I I think it's one of those things

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,160
that matures over time the skills are

00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,980
still there but they're going to be used

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,510
in a different way if you are a poco

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,680
ball program or 20 years ago you can

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,660
make a lot of money but you couldn't

00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:05,970
expect to stay a cobol programmer

00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:09,150
forever you have to adapt and change

00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,490
likewise operations people are doing

00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:13,050
operations now they can't expect to sit

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,430
there and manipulate physical hardware

00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,740
they need to learn more about deployment

00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:18,270
tools they need to move more into the

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,010
programmable infrastructure end of

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,990
things and thus they're going to become

00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:25,020
more and more developer like we use the

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:27,240
term DevOps yes very commonly so there's

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,680
now a blurred line between that and so

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,540
the same people are there they're just

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,190
doing different

00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:34,500
scaling out brings different kinds of

00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,970
problems with it distributed

00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,550
applications bring different kind of

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:41,340
problems with it so the knowledge of the

00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:43,860
operators of the DevOps have to change

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,140
into this direction and has also to

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,390
support the developers in those areas

00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,210
because many developers still don't

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:53,160
don't really care for for topics like

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,100
like net splits and lag just large

00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:57,150
distributed applications and

00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,320
synchronization of states and here

00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:02,310
that's what you said in the preparation

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,110
handing state and the distributor

00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:07,340
distributed application is something

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:10,740
totally different than in old one box

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:13,200
applications I I have three points in

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,900
this area if you are an IT admin and you

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,420
want to stay an IT admin concentrate on

00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,690
networking because networking is super

00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:23,370
super important because your company has

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:26,550
to be connected to the cloud and

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:29,010
managing this in a in a reliable way

00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:31,710
it's a really complicated topic we will

00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:35,010
need IT admins for networking for a long

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:37,980
time second thing if you're an IT admin

00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:40,320
not working in the networking space you

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:42,480
should probably forget about walking

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,310
with the DVD to server installing an

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,110
operating system but concentrate on

00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,240
learning things like powershell and

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,860
things like that to spin up machines in

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,660
the cloud public or private doesn't

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,530
matter and the third one if you are a

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:58,380
developer learn about operations because

00:22:55,530 --> 00:23:01,170
in our company every developer is an

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,450
operational person every developer who

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,150
run who builds kind of service running

00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:08,340
in our case on Windows Azure has to know

00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:11,130
how to deploy the stuff and the

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,410
developer writes the PowerShell scripts

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:15,480
and deployment code and and build

00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,650
automation to deploy the stuff this is

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,270
DevOps so DevOps is not only moving

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:25,530
operation people to the Deaf world but

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:29,850
also making developers understand how IT

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:32,280
operations work keep this is maybe not

00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:35,190
entirely something you two to the

00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:37,110
typical web developers so maybe let's

00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:40,920
ask the audience them how many of you

00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,919
beyond the cloud now are developing and

00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:46,009
also let's say install

00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:49,519
and administrating web servers etc

00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:52,279
please Reggie on so this is already

00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:54,529
DevOps community right so so what what

00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:56,929
should they look on heading towards the

00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:59,090
cloud technology in specific should they

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:03,129
all use puppet and chef on all these

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:05,149
tools or what's what's in particular

00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:07,309
those are certainly the most popular

00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:10,489
ones the newer ones are ansible and salt

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:13,970
salt stack that are coming up the key is

00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:15,350
automation your we're moving away the

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,720
whole industry is moving away from

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:20,389
having expensive people working on one

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,980
server at a time doing manual tasks the

00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:25,509
goal is to automate everything so that

00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:30,590
you can streamline that yep exactly

00:24:25,509 --> 00:24:33,739
automation in clouds is this a new yes

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,749
it's the same as automation or not a

00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:40,369
single server but the technology is

00:24:35,749 --> 00:24:42,590
moving to chef puppet juju there are new

00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:44,720
technologies rising based on the

00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:46,970
experience the first adopters of cloud

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,399
technologies are now making and and this

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:54,609
grows more and more and so over time the

00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:58,220
knowledge has to move into this area too

00:24:54,609 --> 00:25:01,809
I'm microsoft guy in this in in this

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:05,239
panel so in the Microsoft world we see

00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:07,429
even even the next wave coming you see

00:25:05,239 --> 00:25:09,980
application lifetime management alm

00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:12,230
tools running in the cloud so recently

00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,480
I've been at a customer site where they

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,859
have a development team with 20 to 30

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,739
developers let's put it this way

00:25:15,859 --> 00:25:22,279
approximately and they want to build an

00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:24,799
an entire ALM stack with automated build

00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,600
work item management scrum and so on for

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:28,970
more than six months now and they

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,429
couldn't make it work just because

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,889
infrastructure didn't have the time to

00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,119
provide the necessary servers I went

00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:37,249
there I showed them Team Foundation

00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,190
services within 20 minutes we had

00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,989
everything up and running we had source

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,850
control we had work item management we

00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:46,190
had build servers and we fully

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,009
integrated continuous integration and

00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:50,539
deployment with platform-as-a-service

00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:52,970
services in the cloud so we just checked

00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:54,619
in our new website it was built in the

00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,359
cloud the tests were running in the

00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:56,750
cloud it was deployed to Windows Azure

00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:59,060
with

00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:02,000
could scale it up and we have never ever

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,560
even thought about a server iis or

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,470
things like that so I think an

00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,210
integrated system with LM at the

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,370
beginning continuous integration and

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,650
deployment and platform as a service in

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,900
the cloud is really something that small

00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:18,410
and medium teams should look at because

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,620
it reduces the their cost and it makes

00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:26,960
them super productive being having this

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:29,000
this little advantage in comparison to

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,310
maybe large competitors we're struggling

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,950
with infrastructures there's a bit of a

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,720
warning there too and that if some parts

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:37,160
of your company are getting involved in

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,800
this it can be very embarrassing if

00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,710
you're not when we were talking about

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,350
deploying our cloud our next-generation

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:46,940
cloud at Rackspace they made that team

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:49,310
made the decision actually to deploy

00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:52,010
that cloud on a private cloud internally

00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:54,020
so sort of like Inception but you're

00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:55,460
running a cloud on a cloud but

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,780
nevertheless she had those benefits and

00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,550
in one of the planning meetings they

00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,950
said how long will this take to deploy

00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,720
well the the team that's running the

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,160
backend systems that does the billing

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,600
and the customer account management said

00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,580
well we need to order the servers it'll

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,870
take three or four months and in another

00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,250
month or two to configure them and get

00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:13,100
them up and running so let's say five

00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:15,200
months and the the front-end team that's

00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,320
running the clouds software said well 30

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,580
40 minutes it can be really embarrassing

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,620
if you're not able to keep up with that

00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:23,600
so we could have this job done tomorrow

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:25,610
except for this team that has to manage

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,670
the hardware and therefore it's going to

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:30,020
take five months so that's where you

00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,850
need to look at some of the benefits

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,920
there if your business is moving quickly

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:36,680
and not having to get behind the curve

00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:41,920
on ordering and maintaining hardware and

00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:45,440
one of the problems to make be that the

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:47,690
technological possibility is there but

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,660
the company policy stance against it and

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:53,300
says it's nice that you can do it but we

00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:58,420
don't want it our data in the India auto

00:27:53,300 --> 00:28:01,300
clouds now in public clouds so here's

00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:04,640
many work to do to convince management

00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:07,000
to handle it or to create private

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,990
infrastructures that provide cloud

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,059
services to the internal company

00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:16,710
without leaving the company but it's

00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:19,110
still network I think the CTOs have to

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:23,010
keep exactly that in mind because a

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:25,559
modern infrastructure that wants to

00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:28,230
balance private cloud and public cloud

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:30,929
has to make some decisions so that the

00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:33,330
that the developers can write code and

00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:35,160
package it in a way that it can

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,440
seamlessly flow between public and

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,270
private cloud so I want to have an

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,490
infrastructure in my data center where I

00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:43,740
can take exactly the same bits and run

00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,570
it in the in my private data center and

00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,170
take these bits and run it a public

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:51,960
cloud it's an it's not an option to make

00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,730
everything by hand inside and do a

00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,380
completely different packaging and

00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,470
deployment algorithm in the cloud I

00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,050
think this this harmony is really

00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:04,530
important for enterprise IT s to try to

00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,480
come up with this private cloud and not

00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:11,580
only a data center with a bunch of

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,640
servers managed manually if we say okay

00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,960
the cloud is all about service and

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,970
developers are able to really

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,820
concentrate on what matters that means

00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:25,950
building services are not being

00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:28,110
distracted by other tasks and on the

00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:30,300
other hand given the fact that no

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:33,330
technology is is a silver bullet for

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:36,030
everything so maybe you can tell us a

00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:39,390
little bit where other some cases where

00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:41,850
you would not recommend to use some

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,350
cloud technologies there's something

00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,809
something some examples from your

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,610
perspective I think there's certainly a

00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,140
reason to avoid public cloud

00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,809
technologies because they're you're

00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:53,940
sharing resources with other potentially

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:56,700
evil people who want to do bad things to

00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:59,450
you so you know if you're a financial

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,800
services company you do lots of highly

00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:03,660
valuable transactions you probably want

00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,309
that isolated the that could be an

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:07,440
isolated server that could be an

00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:09,660
isolated private cloud though in which

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,220
case you're running cloud software on

00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:13,170
your own data center in which case you

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,160
get the benefits of cloud but you don't

00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:16,710
have the risk of sharing that

00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,120
infrastructure with other people so it's

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:20,580
it's not a perfect solution for

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:23,309
everything there may be there may in

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,789
fact be situations where you get more

00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:25,769
compute

00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:28,979
by having a dedicated machine for it or

00:30:25,769 --> 00:30:30,419
something I I can imagine that so it's

00:30:28,979 --> 00:30:32,249
not it's not a silver bullet it's not

00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:34,649
going to solve everything but you can

00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:37,499
even apply cloud technologies to

00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:40,590
physical Hardware OpenStack for example

00:30:37,499 --> 00:30:43,289
is working on an API for spinning up

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,090
physical servers so the idea is that you

00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:46,590
have a rack of servers pre-planned you

00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,570
now have a management software as I need

00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,340
a server it will go out and provision at

00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,690
five minutes later you have an actual

00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,989
physical server that you could use just

00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,820
as if it were a cloud server I also

00:30:54,989 --> 00:31:00,179
think that there are situations where

00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:02,159
the cloud is not appropriate security of

00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,109
course I I don't want to go into any

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,539
details here because it's everyone is

00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:10,320
aware of that but the cloud is really

00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:13,169
all about giving away responsibility but

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:15,929
also about giving away control about

00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:18,330
gaining economy of scope economy of

00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:20,549
scale effects and if you have just one

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:22,619
application and it's really complex it

00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:26,639
grew over the last 10 years and you have

00:31:22,619 --> 00:31:28,440
mixed up Delphi and C++ sent net and PHP

00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:30,619
and it's super complex to set up this

00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,090
machine and you just have one server

00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:35,249
automating a deployment process for such

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,489
an environment would cost a lot of money

00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:41,489
in time so it doesn't pay off just rent

00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:44,279
a server at Rackspace or whatever remote

00:31:41,489 --> 00:31:46,710
desktop in it and set it up and run it

00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:49,559
it's not cost efficient I think it's

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:51,269
cost efficiency from the cloud comes

00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:53,369
with economy of scale and economy of

00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:55,970
scope you have to do a lot of similar

00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:59,340
projects and then you can have benefits

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:03,539
yep also you have to think about the

00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:05,249
plan ability of outages in case of that

00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:07,979
you are providing or running a service

00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:12,119
that is that needs really to run 24

00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:15,210
hours each day and with your own IT you

00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:19,259
can plan your own outer outage for

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:21,929
maintenance reasons but if your provider

00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:23,789
is an external one like Amazon they are

00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:25,499
planning it so that's a control you're

00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:28,590
giving out of your hands and you have to

00:32:25,499 --> 00:32:31,619
take care that your solution can handle

00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:33,419
this yeg by by putting parts on

00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:35,510
different providers and different

00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:39,290
environments so that you can

00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:43,160
I have a kind of a solution independent

00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,990
of the cloud provider SLA is important

00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,080
and that's one of the driving things

00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,240
there it might be nice than amazon or

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,520
Rackspace will give you a payment for

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,320
being down but if you're running a

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,180
police or a fire department you can't

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,490
afford downtown you want that to be up

00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,960
always and so simply saying oh I'm going

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,180
to get a payment because it was down for

00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,770
two hours on Sunday night it is not

00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,150
valuable to you actually need to have

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:06,680
the service continually running and

00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,420
therefore that's when a situation you

00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,340
may want to run your own hardware and

00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,260
pay pay that expense for it but the

00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,510
questions are you able to run your own

00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,220
hardware and self butter than the

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:18,260
professionals out there do that's always

00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,320
the question you know is there a payoff

00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,630
there and what is it at least it's

00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:25,460
somewhat under your control you know if

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,290
you're a city government and there's a

00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,940
massive storm and it puts everything out

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:30,860
well then you may not be a situation

00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,590
where your system is down but the cloud

00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,560
stuff is still running the question is

00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:39,190
is Claude got the reliability to compete

00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,510
with a dedicated operation staff there

00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:44,600
and that's the really decision that you

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:46,910
have to make I think this area we have

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,890
to be aware of that we have one limit

00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:51,140
that we cannot discuss away and it's

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,810
simply the speed of light so if i run my

00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:57,200
application in I don't know dublin and

00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:59,540
the only users using this stuff is a

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,570
local government sitting here in germany

00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:04,490
and you have a latency problem and it is

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:07,460
definitely ruled by the speed of light

00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:10,820
between germany and and dublin so if you

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,800
run your server locally then it's there

00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,629
and if there is a big thunderstorm that

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,510
blows away the whole internet in europe

00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:20,000
you still have your server in your room

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,040
just beside you and you can still use it

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,629
the converse of that those of course if

00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,639
you're a small business in germany and

00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:28,310
you want to expand out you can go into a

00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,649
cloud provider that has data centers in

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,480
hong kong in sydney's little in South

00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,429
America and not have to incur that

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:37,850
expense yourself to set those up and run

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:39,679
them the Boston can I add one more thing

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:43,850
because I'm always wondering such an

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:46,399
audience why so little pay poses only a

00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:48,860
few people really use the cloud for

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,620
production and I make the ax

00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:53,000
perience that in a lot of cases

00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,190
management whoever management is in

00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,340
these companies just says hey no cloud

00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,890
it's too risky for us I I really want to

00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,350
encourage developers to just ask and

00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:06,100
educate I think it's important for us as

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:09,500
developers to try it and tell our

00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:12,830
management that business offerings are

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,130
not Facebook or ebay or things like that

00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:18,070
there is a big difference between

00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:20,300
consumer cloud like Facebook and

00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:22,820
business cloud for running business

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,570
applications and I think that we asked

00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,580
developers have to educate management so

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,950
that they understand that it's it's not

00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:33,220
careless use of data putting it

00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,380
somewhere in the cloud and then

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,270
immediately we also get management

00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:41,200
support because there is a business

00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:45,350
value in the cloud and opposite of agree

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,710
we as early adopters of developers have

00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:51,050
to have to get aware of those

00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:54,740
possibilities of those technologies of

00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:57,500
the pros and cons and then take this to

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,050
convince the management that clouds are

00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,210
just a tool in a very good tool and this

00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:04,910
tool can we used in many business cases

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:09,520
and is helpful in very very lots of

00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:13,250
business cases but it's us to develop to

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,770
educate the management maybe this

00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:18,230
conversation made a few people a little

00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,210
curious on the different concepts so as

00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:24,410
a last question maybe I'd like to ask

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:27,230
all of you or please give the paper

00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:30,410
right here in the room hint where should

00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:32,540
they start so how to try out what yeah

00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,070
what would you recommend well I very

00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:36,110
first step to get a little bit more

00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,300
experience and maybe something to

00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:40,340
document and some experience which you

00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,350
can document and forward to your boss

00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:44,120
etc well if you go to developer

00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:45,890
Rackspace com there's a link there you

00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,440
can sign up and get a free credit for

00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:50,060
six months so you can go play with it a

00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,670
lot of people get started their amazon

00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,410
has a similar program as well as do

00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:56,300
others i'm sure has something like that

00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:58,760
pits low budget and the cool thing is

00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:02,109
you don't have to shell out thousands of

00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:03,970
euros for a server you can can

00:37:02,109 --> 00:37:05,440
get it free and spin up servers and try

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:08,200
this and then demonstrate it to your

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:14,259
management very easily and it almost no

00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:17,140
cost to you exactly it's simply try it

00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:20,009
most most providers want to have you as

00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:24,220
your customers so they provide an

00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:27,099
program for open source developers to to

00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:31,420
adopt those technologies for low price

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:33,670
all today they provide you a small

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,819
number of resources but it is enough for

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,980
testing so that you can test it make you

00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:40,809
first experiences with it and there are

00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,730
different ways that yes

00:37:40,809 --> 00:37:45,029
infrastructure-as-a-service s rec space

00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:48,039
is providing amazon is providing a

00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:51,609
platform as a service where you use the

00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:55,450
api of the provider as Google App Engine

00:37:51,609 --> 00:37:56,890
or Microsoft is providing I would like

00:37:55,450 --> 00:38:00,130
to make my statement as concrete as

00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:03,400
possible if Microsoft is a possible

00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:06,249
technology for you not net could also be

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,829
no door whatever but if Microsoft cloud

00:38:06,249 --> 00:38:10,930
is an option and you have an idea being

00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,989
an entrepreneur life I am for instance

00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:16,150
check out the the spark programs of

00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:19,150
Microsoft things like this spark

00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:21,730
dreamspark you will get for more than

00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:24,130
two years a lot of money free cloud

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:27,099
resources free we shal studio licenses

00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:28,809
free licenses for servers to run I know

00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,999
some active directory in your company

00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:35,769
it's absolutely free and it's there for

00:38:30,999 --> 00:38:39,609
people having an idea and want to try it

00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:41,049
simply try it failing is ok you can try

00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,390
multiple things but you don't have to

00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:46,450
invest a lot of money so dreamspark base

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,859
part was of great help for us living in

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:50,739
the Microsoft environment of course

00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:53,440
because it's a Microsoft program so

00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:55,869
thank you very much I think we've seen

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,499
that maybe cloud technologies is not for

00:38:55,869 --> 00:39:01,539
every particular business business today

00:38:58,499 --> 00:39:03,910
relevant but we can all be sure cloud

00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:06,099
technologies in the future are going to

00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,470
matter in every case so thank you very

00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:11,769
much thanks for the panelists here and

00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,809
