Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	When you‚Äôre building successful startup, there‚Äôs always lack of resources, time and ability to implement enterprise level architecture. You start with minimum valuable product, then think which features would you customers need, then fight with your competitors. However, time is going and earlier or later, you would need to come back to all your architectural technical debt, make a pause and think, how will you grow further. In this session I‚Äôd like to share our experience gained in Regiondo ‚Äì startup which is currently being transformed into enterprise level company. We will talk about service oriented architecture, domain driven design and other general concepts and practice. We will think together, how to refactor your production application step by step without complete switch off / switch on. And I will tell you how we are doing this today in Regiondo
