Title: Aggressive PHP Quality Assurance in 2019 | Marco Pivetta
Publication date: 2019-11-22
Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	PHP has a reputation for being a very flexible, yet very messy programming language: Keeping the chaos at bay requires a non-trivial amount of cognitive load and technical expertise.
In this talk, we will explore how quality assurance for popular open source packages has evolved in the past few years, and how we can further improve our own projects. We will cover architectural practices, naming, code design, tooling and how to avoid common pitfalls that waste everyone‚Äôs time. With this experience, we can all help the PHP ecosystem in further evolutions.
