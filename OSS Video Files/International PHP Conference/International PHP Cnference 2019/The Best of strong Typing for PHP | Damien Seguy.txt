Publication date: 2020-03-17
Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	Strong typing is spreading across PHP: PHP 7.4 is adding it to class properties, after it was added to arguments and return values. While typing goes against the initial choices of weak typing in PHP, it also brings more code consistency, auto-validation features and probably some strange puzzles with dependencies. Typing lends a helping hand to quality tools, makes code validation work harder and earlier, and promotes great coding pattern like nulll object. Indeed, it is a brave new tool, great for large projects and easy to use tacticallly.
