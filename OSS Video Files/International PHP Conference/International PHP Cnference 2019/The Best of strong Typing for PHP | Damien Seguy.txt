Title: The Best of strong Typing for PHP | Damien Seguy
Publication date: 2020-03-17
Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	Strong typing is spreading across PHP: PHP 7.4 is adding it to class properties, after it was added to arguments and return values. While typing goes against the initial choices of weak typing in PHP, it also brings more code consistency, auto-validation features and probably some strange puzzles with dependencies. Typing lends a helping hand to quality tools, makes code validation work harder and earlier, and promotes great coding pattern like nulll object. Indeed, it is a brave new tool, great for large projects and easy to use tacticallly.

[Music]

00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:12,220
[Applause]

00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:19,530
[Music]

00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:31,580
adults and use more we will be both

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:31,580
presenting event

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,930
I refer to prison both the other digits

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,030
think that will help you and think of

00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,820
you being you know hidden traps that

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:49,089
probably will be mean to you and be a

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:51,860
problem when you try to work with them

00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:54,589
but I think that we - type in for the

00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,190
moment is very speaking that has been

00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:59,360
evolving

00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:00,739
a lot since the beginning yes but it has

00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,390
been holding it off so there are new

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,360
things coming up with every new version

00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:08,119
so we will start with a little review so

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,340
make sure everyone our office is now and

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,100
we can remove everything that is rumors

00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,780
about that not exist yet but that will

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,420
be coming or maybe not because it's

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,720
still under the screen and then we will

00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:23,149
take me as typing and then effect on two

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,570
different things which are along one

00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:28,399
border this is the method signature by

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,850
letter than it functions daughter or

00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:34,160
whoever is supporting typing in so we

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,729
will do one what part of what is the

00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,049
back of that means inside the misses by

00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:41,270
the fact that you're using that as

00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:44,570
argument on the arguments and the return

00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:47,210
value and then we'll also work on what

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:50,659
the facts the findings of the system by

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,650
itself where you will be changing orders

00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:56,040
and

00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:59,400
classes priorities as an application so

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:05,009
that's the systemic approach first and

00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:06,960
then inside then outside so when why

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,220
this this information to our time and

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,680
working a CTO on a static analysis ng

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:16,620
analysis and you just love typing okay

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,600
we understand exactly what's happening

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,120
whenever he was doing something into a

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,220
function you have just no new operative

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,130
between except the name and even another

00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,290
name is completely render and a feature

00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:30,959
we studied at least know what's coming

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,500
in so we can do is go check okay so

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,620
that's why I could spend a lot of time

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,769
and I also often seem to a retirement

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,590
home for Elephants where the country

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,870
auctioneer and new powerful very young

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,060
girls and so that's another of the

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,049
competing technologies with speech very

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,150
nice that people so that means we just

00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,880
keep if you do everything I'm pretty

00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:01,260
sure that information there are reasons

00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:04,140
so that we could review they are the

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,420
thing that is on the left side of the

00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:13,769
arguments when you are writing as a

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:15,660
stream I mean a c-major okay so if you

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,690
looking at a technique on the right side

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,549
it's wrong it's a default value

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,530
completely different okay but on the

00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,540
left side then you have every year and

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,030
at the end the return type of

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,659
destruction which means that not an

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,810
argument with the way but yes

00:03:29,659 --> 00:03:36,959
Jupiter will be after to our current and

00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:38,849
it feels lovely we will use different

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,609
things most of the time strong tank

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:44,459
evenings classes and interfaces so you

00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:47,549
can have been here can attend here that

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,799
are also under the spell of the use so

00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:51,420
we've got to use aliases chance to then

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:57,120
make that pretty short chin psycho

00:03:51,420 --> 00:04:00,329
diffusion simple and then we've got the

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,939
actual code behind that now there are

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:05,430
other ways and other places where we can

00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:07,709
stop seeing I think particularly if you

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,810
already working or trying to work with

00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:13,500
speech be settled before we begin the

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:17,579
properties that will be enter tightly it

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:23,099
works the same as arguments I means that

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:26,310
you cannot you cannot put anything else

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:30,360
on the user objects in that property and

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,830
it will be checked at its occasional you

00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,250
will actually start with the default

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,740
value but until the property will be

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,020
assigned with first value it will just

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,520
be completely and accessible you will

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,610
probably run into that a lot when you

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,680
decide without properties affecting

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,440
properties because basically you need

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,409
you cannot do this opening except to

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,009
know which is important to use this but

00:04:52,409 --> 00:05:01,569
until you actually understand is mission

00:04:56,009 --> 00:05:06,219
performance editor then new access then

00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:08,889
into everyone changes and there are some

00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:11,259
rumors about giving by about local

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:12,219
rivals with the Titans but it's just

00:05:11,259 --> 00:05:13,959
that a river

00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:16,360
okay I'm pretty sure there are people

00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,249
for me as about that because of course

00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,869
we have absolutely no declaration for

00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:22,719
the rainbow so we don't know what to put

00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:25,179
that so the moment is you see them with

00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:28,300
my nose it means that it's attracted the

00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:30,309
HP dark for the static analysis being

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,809
that it's an engineer we're not going to

00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:45,279
talk about that okay

00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:49,029
easy over there right and the first one

00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:51,399
nephew scatter is where the girl floats

00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:53,740
do not use real people's incentive for

00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:58,349
these are gone there's no more real test

00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,999
Roach so just use drones here string and

00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:03,099
objects different from the transform

00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:05,619
because of that just means one object

00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:07,930
what it was it was okay

00:06:05,619 --> 00:06:10,360
the event attracts means an object all

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,399
that specific track so it's people more

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,159
precise but those are the default one

00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,589
there are some extended one in our cover

00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:20,379
goober between the classes and the

00:06:17,589 --> 00:06:21,969
scatterers which is particular or which

00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:24,579
one particularly terrible

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:26,889
so either about we cover everything that

00:06:24,579 --> 00:06:31,279
it can be through after for each

00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:34,069
statement that means array

00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,709
Ashima bravery's over the array of

00:06:34,069 --> 00:06:40,179
seduction TV but that also means every

00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:44,419
class that actually finished your access

00:06:40,179 --> 00:06:48,019
interface instead of having to check

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:50,149
something I accept arrays or exits and

00:06:48,019 --> 00:06:53,539
memory access or I've said also

00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:55,309
generators then you can introduce Beauty

00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,889
terrible at everything below

00:06:55,309 --> 00:07:01,339
what about to be covering everything

00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:03,829
that's cockerel nested go back and you

00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:08,239
know I teach me we've got a wide range

00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:11,869
of possibilities strings arrays class

00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:14,929
syntax class colors and classes if I

00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:17,839
have got lots of ways to declare and

00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:19,369
address reference a class so Corriveau

00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:23,799
will be that with you can be cook you

00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:25,519
can call would be under that thank you

00:07:23,799 --> 00:07:27,919
interventional classes we've already

00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:30,979
covered that simple not accept their of

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,249
some specific things traits cannot be

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,929
use so we should move the traits and the

00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:37,399
trade to be recognized as something

00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:39,499
special then you have to make an

00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:41,479
interface from the traits and then

00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:45,860
change the interface of the training we

00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:49,669
use for traits as then I could be

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:53,209
cooking based or class you can also use

00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:56,360
self and parent self between a

00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:59,419
representing the class itself even if

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,369
the main change convenient and parent

00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:05,739
will is will represent everything that's

00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,739
the bogey from class parent

00:08:34,210 --> 00:09:16,210
so that means if you decide to write an

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:20,510
argument as no well there's just one

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:24,230
possible value right which is No so of

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:26,510
course it is Rangers each meter so you

00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,280
could actually type it as no or decide

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,470
to ally with another man they were

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:32,630
already figured the little horn object

00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:35,030
of that play then we've got the special

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,260
thing that has a question mark you are

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:39,110
on top of the author

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:42,070
so it's a very special situation or the

00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:44,530
particular one we will bring you mean

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:48,490
is what for return time because if you

00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:50,080
can drop an argument be gentle but these

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,780
energies who is there

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,770
there's always something winter even if

00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:58,390
this return is nothing we know and

00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:01,240
that's how you wind up with the ball ok

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:04,540
so the argument may be Noble and return

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,490
value may be no but you have to end up

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,150
with this paradox right when he was

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:12,370
mathematicians so how did you defeat

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:14,230
which exerted on your admission and then

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:15,520
the mathematician of H will say we

00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:21,850
should finish because you know there are

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:24,490
sizes but here we've got several signs

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:27,730
of nothing because we've got no remember

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:31,120
L means nothing everything is something

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,980
except now which is nothing and then

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,750
there's forward and forward is something

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:40,300
you each other when they don't return

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:41,860
anything including nothing to bodies

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,190
when you region have sweetly nothing you

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,900
have no return inside the better if you

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,260
we don't know you are returning

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:53,110
something even something is nothing and

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:55,060
then you cannot actually which important

00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,500
have to return something else if you

00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,690
live about that that makes an Excel

00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,360
table to disagree

00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:04,360
anyway so we are not Chile for our goals

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:07,270
and J speaking will control point these

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,670
speaking situation here because we can

00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:15,140
very advantageous be with crazy

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:18,880
no matter which objects or pneumatic

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:21,920
traps which the design battery that's

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,450
objective is to get rid of no use in

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,250
general now okay so if you want to get

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,670
rid of them in general because you have

00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,260
to use a new pattern class so what we

00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,730
don't know when we need it before value

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,960
in particular without length but we do

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:40,430
use now because know can be written we

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,110
are not going to return as a default

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,510
value but then it doesn't do anything

00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,810
except that if you want to use this no

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,930
major even array object syntax to call

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:52,790
the method of a property but now is

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:53,780
really nothing is not even an object it

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,790
will stop myself

00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:57,800
it rather error I cannot access a

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:01,010
property because you didn't know that

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,500
the solution so what we do is that we

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,480
create previously for their own packages

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,730
and objects that satisfy them the same

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,760
interface and the object we trying to

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:13,760
replace so we're amending any kind of

00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,130
instance was interface you create the

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,500
second class with the same interface but

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,950
as much as you can every method will do

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,680
the minimum word possible which is a

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,120
value is always very funny you want to

00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,950
create a trance most of it that is

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,840
proper coordinate but this one has to be

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:30,670
the shoulders it's almost like just a

00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,150
skillet

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:37,840
anything that you return not know but

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,340
you return an industry you return a 0 if

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,740
you know that this value will be used

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,880
for addition you return it to Y new this

00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:45,460
value will be used for works

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,580
pronunciation you return a leader age

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:51,040
which was supposed to be territories

00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,290
which is that now these subjects act as

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,480
know you can conclude just like

00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:01,060
everything when you say you work please

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,000
Europe ancestry whatever everything but

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:04,810
you can still use it inside the code and

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,810
that's very very good

00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:10,030
every reason okay in terms of

00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:12,580
developments I also use it as an

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,250
exception pattern so if I want to use

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:17,950
this male object a picture that anyone

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:22,510
is using it really I will put actually

00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:24,640
flowing through exception examples one

00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,310
of the methods for this way I make sure

00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:28,900
that my code is just using each and

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,960
please replace back something that makes

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,060
sense and if it's not it's used or try

00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:40,780
to be used and zero and it's a sense

00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:45,130
with regard to different so I would say

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:51,630
there's no pattern that's now in terms

00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:52,920
of adoption our surprise there

00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,800
[Music]

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,019
everything before you actually I'll do

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,779
something that not ninety percent

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:04,459
density of each people nowadays use type

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:08,339
it really ask you both good days

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:11,430
otherwise there will be a few them so

00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:13,399
almost everyone is doing what this does

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:17,449
not show you because is a really rough

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:20,670
presentation is the actual adoption and

00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:24,180
this is the percentage of the coach that

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:31,250
is covered of you to the bottom this is

00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:31,250
the percentage of the of the actually

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:41,310
there's a torturer of the goal that just

00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,070
like be turned one of them

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:48,720
nothing more so yes they will reduce

00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:55,440
thank you but I don't know even thousand

00:14:48,720 --> 00:15:02,730
parameters is back to using okay the

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:08,160
other person is like one class and two

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:09,690
visits oh yeah to go that way but nobody

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,670
is basically about the integration

00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:17,699
that's even beta completely will be

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,120
written from last six months the user

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:23,089
not me but it cannot reach the top so

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,699
don't try to practice rent and

00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,529
and one of the person we still need a

00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:30,679
number of things before we reach that

00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:34,369
other the other satirical interesting

00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:39,649
degree in stats is this breakdown so the

00:15:34,369 --> 00:15:42,519
different types of patents the different

00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:45,079
types of titles have been gathered here

00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:48,649
classes is covering everything by

00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:51,439
classes and interfaces okay and you can

00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:54,559
see that basically half the projects are

00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:56,359
using those kind of effective this one

00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,689
is the special one I just corrected on

00:15:56,359 --> 00:16:01,789
the scanner taken deep into one so you

00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:03,859
see that truth will be three we are more

00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:06,739
using scanner than eating that class

00:16:03,859 --> 00:16:08,929
despite engine which is not probably

00:16:06,739 --> 00:16:13,129
which the other state that will try to

00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:15,169
move don't ideals but the easiest way is

00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,449
just social everything and start using

00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:23,989
the type T where n is not dangerous

00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:26,929
process one can see before of the

00:16:23,989 --> 00:16:29,689
population is losing less of twenty five

00:16:26,929 --> 00:16:32,569
percent so it's still the beginning when

00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:35,179
it's easy just to have one and despite

00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:40,849
the method is at once anyway so it's

00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:51,289
fine from poverty one the other girls to

00:16:40,849 --> 00:16:54,139
see in a moment is to go inside the

00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:56,119
method what is the impact of fighting

00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,949
inside method how are you going to run

00:16:56,119 --> 00:17:00,249
goodd differently because you're using

00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:00,249
tag

00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:10,250
and I would say people move to our which

00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:14,569
thank you is because you are far better

00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:15,140
chicken than we used to do just look at

00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:17,209
this one

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,860
we are expecting any thinner and for

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,020
some reason we are doing actually the

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,449
the check so we have that have to do if

00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,839
it's another integer than with one error

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:28,820
or we actually do the work if we want to

00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,070
get rid of all that piece of code which

00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,410
is both understand that people remember

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,870
don't remember about which all the time

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:45,610
and we end up is just the timing here

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:47,840
and just well it's like really shorter

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:50,059
shorter system money source of the

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,429
checks and you just leaders you having

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:55,010
the arguments of course all the time you

00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:58,130
will take care of that word ye city

00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:01,610
security so far is about this one much

00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:04,850
later and more systematic usage you

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:07,809
should if you want to do that move you

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,809
should check all those

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,150
[Music]

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,150
[Music]

00:18:31,769 --> 00:19:25,590
so next consistency consistency is what

00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:29,700
I call the East Worship Center of all

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:32,220
big big ppt - burn right diverse their

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,159
poor sister post will look for streaming

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,940
sunscreen and it will return you either

00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,419
the offset at which the streamer song or

00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:46,520
a little force

00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:46,520
except that retrieve offset start

00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:53,280
automatic in that moment so it returns

00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,679
zero so if this substring only in the

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,940
novice tree is not at zero and you just

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,260
compare this here as their boss well

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,030
nothing that force with the dominate

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:05,280
well then the folks at the zero will be

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:07,770
kind of mixed and you will actually skip

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,510
a number of situations okay so here

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:11,039
that's is nothing but being that you'll

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,840
be trying to have this function we do

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,539
something with it but to give up arrow

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,370
return false and these people end up

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,010
with a range of zero for you more baby

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,320
then move on maybe we'll be just

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:25,140
confused with error and then that will

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:28,289
be a part okay so if you move to that

00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,750
means for the return type of moving away

00:20:28,289 --> 00:20:33,270
from the operating one wing to the time

00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:35,549
the problem is about people calling your

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:37,650
functionalities your own course that has

00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:40,370
to be consistent and only will be German

00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,809
one and only one type of information

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,350
which mean that we also have enough to

00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:48,270
find another way to end all the errors

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:49,980
the here with the age you can return a

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:52,289
minus one it's the people through

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:54,720
comparison until someone who's talking I

00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,549
would just in that as it is and start

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,789
pushing it everywhere so it will end up

00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:02,280
with ages that do not add up to the

00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:04,289
right value that in the back here bro do

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:08,520
you have to stop changing your system

00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:11,700
and maybe move to make our exceptions of

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:17,500
our communal property that we saw errors

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:22,600
with some hydration

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:25,430
feda consciousness systems actually also

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:28,850
cannot help you wonder of who is going

00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,980
to handle the power now we should attack

00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:33,770
will return a string so we could

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,800
actually and almost type hints the

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:39,350
return type bar mystery because you know

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,820
that pretty good straight exception I

00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:44,240
think do not return a string to another

00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,460
string or know if something happens and

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,460
it will return though so it's not

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,070
consistent it's actually anything it is

00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:58,820
the work of deciding what to do with the

00:21:52,070 --> 00:22:00,950
shinseki hey here well I don't know what

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,320
to decide

00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,020
so we'll just leave that to the next one

00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,050
whoever is calling me we'd have to do

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,790
the checking of the result effect and it

00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:14,350
will just preppin up until someone say

00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,350
oh I cannot do it

00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:24,830
so this consistency between one off can

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:27,350
I take over the problem and decided that

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,810
but yeah to return a string and if it's

00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:32,000
on screen I will net it because now

00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,280
shares it with famine be aware of

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,650
physical situations or problems with

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,190
your way okay I just can if that

00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:39,190
interests me

00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:09,430
from there you don't understand why the

00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:10,570
hell gets an industry into this very

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,260
important function

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:17,290
just stop panting things with street

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,420
value on string of faculty so here with

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:22,090
the different goals different goals now

00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:25,300
we use we are the we are the targets and

00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:27,190
now ever since ratified then if anything

00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,210
is wrong it's not the expected time

00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:33,850
together the fire as a tool of just

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,580
protocol test from your tests or manual

00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,980
tests until you get errors that we know

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,400
who was holding and go there it's the

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,290
origin and try again what happens with

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,540
this is probably what we have so many

00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,270
sort of such a large percentage of the

00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,090
code base that are using at two or three

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:54,130
typing you know is that usually you will

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,680
find off of those errors so that way to

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:58,240
determining to get off of error speaks

00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,280
of sugar and realize it's been to

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,190
preparer then you start getting those

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,380
error less and less but still and so you

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,850
need a bigger and you don't know where

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,820
to stop you don't know when to remove it

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:13,800
so you just read their as we have some

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,800
tradition it has been

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:27,750
[Music]

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:39,150
if they will do they are able to look at

00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:41,980
the cold and decide that in seconds

00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:44,799
you'll actually have yesterday

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,630
that will help you decide that looking

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:49,660
at the new page and assigning that euro

00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:51,549
pupil to safely st. in the stream and

00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:54,640
then well decide if you want to do it

00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:57,520
now what does it mean by base the

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,770
village well often the argument

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,960
themselves are relating to other

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,720
functions in particular the one for

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,150
which we have the typing is teaching

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,320
magic potions so here everyone over here

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,710
every field will actually help you

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,850
create an array from zero to here P

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:21,250
elements with always always a popular so

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,830
if you want to do the civilization of an

00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:26,730
array and not just our heroes instead of

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:30,880
people for each of the ratios

00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:34,809
continuation but here we say rápido we

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:45,130
will do the read from zero to be with

00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:47,470
the value C B's on the other hand the

00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:51,780
second one is a little more tricky but

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:54,610
we don't exactly the plus is ambiguous

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,650
the one tell us is forbidden to be an

00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:59,080
addition but then the constants we don't

00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:01,750
we go and what are we going to be German

00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,320
so the second one is based on the poles

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,100
themselves

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,870
we see that in words introduced yourself

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,000
but basically you say we see that of the

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,750
calls of these methods is only on the

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,090
range then we can decide that we say

00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:18,340
and those are the single situation where

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:24,820
you actually learn how to how to decide

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:27,640
what kind of now it is the depiction

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,500
will actually end up choking enough

00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,560
support because the sister is you will

00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:42,400
see here is say foo and we create an

00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:45,370
array from of ten elements of B another

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,430
point as a developer you know what to do

00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:51,550
or maybe you want lots of things to be

00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:54,190
there and then we cannot thank you we

00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,720
cannot miss it maybe a human being we

00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,760
cannot even think about it and our

00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:00,040
talents is just not possible because

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,160
there is nothing to tie everything is

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:06,940
possible we have no support from X no

00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,740
typing is so rich 100 percent is

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:10,480
probably the reason we don't have the

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:12,400
last 10 percent ever because they have

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,240
situation where that it is not yet

00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,830
possible maybe in 75 now that we are

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,330
done with the properties maybe that will

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,000
help us you know identifying those

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:30,370
situations and start building more

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:33,400
syntax before HTH the same thing for

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:37,080
Richard with the Box you see nobody

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,080
shall exact we cannot say

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:46,000
there's like what major advantage and

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,620
also situation rather than system liver

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,470
is the movement there are a lot of them

00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:55,300
okay but just let see how they are very

00:28:50,470 --> 00:29:01,300
unusual what happens if you use function

00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:06,610
get ox remember this one with this early

00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:08,530
before function but if you have to it

00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:12,790
allows you to have variable amounts of

00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:15,280
arguments in the method if you can like

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:17,920
90% of the situation you can do it your

00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,190
brain using the variables which is the

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,050
three time of about it will actually get

00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,270
anything that's beyond this argument

00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:28,360
into one array and when you manipulate

00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:30,130
as one and that most of the private

00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:32,200
things like you have one or two specific

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,360
arguments and then after that everything

00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,010
is just at the same time and will

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:45,340
probably end up in terrain and treated

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:47,140
as a which emerge all the time only hope

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,670
because we get all the arguments and

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,840
based on the position you will decide

00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:55,750
let's move the street or or class Aviva

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,610
any variety verse five because you can

00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,950
use the grade each of the arguments and

00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:02,830
then say that it's all thing will be

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:08,650
speak so the first goal with your

00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:11,360
brights was often a string to everyone

00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:15,390
individually package

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:18,809
it's not worth getting your race sprayed

00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:22,919
them and the NDP again for them it's

00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:26,760
just too cumbersome don't do that arrays

00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:30,360
so arrays I think to be a pain we

00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,590
because the array is a type II coverage

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:38,970
will also using our terrain the gossipy

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:41,700
the problem is the razor box so yes you

00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:44,700
can about each return off the top of the

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:46,950
box it's a box of keys but maybe inside

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,830
you just got angry bees there's

00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:51,270
absolutely no check of what's inside you

00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,330
just know it's a box and there's

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:56,370
something needs you can shake it company

00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:59,190
but you know half I can open it really

00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:01,980
and check everything minute video d12

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:03,840
current leaders a lot of debates about

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,850
what we can do with that there is no

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,350
solution for the enemy protein seven

00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,870
four seven three

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:12,600
there is no implementation that the

00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,419
solution would be generated which will

00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:17,940
reverse to say it's a ray of something

00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:19,500
and then peach we should be able to say

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,330
okay Vicki red but I don't have an

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,500
instruction every Goodson direction

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:29,549
everything and then tell you it's far

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:31,350
the limitation by 2016 another one more

00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:34,399
recently but we didn't mean the cuts off

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:36,480
seven four so it's not come here

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,700
appropriate is not a description of how

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,429
to infinite them the other want to be at

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:46,070
that are between appellants or static

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:46,070
analysis tool which may have implemented

00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:55,040
so again the offer will be there is

00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,929
arriving so if you want to talk to him

00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:10,010
and have more insight and all kind of

00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:12,440
generics and so arranged that you start

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:14,450
with zero itself and there's nothing

00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,960
better to do another one running they

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:21,140
asked problems is almost magic gets and

00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,299
sets because those are all just like

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:26,450
what it reports for all the properties

00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:28,700
to be sent our youth and then yes I see

00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:31,340
so on top of that non 74 we can make

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,580
sure that the property itself with all

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,860
the specific value type of money and get

00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,630
the set of course but they should be

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,480
able to get everything so it's not

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,850
really possible to that if you pretty

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,429
well or if your situation allows it and

00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:49,580
you actually can type things so we can

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:52,429
say I'm gonna set the aim here is always

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:55,040
a list of prime numbers

00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:59,480
I want always to be set it spans about

00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:01,669
yes then we can just for a side you can

00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,799
also times name as adoration and it's

00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:05,630
the PHP to check then the name of the

00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:08,240
body of the property your psyche is an

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:12,220
array of course that doesn't work but

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,220
each day actually handles itself just

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,020
because you cannot again you're not

00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:28,059
giving this other situation to the

00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:29,830
center beautiful die if you want to end

00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:31,929
up all those mythical bats and doing the

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,500
checks but that's you want to accept

00:33:31,929 --> 00:33:39,370
both integers and an array then again

00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:42,280
inside there is no we are get them into

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:47,200
tight for cash so that worked for a

00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:50,860
while but it's not coming up in personal

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,220
version of teacher so just staying cash

00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:55,990
and here I actually want to use

00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:01,210
everything from that because there's a

00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:03,309
huge problem here the huge problem is

00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:04,600
that you exit our which may be anything

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:06,789
there is no patents

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:08,590
and then we say okay consider air I

00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:11,770
guess the figure up and add something

00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:15,310
and that returns otherwise expect it to

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:17,740
be an object which means that consider

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:20,830
though I said an array then it will pass

00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,389
the first a sticker then I will actually

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,570
try to use it as a derailleur and that

00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,429
will stop the world the workshop

00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:29,820
anytime you are doing nothing inside

00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,679
manually you should actually turn them

00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,050
explicitly so if it's in Figure and do

00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:37,629
something if this is an instance of an

00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:40,330
object I know I can do the course from a

00:34:37,629 --> 00:34:42,369
course on here and the final one she'll

00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:45,639
probably be the default value oh that's

00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:48,010
not taking actually any advantage on

00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:51,970
usage of the in photography because we

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:53,919
don't know what's that we cannot use a

00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:56,010
switch because each time we actually

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,839
have to do a call to a function

00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:04,970
and then he went up is always those big

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:07,049
ears okay in fact to lead me to this

00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,170
intimidation I think that may finally

00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:13,349
Dakotas that should be great

00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:16,440
we mentioned earlier that's the thing

00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:19,109
should be done well to be precise the

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:21,000
tactic should be not a concrete class to

00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:24,030
be an interface because the thing is

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,460
that with the evolution of the code what

00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:28,980
you had as a class initially may become

00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,859
a second version it may be a mock object

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,010
because you want to use that later as

00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:38,430
test it may give you a pass only said

00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,680
the new version or my vision and if you

00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:43,710
are actually type teaching against a

00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,690
concrete class then whatever evolution

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,220
discuss ads will have an impact on

00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,520
whoever is using the graphs all

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:53,040
extending it the best way is actually to

00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,500
great little things and make sure that

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,339
the Titans are truly is made based in

00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:01,530
the VEX for which you have number of

00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:03,869
implementations and you can add always a

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,819
third or fourth view in presentation and

00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:08,490
still ship it to this method and

00:36:05,819 --> 00:36:12,089
individual to expect you do not depend

00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:14,369
on the previous code or extending on top

00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:17,119
of that after we make per view that

00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:20,069
interfaces themselves can be extended

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,640
meaning that is excited interface this

00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:25,530
conservation of some point of change

00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,550
them and enough for something that

00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,670
really moving video

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:36,510
you see that all a lot man do not fight

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:39,160
it against the glass industry that said

00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:41,740
you can end up with problems like that

00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:46,810
there are two problems in the circle

00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:48,340
here the first one is we have an

00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,730
interface here with the fruit function

00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:54,010
and then we have the piping here visit

00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:57,730
class we don't care about the tradition

00:36:54,010 --> 00:37:01,420
but if the good runs that sufficient

00:36:57,730 --> 00:37:11,020
first we call it here but doing the core

00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:13,000
of the property people enforces the

00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:21,820
phases will enforce that we actually

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:24,700
have a function so the interface tightly

00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:31,390
here is not sufficient it will only

00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:35,230
check the methods for P oh I'm peachy so

00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:37,540
I will loop doesn t we can go on but

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,520
there's no checking on the property so

00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:49,000
the only way you have to make the

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:53,500
property available would be 12 yes the

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,210
other point we'd only see when you see

00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:59,080
before me to the solution is that

00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:59,859
interface will be checked that object

00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,950
and trance

00:37:59,859 --> 00:38:04,570
so if you have here he will be to method

00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,260
that's fine but if you also decide to

00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:13,720
use a prop

00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:16,450
this professor that's not properly that

00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:18,430
believe only applies and this nature of

00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,350
them after that in whatever you want to

00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:25,620
be offered so it's kind of food we

00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:28,720
created a verification now our property

00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:30,580
probably rather I have to try to push

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,430
you back to the class either you make

00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:35,890
centers leaders for water properties so

00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:38,920
you avoid using properties in type int

00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:42,130
emitters if you don't have two thousand

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,700
errors okay then keep the property

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:47,380
itself go back to there and do not make

00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,150
a complete class just make it an

00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,610
abstract class so you can have several

00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,890
versions that can be available so that

00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,600
can use that any the same time and

00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,060
forces like that there will be this new

00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:09,040
person or property available all the

00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:11,520
time for the inside of the function we

00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,980
will to stop there will be a spot

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,200
this is systemic impact thank you

00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:21,040
because what you see here it will not be

00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:23,350
there not our curly braces we decide

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,480
that anything is coming in we want

00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:27,880
bigger and whoever is particulars asked

00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,880
to give a simulator so it cannot she's

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:32,440
the problem back to somewhere else you

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,200
know you don't find to send any dinner

00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:37,800
time haha error and which tickets

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,800
together

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:43,150
to be good as a system given to at least

00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:46,599
putting each other and using the wrong

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:49,390
time that's meant to be wrong so we

00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,270
start with something very simple just to

00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:57,430
stop giving you an idea of the proper

00:39:52,270 --> 00:40:01,809
gap is very abstract but this is

00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:04,089
referring it will be a moment this is a

00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:07,150
framework which has a certain number of

00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:10,510
classes but the classes are only inside

00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:12,700
available from the three methods and one

00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:16,680
and two and three as you can see someone

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,970
proper documentation is extremely few

00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,040
it's a very special framework at the

00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:23,589
moment we will make it more in later but

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,839
I want to use it so super now and you

00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:28,180
understand the difference in path

00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,280
integral we have three functions no

00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,589
precondition we can use any of them at

00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,210
any time and if they do they will

00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:48,549
provide us this classes which are not

00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:53,520
representative weird but how do we use

00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:53,520
that how can we use this framework

00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:59,540
the living is not available but if we

00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:02,120
are like creates the name updates and as

00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,460
if she could read us and we'll you know

00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,260
our a little English and decide that oh

00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:08,780
yeah I have to learn to first create

00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,210
then I can use a date has been done

00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:14,180
wrong but when I do that I can just

00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:17,420
create them directly but I already get

00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:19,070
some documentation the manual itself to

00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:20,420
understand which way our border that is

00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,980
there an order which there something

00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,400
that is the first I have to do something

00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,400
at the end

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:32,180
we could actually try to teach me way

00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:35,980
like go then one after each other do

00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,980
something do not break the pattern error

00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:46,550
it works if we get some typing the

00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:49,250
condition if the enemy is from the tops

00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:51,290
of the arguments or it was we're at the

00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:54,110
top and what we get is the result at the

00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:57,050
bottom here you know who all contains

00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:59,240
preventing the everything so we can see

00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,070
what gap here the first one is called

00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,620
with our arguments of every scanner

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,410
argument so we can just randomly create

00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:09,290
them and that in the function if we

00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:11,270
gotta give us a pollutant class and that

00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:13,670
the bluegrass happy reused or becomes

00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:16,880
three into several realm and then in

00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:19,130
push them into n2 to get another kind of

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,480
class which is now on the bed class and

00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:28,060
then the rest class can do against that

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:28,060
into n3 and then get we need

00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:36,510
now expel the title here is giving us

00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:39,660
the order in which we are treated what

00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:43,230
we'll handle is the result attach the

00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,660
tie things even if we don't think about

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:48,180
it when we do that we are changing we

00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:50,640
are creating a precedence treatment

00:42:48,180 --> 00:43:01,850
priority believe that we never put

00:42:50,640 --> 00:43:19,910
necessary a one before situation

00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:19,910
situation watching query database

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:28,020
you create the PD okay what we need from

00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:30,570
the ppl that the dsm we keep defeated

00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:33,150
with just a simple screen and we came

00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:35,940
from the in screen watch until we get

00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:38,850
what connection then we get the

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,910
connection we need the query and we gain

00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:45,120
the statement then we get the statements

00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:47,760
we don't get it diminish just call it

00:43:45,120 --> 00:44:25,850
again then he configure it and then we

00:43:47,760 --> 00:44:25,850
get result actually yes you can there's

00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:32,670
another one that's based on functions

00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:35,900
closer to the collaboration would be any

00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:38,580
find work or any time you use a resource

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:41,790
fo time into the resource you use the

00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:45,890
resource to call as right it gets on

00:44:41,790 --> 00:44:45,890
your dog and close again

00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:03,750
these first because I'm others but I

00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:14,490
want to be sure that you understand

00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:22,730
business premises right here what is

00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:25,740
that the same functions just the courage

00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:28,950
you know everyone that stood out to be

00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,860
the glue or the new pastor now in 2003

00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:35,240
accepts this class and they will both

00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,620
provide us with different resolution

00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:40,740
liberal we have my generous friend is

00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:44,120
doing what kind of pattern is that can

00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,120
you imagine that kind of situation

00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:15,220
which is very wide in terms of argument

00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:17,770
because you can get file or stream or

00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,180
that ability or something that if you

00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,360
internal to the dish and then

00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:28,120
interpretation is given to celebrity and

00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:29,620
other standard that together work it

00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:32,500
needs additional application

00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,750
what kind of situation of that represent

00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,030
something that you start and the

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:42,070
beginning of that you use all the time

00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:44,050
before doing anything else with a

00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:47,170
compliment really

00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:50,290
when you complete get created or a

00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:52,480
competitor something that's initially

00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,300
asked to be available to everybody when

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,370
you start a new construct your condition

00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:59,530
which tough is nothing you cannot

00:46:56,370 --> 00:47:02,260
imagine what petitioners talking with at

00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:04,390
least one pie things because well except

00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:06,370
for scanners because if you stop me the

00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,080
tracks and everything is blocked but

00:47:06,370 --> 00:47:09,640
here we start first part and we call

00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,160
these things that will provide us to the

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,350
complete the movie now is available and

00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,540
I can use the config as a base to create

00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:19,210
the database the penetration is the

00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,980
connection and then something else and

00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:28,480
then I will have the objects interact

00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:31,200
together but I am this first step system

00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,200
of contagion

00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:38,960
this one is introducing something

00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:40,760
special this one's not from a Spanish

00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,650
coding system but that will probably

00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,080
open a you're trying to put new typing

00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,780
everywhere but here we have compared to

00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,850
the British one well we've got less

00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:51,910
classes you still have everyone we can

00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:56,390
quality time and the two others

00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:58,940
occurring each other we now want to

00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:01,960
sample something that says a calculate

00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:06,800
to be 1/3 but I calculated before engine

00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:11,530
and fax and one of those us to break the

00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:15,290
cycle that will happen when you stop

00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:17,720
after each other ok so you may say oh

00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:19,160
yeah I have to arrange the goofy so I

00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:24,680
have to pull the goofy and the computer

00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:26,480
say I need to database conditions come

00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,860
back so I have to go back to the

00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,190
database connection that the converse of

00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:34,130
a cell I need a goofy and then you're

00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:37,190
started until we actually end up again

00:48:34,130 --> 00:48:40,400
with the doctor below us you stop

00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:42,830
breaking that kind of things we are

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,630
actually our pattern is ok that's a lot

00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:46,100
that morning things but at least you

00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:48,830
will say oh yeah we will have a

00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:50,360
connection later so there you can do

00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:53,450
something give me some word formation

00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,700
I'll analyze this we probably are be

00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:58,130
something set up in a code initially

00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:02,660
that you happen as you start to these

00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:04,520
things and initially finger 1325 until

00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:06,260
you end at the moment very track

00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:09,799
we recycle and then we realize that

00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:12,619
everything stops and usually if you

00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:14,809
don't cut our system you will have at

00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:16,430
least to break one of the two back of

00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:18,920
the class will have to be instantiated

00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:20,990
before the others and from their code

00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:24,710
again from the first one so you've got

00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:29,930
the true initialization probably because

00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:33,230
they're so very good the third part is

00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:34,490
that now we can actually detect it from

00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:36,410
the outside you don't have to look at

00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:39,319
the methods in practice which has to be

00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:41,900
for the other we cannot actually take a

00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:44,299
look at that this long can we see how

00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:47,349
there are impossible situations using

00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:50,750
campaign but obviously this one is

00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:53,180
impossible everyone depends on N 1 and N

00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:56,390
1 depends on itself so you're stuck

00:49:53,180 --> 00:49:57,460
that's not going to happen if we do

00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:01,069
something wrong

00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:07,400
is this impossible solution order here

00:50:01,069 --> 00:50:09,230
two spots but we I told you that ever

00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,650
the possible function but here we

00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:16,520
actually see the dependencies and again

00:50:11,650 --> 00:50:19,099
we're going to see larger six times if

00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,990
you have more classes then maybe that

00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:23,510
kind of cycle will be here and that

00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:26,260
specific week of classes will not be

00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:26,260
available without

00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:35,080
so we made it are not all situation and

00:50:32,359 --> 00:50:37,940
I'm very open about to begin

00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,349
so but they do teach this small

00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:41,109
framework and we're going to introduce

00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:43,520
to Xstrata

00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:51,130
first classes because we were working

00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:54,940
with Russian so we have this because

00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:58,369
they have extra dependents and classes

00:50:54,940 --> 00:51:02,599
and we're going to see what happens when

00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:05,450
we build applications so here is the

00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,970
representation of the drainage fredward'

00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,660
participle of it if we actually had a

00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:10,700
task

00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:23,800
what is the main difference is we

00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:27,530
introduced the class of this to reach M

00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:29,060
becomes just be one hardness we also

00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,910
need to cover constrictor the

00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:34,040
constructor will always cause any coming

00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:36,650
William knew and we the constructor is

00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:39,470
exactly the same both of them will take

00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:42,380
arguments in those are people will tie

00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:46,220
on each other to actually make us robots

00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:48,230
to for my it's just very simple for us

00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:49,670
because see that that's in fact you want

00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:52,099
to become one you are getting two

00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:55,739
classes now one the mushrooms

00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:59,920
constructor because you cannot call in

00:51:55,739 --> 00:52:02,529
first invites depends to make the corner

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,749
little order to get to they particularly

00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:08,819
she was talking to thank you initially

00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:12,910
nothing is that mean so but then you got

00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:15,579
probably like everyone extensions and

00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:17,940
one from system overrides a one from

00:52:15,579 --> 00:52:17,940
Swan

00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:22,989
so what happens if we decide to change

00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:27,160
the argument or change the title or

00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:30,430
maybe added what is the a side effect

00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:33,940
what does HP like to do we check that

00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:36,549
the signature are people's number anti

00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:39,279
things and they for value of the same of

00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:40,599
see to announce you one believe that

00:52:39,279 --> 00:52:43,509
which we decide to change something on

00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:46,690
m1 here you will start to change the

00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:51,339
both you can imagine what will happen

00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:54,190
soon we've done the Christmas tree if I

00:52:51,339 --> 00:52:56,049
want to change something in c2 then I

00:52:54,190 --> 00:52:57,940
will have to have been c1 with c1 are

00:52:56,049 --> 00:53:00,609
going for three children try to change

00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,380
now for trusses so four methods rotate

00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:04,180
all the time things from all the classes

00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:05,859
and then I have to work with the

00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:08,680
grandparents which also ask another

00:53:05,859 --> 00:53:10,180
class depending every time I take this

00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,460
method which is obvious

00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:16,420
entry overwritten and we have to change

00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:18,400
six of them so maybe I think we'll be

00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:20,529
fine when you start adding it because

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,869
towards the moment it's fun but suddenly

00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:24,040
you realize that they will be likely to

00:53:22,869 --> 00:53:26,410
step remember

00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:28,830
evolution of people using more and more

00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:32,290
there are situation where you will be at

00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:34,150
35% you eat one of those and you have to

00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:36,430
fix all of them at the same time and

00:53:34,150 --> 00:54:00,490
you're over 35 percent to 40 people

00:53:36,430 --> 00:54:03,790
change the structure itself imposes us

00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:05,860
extra hot finish but we never clean

00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:08,950
things up we do have some point when I

00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:12,520
when you get the value and that's so we

00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:17,770
can actually replace this representation

00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:20,470
by that quitting and one be spoiling the

00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:25,170
argument for the art for the constructor

00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:25,170
and then I'll even for the matter itself

00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:33,970
we choose for this one I guess we're

00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:36,960
just having one method we have an order

00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,960
in classes

00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:13,610
[Music]

00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:28,890
[Music]

00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,390
and then at some point wind up with the

00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:32,450
same problem which is that you should

00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:35,220
include a 5/8 in through the first one

00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:37,020
and the solutions of classes of already

00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:43,859
defined you say right it's already

00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:46,319
defined so here is if we are pure word

00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:49,530
of the project we can actually take a

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:52,800
look at each and the general result so I

00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:59,640
took the previous topological order and

00:55:52,800 --> 00:56:02,069
advantage to a smaller smaller hundred

00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:05,060
classes and those kind of arrangements

00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:05,060
on our

00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,010
[Music]

00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:23,820
[Music]

00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,090
[Music]

00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:29,340
[Music]

00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:57,770
so I probably would these are support

00:57:54,440 --> 00:58:00,920
our glasses I it works so what I get I

00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:04,400
get the little of classes that are next

00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:05,960
hour before the other so they're for

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,569
reading on education still not

00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:11,599
convenient to take advantage of those

00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:14,030
maybe everyone's pollution specific

00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:21,589
namespace on his class with drop

00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:25,609
information we just quit works that's

00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:28,280
interesting and then he just to track

00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:30,950
the food and look beyond what we are and

00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:35,180
again that's pretty much research for at

00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:37,309
the moment based on the time we stop

00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:40,250
thinking about messes are just a proof

00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:42,440
of origin look at this one

00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:45,700
do you make any difference between hence

00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:45,700
one in such mine

00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:53,620
the first one says we should want to

00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:56,170
create the green class you need three

00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:58,690
arguments with different arguments which

00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:03,460
I asked the butcher at a time that will

00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:05,650
educate the second file will require on

00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:11,830
the tourism cruise trip defined the

00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:13,690
third one on annexation and still not I

00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:15,700
will actually do something different

00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:18,340
then for each small seven four but it

00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,590
will just be 12 in the blue the other

00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:22,630
part with that centers on your general

00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:24,910
property of the way story to the class

00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:28,510
and then the current III ended in to

00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:30,700
producer of their situation like that

00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:32,860
where you can see the same version

00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:38,080
method with the same argument and a

00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:39,700
different result and that is there's a

00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,830
number of situation so that's it's not

00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:44,020
going to be completely systematically

00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:46,270
the case okay I can give you right the

00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:48,430
different size of the triangle and ask

00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:55,900
you to preserve them so so still seeing

00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:58,420
the same thing about good videos or

00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,900
different ways to let exchange the same

00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:04,630
result just looking at the art with that

01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:07,870
our head to one of the methods and the

01:00:04,630 --> 01:00:10,260
result he will of yourself this part of

01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:12,450
the cone is actually

01:00:10,260 --> 01:00:14,460
the other part just very different

01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:15,720
organizations different sequence we

01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:18,600
don't mean the same value at the same

01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,160
moment but mysterious and results there

01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:24,900
may be something that can be generated

01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:27,869
or centralized and so more insight that

01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:31,560
may be more interesting reviewer have a

01:00:27,869 --> 01:00:36,840
code for our Constitution now to finish

01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:39,840
just a time my it helps not it helps a

01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:45,960
lot love 12 I'm using to stand to use

01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:48,869
them so definitely have an important

01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:50,940
impact in the growth and say it will

01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:53,609
probably be easy for the first 25

01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:58,140
percent it was so many really longer

01:00:53,609 --> 01:01:00,930
when you start from 25 to 50 once you

01:00:58,140 --> 01:01:02,700
make that me then you probably finish

01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:04,890
the rest of the typing because you've

01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:09,570
clean and made it to political order and

01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:11,580
every time it's from there's still a lot

01:01:09,570 --> 01:01:14,960
of innovation community she is

01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:20,160
interested and generates viable with

01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:22,770
with other things dimensions both tracks

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:25,170
with yourself known as the PhD group on

01:01:22,770 --> 01:01:27,150
curves or any description that's

01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:29,850
available in factors okay I'm going to

01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:33,930
use that individual push that big piece

01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:39,000
of paints or I would also say that if

01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:40,410
you just leave weekender to stuff happen

01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,600
at the moment when we stop you think

01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:45,570
okay they were so I will stop with the

01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,670
sugar of its fuse including the course

01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:50,010
and then that's probably the good moment

01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:57,570
for you to decide yeah I would be trying

01:01:50,010 --> 01:02:01,460
to those of you are interested different

01:01:57,570 --> 01:02:04,460
true that are using gravity yeah I think

01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:04,460
so

01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:16,420
[Applause]
