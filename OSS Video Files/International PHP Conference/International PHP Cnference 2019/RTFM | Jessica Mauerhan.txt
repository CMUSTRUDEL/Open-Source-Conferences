Title: RTFM | Jessica Mauerhan
Publication date: 2020-01-21
Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	There is a stereotype of programmers as being antisocial and difficult, and unfortunately many of us take on this attitude as if it comes with the job – but it doesn’t have to be this way! I know it from experience, because I’ve been an angry, judgmental know-it-all, and I’m ready to tell you how I completely changed my attitude and refactored my life.

In this talk I’ll explain how anger and fear are the root causes of our aggressive behavior, how these feelings manifest as judgmental comments online, bullying in the workplace and ultimately keep the tech community toxic and stunted. I’ll show you how embracing compassion, respect, and empathy will make you a better programmer and a happier person.
