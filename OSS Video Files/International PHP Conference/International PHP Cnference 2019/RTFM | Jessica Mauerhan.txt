Title: RTFM | Jessica Mauerhan
Publication date: 2020-01-21
Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	There is a stereotype of programmers as being antisocial and difficult, and unfortunately many of us take on this attitude as if it comes with the job – but it doesn’t have to be this way! I know it from experience, because I’ve been an angry, judgmental know-it-all, and I’m ready to tell you how I completely changed my attitude and refactored my life.

In this talk I’ll explain how anger and fear are the root causes of our aggressive behavior, how these feelings manifest as judgmental comments online, bullying in the workplace and ultimately keep the tech community toxic and stunted. I’ll show you how embracing compassion, respect, and empathy will make you a better programmer and a happier person.

[Music]

00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,570
good morning thank you everyone for

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,550
being here before we get started I just

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,360
want to draw attention to this link at

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,630
the bottom here this bitly link fit my

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,890
/rt fm/am there's a bunch of resources

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,330
there that I'm going to mention during

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,449
this talk I'm going to talk about a

00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,859
couple of blog posts and articles and

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:29,130
things like that and you can find links

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,140
to them there so I start all of my

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,329
technical talks with a slide like this

00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,670
introducing myself and handing out my

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,770
contact information and I always tell

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,540
people if you have any questions about

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,309
anything that we talked about today or

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,620
anything else that you think I could

00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:46,140
help you with please do not hesitate to

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,480
contact me I will help you or I will try

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,550
to find someone who can help you and I

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,160
do that because I love helping other

00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,980
people knowing that I was able to do

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,899
something that made someone's day better

00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:01,559
made their job easier help them grow

00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,600
make them more successful that is the

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,380
whole reason that I do this why I come

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,770
to conferences and talk but that wasn't

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,420
always true for me so I've known that I

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,460
wanted to be a programmer since I was in

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,680
high school before that I wanted to be a

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,869
math teacher so I was doing a program

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,400
that my high school offered for an

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:21,840
advanced degree in math and there was a

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,509
programming class which was a math

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,250
credit so I took it and I remember I

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,020
would come home every day excitedly

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,750
telling my dad about what I had learned

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,909
in class that day and finally one day he

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,610
said to me you know this is what you're

00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:37,439
going to do right he was a software

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,869
developer and I think that he could see

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,759
that thing in me that needed to solve

00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:46,110
problems and when I graduated I didn't

00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,180
really feel like college was right for

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,850
me so I bounced around a little bit and

00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,950
I ended up in Dallas Texas and I started

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,729
learning how to make better websites I

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,020
learned PHP I learned MySQL started

00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:00,000
learning a little JavaScript this was

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,909
back when there was like mootools and

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,700
jQuery right and I started working as a

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,979
programmer and over several years I

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,129
learned as much as I could I would jump

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,510
on any chance to learn a new technology

00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,620
the approach that I took to programming

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,599
was that literally

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,370
anything was possible you just had to

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,840
figure out how to do it so the problem

00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,200
was I didn't really know how to do it

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,760
yet but I did it well enough into to

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,629
fool people into thinking that I did

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,819
know so when people hear that I didn't

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:37,410
go to college I often get asked how I

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:39,000
learned to be a programmer a lot of the

00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,629
beginner stuff was easy for me to learn

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,430
on my own

00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,620
there's syntax there's built-in

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:45,840
functions how to use frameworks and

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:47,280
libraries a lot of that information is

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,340
well documented and it's easily

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,160
available I learned a lot through trial

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,190
and error reading blogs googling things

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,280
I also spent a lot of time on forums

00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,319
there was a PHP forum I had joined and I

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,420
became one of the top contributors often

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:05,760
answering questions about how to escape

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,579
sequel queries helping people debug

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,470
their code things like that I also

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:13,230
joined Stack Overflow and became a top

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,420
contributor on there have you ever used

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:19,440
Stack Overflow or a forum or some site

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:23,780
like that yeah have you ever gotten an

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,780
answer to a question that just said RTFM

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,299
so I like to explain RTFM to

00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,359
non-technical folks as simply read the

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:36,389
manual or as Eleanor from the good place

00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:38,549
would say read the forking manual now if

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,900
you don't get this joke please go start

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:43,280
watching the good place it's available

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,410
on Hulu I hope it's available over here

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,180
it's a great show the premise of the

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,489
show is that the main character Eleanor

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,169
has died and she's been accidentally

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,230
sent to the good place even though she's

00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,730
a horrible person um she often tries to

00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:59,480
curse but of course you can't curse in

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:03,810
the good place so she says forking a lot

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,970
anyway sometimes RTFM is all you get as

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:08,329
an answer sometimes it's more detailed

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,220
with a link to the documentation

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:14,130
sometimes it's in the form of google it

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:17,430
or look it up sometimes it's a lot

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,769
harsher right people who answer

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,389
questions this way often defend it

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,400
saying that they're actually trying to

00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,250
help that person learn how to ask better

00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:27,720
questions do more research on their own

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,670
right

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,070
there's a little bit of truth to that in

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,290
that if you know you're not going to get

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,210
help or you'll be made fun of for asking

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,370
you're less likely to ask that question

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:40,290
so you might spend a lot more time

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,360
trying to figure it out banging your

00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:46,070
head against the wall maybe you'll give

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,070
up maybe you'll stop asking questions

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,660
these sites actually have a ton of

00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,640
knowledge right the best-case scenario

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,080
is that you search for your question and

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,990
it's already been answered by someone

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,600
else and then you don't have to be the

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,610
one to ask it sometimes unfortunately

00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,700
you have to ask and sometimes you never

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:08,400
get an answer but sometimes you do get

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,840
answers and you can learn something and

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,130
that's what happened for me most of the

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,480
time but besides the knowledge there is

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,970
something else that we find on these

00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,790
forums and I think it's a symptom of a

00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:23,520
cultural problem that exists not just on

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,040
Stack Overflow or Twitter or slack

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,410
spaces or wherever we're gathering

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:32,610
online it's a problem with the entire

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,530
tech community this is a screenshot of a

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:36,660
Google search that I did in an incognito

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:41,010
window so it is not influenced by my

00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,200
search history it says I've typed why

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:46,050
are programmers and the autocomplete is

00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:49,260
suggesting things including so rude

00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:53,460
socially awkward so arrogant such

00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:57,090
douchebags this is what people think of

00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:00,360
when they imagine a programmer the

00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:03,930
antisocial condescending attitude that

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:06,590
tells people to RTFM that mocks people

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,000
who call HTML a programming language I

00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:11,970
don't think this is a shock to any of us

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,950
right we know this is how the rest of

00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,020
the world thinks about us and it's how

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:20,220
we think of ourselves a lot of the time

00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,650
a friend of mine suggested on Twitter

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,280
that conferences should have a code of

00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:29,310
conduct and someone responded this way

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,160
you demand too much from nerds that lost

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:36,140
a lot of social skills as a trade-off to

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,190
be good think about that this person

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:40,919
they're not saying they're concerned

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,060
about a code of conduct being misused by

00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:43,950
bad actor

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,860
they're not concerned about freedom of

00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:50,160
expression or something like that they

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,290
are saying that we are not capable of

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,890
treating each other with respect and

00:06:52,290 --> 00:07:00,270
kindness because it's incompatible with

00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,520
being good technologists in the tech

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,030
community we have too long accepted this

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:11,940
as a given the programmers are just

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:14,070
shitty human beings and we see this

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,920
behavior in tech leaders all the time

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:20,250
some of the biggest names in tech have

00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:22,070
reputations for being jerks a prominent

00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,350
example is Linux creator Linus Torvalds

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,820
who has been known for his rude behavior

00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,260
profanity and personal outburst for

00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:33,210
years there is an entire subreddit

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,760
dedicated to his rants and outbursts on

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,890
the Linux kernel mailing list a New

00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,220
Yorker article highlighted Torvalds

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,600
approach the emails of the celebrated

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,880
programmer Linus Torvalds

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,300
land like Thunder bolts from on high on

00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,700
two public lists full of invective

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,340
insults and demeaning language please

00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,140
just kill yourself now the world will be

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,140
a better place he wrote in one

00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,340
so tour boats has defended his style for

00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,920
years saying that's just who he is he

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,230
despises being nice he doesn't believe

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,920
in political correctness he's not

00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,780
empathetic and that since his culture

00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,700
includes cursing telling him not to

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,750
curse at people is being insensitive to

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:27,420
him now he's been successfully managing

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:30,480
the Linux kernel development for twenty

00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:32,520
years more than that now and he's argued

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:38,550
that his no-bullshit approach has made

00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:40,380
him successful maybe it is working but

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,940
it's definitely kept some people from

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,700
wanting to contribute to that project

00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,830
and it's promoted this idea that

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:50,460
technical communities are full of

00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:52,970
condescending jerks and it's not just

00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:56,070
him this attitude exists all over I

00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:58,670
mentioned using a PHP forum earlier and

00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,220
I've pulled a quote from a post there oh

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:05,220
and by the way I don't come here to help

00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,140
ungrateful whiny babies so stop acting

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,630
like a child and remember this is a free

00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,460
help forum way to ensure you won't get

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,230
my help again this is why I don't

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,730
usually write code for people they act

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:17,670
like even when you give them

00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,080
what you what they want does that sound

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,340
like someone who's actually trying to

00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:28,020
help that person that was me I wrote

00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,750
that in 2013 I resented customers who

00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,210
asked stupid questions I picked on my

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,880
co-workers who annoyed me for stupid

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,970
reasons and I criticized their code for

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,610
equally stupid reasons I would talk with

00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,240
the other programmers about what idiots

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,910
basically everyone else was I worked at

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:50,130
a company with a manual QA team overseas

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,570
at one point and I remember seeing them

00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:55,520
as the enemy like who did they think

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:58,050
they were to find bugs in my code I

00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:01,590
remember I had one co-worker who wanted

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,150
to introduce unit testing and I refused

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:05,550
to even consider or listen to his

00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,020
arguments which is probably pretty

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,810
shocking to anyone who works with me now

00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,610
and by the way I'm doing a session later

00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:12,750
about test-driven development and

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:14,310
behavior driven development

00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,420
I love TDD tests

00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,490
life so please come see that later so in

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,770
reality as far as my technical skills

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,260
were concerned I was on the expert

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,770
beginner stage of my growth as developer

00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,690
in his blog post titled how developers

00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,270
stop learning rise of the expert

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,010
beginner Eric Dietrich explains how he

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:37,529
learned to bull not by actually putting

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,910
his fingers in the bowling ball but kind

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,490
of just holding it and chucking it down

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:45,540
the lane and he got pretty good at doing

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,610
that way until he stopped improving Eric

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,910
writes how his manager explained to him

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,920
how he could improve there's nothing you

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,940
can do to improve as long as you keep

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,730
bowling like that

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:58,170
you've maxed out if you want to get

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:00,270
better you're going to have to learn how

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,460
to bowl properly you need a different

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,260
ball a different style of throwing it

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,589
and you need to put your fingers in it

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,390
like a big boy the worst part is you're

00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:10,950
going to get worse before you get better

00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:13,500
and there will be a good bit of time

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,860
before you get back to and surpass your

00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,720
current average Eric goes on to explain

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,240
the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,820
and how when one can quickly learn

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,500
skills in an isolated environment they

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,420
can get stuck in this offshoot phase

00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,180
that stalls their development called the

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:34,080
expert beginner for years I worked like

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,970
this writing code those okay because

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,190
someone gave me a task in some project

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,720
management software and constantly being

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,930
angry at everyone who asked me for

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,930
anything

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,839
in April of 2014

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,959
my boss said we were going to a PHP

00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,230
conference and I didn't even know such a

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,570
thing existed I was honestly not super

00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,870
excited about having to be around that

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,360
many people I didn't know I've never

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,190
been really great with strangers like my

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,959
nightmare is when I'm at the

00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,390
self-checkout and the cashier comes over

00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,950
to talk to me right because I'm like I

00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:19,190
have my earbuds in I don't want to talk

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,170
to you and there's plenty of times that

00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,250
I don't necessarily want to talk to the

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,779
people that I know and love so anyway we

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,390
went to the conference and it was this

00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:32,060
amazing experience of listening to

00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,330
people explaining technology and how I

00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,120
could use it and it was okay that I

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,830
didn't already know how to do that

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,170
everyone was really encouraging and it

00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,810
was just a lot of fun overall and this

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,029
is a photo of me and Adam Culp who's

00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,990
another conference organizer and he used

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:50,420
to work for Zent

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,540
and I wanted drawing to get this big

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:54,620
Zend PTP elephant and I was extra

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,990
grouchy because I was like eight months

00:12:54,620 --> 00:13:00,829
pregnant at this time but it was still a

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:04,399
fun conference we went back to the

00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:06,410
Lonestar again the next year 2015 and in

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,899
between the sessions I got to talk to

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,940
Ben Ramsay now Ben has done and

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,829
continues to do a lot of work in the PHP

00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:14,750
community including organizing

00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:17,660
conferences and user groups and writing

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:19,459
really popular libraries so I remember

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,950
talking to him and I said something

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:23,959
along the lines of it's so cool that you

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:26,480
get to do this I wish I could do this

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:29,390
sort of thing and he said something like

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:34,399
you can everyone has something they can

00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:36,649
share it was totally okay that I didn't

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,209
know so much of this information and

00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,760
there were all these people who wanted

00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:42,459
to share and they did it in a way that

00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,079
didn't make me feel like an idiot

00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:48,709
they were encouraging me to be a part of

00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:51,290
it at some point I had to start thinking

00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:53,329
about what it meant when someone else

00:13:51,290 --> 00:14:00,950
didn't know some piece of information

00:13:53,329 --> 00:14:03,470
that I did one evening in December of

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,590
20:16 I got a text message from a friend

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:09,230
of mine his text said do you know how to

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,570
make an android app I responded in

00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,730
theory guess I figured I could probably

00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,680
figure it out right I thought he had

00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:21,020
some business idea maybe he wants to

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,240
make the next flappy bird right and then

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:27,140
my friend responded and he spent the

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,390
next hour texting with me and he told me

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,080
how his friends 18 year old daughter had

00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:34,880
been in a coma and had just woken up a

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,700
month prior she had had an arterial

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,680
venous malformation which is a tangle of

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,440
abnormal blood vessels connecting

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,030
arteries and veins in your brain and two

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,850
hours after that she had life-saving

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:49,010
surgery to remove a portion of her brain

00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,870
the size of a kiwi fruit in order to

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:59,420
stop the swelling and bleeding and she

00:14:50,870 --> 00:15:01,580
was in a coma for 31 days when she woke

00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,410
up from the coma the only thing she

00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:07,180
could do was blink she couldn't move

00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:10,040
anything else and they were not eligible

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,530
to get the fancy eye tracking software

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:15,230
and hardware that would have made it

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,970
possible for her to communicate they

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,410
were communicating entirely through

00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:23,630
blink once for yes and twice for no her

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,200
family had to guess at things that she

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,500
might want

00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:30,730
she had no ways to tell them I'm thirsty

00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:35,030
or my head hurts or I want to watch TV

00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:37,370
and they had no way of knowing if she

00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,680
was even capable of understanding these

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:46,160
thoughts anymore let alone communicating

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:48,410
them so my friend asked me could I make

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,390
an app for him that would just cycle

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,910
through the alphabet so that she could

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:55,880
blink at the letter she wanted and spell

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,280
words and I told him okay I can't make

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,720
an Android app not right now but I can

00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:05,660
make you a website that work so I sat

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,090
down and I spent 45 minutes making an

00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:11,570
app in view and it just let you swipe

00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:14,540
through the alphabet they liked it I

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:18,410
threw the generated files onto Amazon s3

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:20,180
and sent him the URL and for several

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,579
weeks they were able to use that site to

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,220
communicate while Livia recovered and

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:28,130
went through physical therapy a few

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,810
months later she was walking again she

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:32,800
still has a lot of recovery ahead of her

00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:38,540
but she's doing really good now

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,459
so there I was spending 45 minutes to

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,410
create something in a new language I

00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,930
didn't know I was not a JavaScript

00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,639
developer I had not used vo but it

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,639
seemed like an easy way to make this I

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:55,089
wrote horrible code that my friend and

00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:57,880
developer friends would have made fun of

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,410
for someone that I didn't even know

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:07,160
without knowing if it actually would

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:10,130
help because it might so why couldn't I

00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,860
spend five extra minutes to do good code

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:16,280
review to write thoughtful comments that

00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:18,500
would help the people around me why was

00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:21,339
I so angry at people who had done

00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:25,970
nothing but ask for my help

00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:30,140
or simply exist in the same world around

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:32,540
me why did I resent the people who used

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,760
the products that I built and get

00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,750
annoyed that they didn't understand how

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:41,270
software works there's something that

00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:44,299
makes it so obvious that Livia was

00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:47,120
deserving of my help and I guess it

00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:53,630
wasn't so obvious at first that everyone

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:56,270
deserve that I was stuck on the expert

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,660
beginner stage of being a basic human

00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:02,480
adult being just like Eric had to

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,490
relearn how to bowl properly I needed to

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,770
relearn how to treat the people around

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:10,940
me I needed a different style of

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:13,970
throwing the ball I wasn't trying to be

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,340
an I wasn't as another tweet I

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,830
saw recently said waking up every day

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:24,770
and deciding to with everyone it

00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:27,020
wasn't a deliberate choice the upgrade

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,870
by the life hacker did an episode called

00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,090
how

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,820
not be a dick where they interviewed a

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,000
former childhood bully named Jeffrey in

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,430
the interview Jeffrey mentioned several

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,460
times about how angry he was as a

00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:44,880
teenager he describes being as young as

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:47,430
five years old playing baseball and he

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,860
could pitch a perfect game but the team

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:52,320
still lost by one point so he would lock

00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:54,059
himself in the room and cry because he

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,020
felt an intense pressure to be perfect

00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:00,179
in the interview he says I didn't come

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,660
home every day and think wow I'm a bully

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:05,520
I thought I'm cool I'm great I'm a tough

00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:08,520
guy and don't mess with me because I'll

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,610
start a fight with you the victim of

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,309
Jeffrey's bullying Eric chimes in to

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:16,890
describe how he felt like Jeffrey was a

00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:19,890
giant because of how aggressive he was

00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:23,460
but in reality eric was about a foot

00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,550
taller as the interview goes on Jeffery

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,780
explains how he later had to ask himself

00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:33,870
why am I so angry we get angry at people

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:37,140
who ask bad questions because they're

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,700
wasting our time we get angry that

00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,400
they're not working as hard as we think

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,890
they should be we're angry at people who

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,840
challenge the way we do things we're

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:50,910
angry at people that we think are some

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,820
kind of a threat anger is usually a

00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:58,380
secondary emotion meaning it stems from

00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:03,450
another emotion entirely behind a lot of

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,490
this anger is fear we naturally try to

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:09,390
fight the things that we are most

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:12,750
insecure about sometimes pointing out

00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:14,960
that we know the answer makes us feel

00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:19,860
better about our unacknowledged fear

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,080
that we don't know other answers in the

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,960
interview Jeffery describes his fear of

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,050
not being good enough even when he

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:31,559
succeeded if it wasn't good enough if it

00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:34,890
wasn't perfect he still felt fear and

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:37,640
guilt sometimes when we tell other

00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:40,770
people it's easy just read the manual

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,700
what we're really saying is I need to

00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:44,100
convince myself

00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,730
it's easy all you have to do is read the

00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:49,650
manual because I'm scared to admit that

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,720
there aren't always easy answers

00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:54,600
sometimes we're unintentionally pointing

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,730
out how much smarter than we we are than

00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:03,480
the question asker by using words like

00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:05,520
simple just easy we can alleviate a lot

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,610
of this fear and anger by substituting

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,200
it with empathy now I was not raised in

00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:12,000
an environment where empathy was

00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,260
encouraged I don't think it was

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,180
something that I had ever even heard

00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,090
people talk about until a couple years

00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,300
ago when I saw Samantha quinones talk

00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:22,920
about empathy and it would be easy for

00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:25,590
me to say that because I wasn't raised

00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,510
with this as an important value that

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,400
it's not my fault that I didn't get it

00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:32,730
and I could have kept using that excuse

00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,280
to defend my behavior but after seeing

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:38,100
other people practicing empathy in their

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,320
everyday lives and seeing examples of

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,450
successful people who are making a

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,480
difference and living without that

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,940
constant fear and anger I had to

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,880
acknowledge that I had a problem and it

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:54,240
was possible to be both a good developer

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:58,320
and a kinder respectful compassionate

00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,750
person I know I've never been satisfied

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,320
seeing a problem go unsolved and I saw a

00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:05,960
problem in my own behavior and the same

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
thing happened for linus torvalds I

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,900
spoke earlier about how he has been an

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,450
example of some of the negative

00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,240
stereotypes of programmers last year

00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:18,300
turbos made a surprising announcement

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,700
when after he accidentally created some

00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:23,130
scheduling conflicts to avoid the yearly

00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,220
Linux kernel summit he was confronted by

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:29,280
his community about his behavior

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:31,050
Torvalds wrote this week people in our

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,900
community confronted me about my

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,430
lifetime of not understanding emotions

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,490
my flippant attacks and emails have been

00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,360
both unprofessional and uncalled for

00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,940
especially at times when I made it

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,820
personal in my quest for a better patch

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:50,730
this made sense to me I now know this

00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:52,830
was not okay and I'm truly sorry there's

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,420
a comedy podcast I listened to called my

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,590
brother and my brother in me and it's

00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,049
hosted by Justin

00:22:55,590 --> 00:23:01,940
as in Griffin McElroy and they actually

00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:01,940
taught me a lot about respecting people

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,110
when they first started their show they

00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,720
were just messing around and they made a

00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:11,669
lot of jokes that didn't age well in

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,190
particular in one episode they made a

00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:16,350
joke about furries and then they were

00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:19,799
pretty mean in an attempt to be funny

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:22,470
and then they got letters from some of

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,630
their listeners saying hey I really like

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:29,159
you guys but I'm a furry and what you

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:31,200
said really hurt my feelings so they had

00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,330
two choices at that point they could be

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,610
defensive and pull that whole it's just

00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:39,870
a joke lighten up right

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:42,270
or they could apologize admit they were

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:46,470
insensitive and change their behavior

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:48,270
and they chose the second option they

00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:50,549
apologized and they started making an

00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:52,380
effort to be more empathetic they grew

00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:54,390
as comedians and they created and

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,580
nurtured this amazing welcoming

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,919
inclusive community based around

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,169
encouragement and comedy that isn't

00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,270
cruel and they went on to grow that

00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:05,700
podcast into a TV show they have several

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,700
spin-off podcasts they do national tours

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,010
and they recently had the graphic novel

00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,360
adaptation of one of their shows be

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,210
number one on the New York Times

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,559
bestseller list

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:19,020
Justin McElroy published a blog post

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,360
several years ago titled

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:24,659
what it has taken me 33 years to learn

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,649
and the first item on the list is you

00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:30,659
can be funny and kind or funny and cruel

00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:33,720
the second one is easier but the first

00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:36,149
one is worth it so for me I had to learn

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,549
that I can be a programmer and be cruel

00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:40,980
to the people around me or I can be a

00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:44,970
programmer and be respectful kind

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,640
helpful and encouraging and it's

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,710
actually not easier to be mean maybe it

00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,510
isn't comedy but not in our regular

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,970
lives

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:56,580
it might seem like it is at first but I

00:24:53,970 --> 00:25:00,539
was hurting myself and the people around

00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:03,299
me it's easier to be kind even if it

00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:05,399
means I take three times as long to

00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:07,500
write a response to a customer because

00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:09,240
instead of just linking them to the

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,160
documentation

00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,750
look at their site find the settings

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,900
they have enabled for the plug-in that

00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,090
we have send them a running code snippet

00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,370
of the changes they'll need to make it's

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:26,940
easier it's better in the long run for

00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:28,950
me and for them the post that I

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:31,370
mentioned from the PHP forum in that

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,900
last post that I ever made on there I

00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:38,730
solved their problem that day I gave

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:40,920
them code I helped them but what do you

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,530
think that they walked away from that

00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,320
thinking about me and about the

00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:48,240
programming community what was the

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,700
overall sum of positive and negative

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,350
effects that went out into the world

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:57,810
because of that exchange what about my

00:25:55,350 --> 00:26:00,000
recent email to my customer where I help

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,540
them without needing to imply that they

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,850
were an idiot

00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:06,300
which would be absolutely unacceptable

00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:07,890
in any professional situation but it

00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,720
still happens there's a reason though a

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:15,750
lot of programmers aren't allowed to

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:19,650
talk to customers when I had a chance

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:22,440
there I practiced empathy I understood

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,690
how much time and effort this customer

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,580
had put into fixing his site and I knew

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:28,950
how frustrating it was and how helpless

00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,780
he felt when he finally had to ask us to

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,460
fix it

00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:34,400
now I'm not trying to say that I'm

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:37,740
perfect I still make a lot of mistakes

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,930
we don't have to be perfect but we have

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,260
to get rid of this idea that programmers

00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:45,420
are hostile jerks we have to start

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:49,470
treating each other with more respect

00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:51,270
and empathy now most of the time when we

00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:54,330
talk about empathy we're referring to

00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:57,300
what's known as emotional or affective

00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,700
empathy which means being able to

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,270
respond to someone else's emotions with

00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:05,760
an appropriate emotion there's another

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,850
aspect of empathy known as cognitive

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,480
empathy or the ability to understand

00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:14,070
another person's perspective I think a

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,360
lot of the conflict that we deal with

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:22,200
could be reduced at least in part if we

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,800
work on our cognitive empathy so often

00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,260
we don't

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,630
the time to put ourselves in other

00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:30,660
people's shoes and it's easier to

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,600
dismiss them when we don't empathize

00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:36,330
with their experiences it can be really

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,910
hard to understand just how different

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:43,350
other people's experiences have been

00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:46,470
from our own so we don't try it's easier

00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:48,330
to dismiss it I want to try and

00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:52,290
experiment and I would like everyone to

00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:54,920
close their eyes I want you to imagine

00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:58,800
yourself on a beach

00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:01,260
imagine the blue-green waves crashing

00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:04,500
against the shore imagine your toes

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,780
digging into the whites and think about

00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,210
the sounds of seagulls flying overhead

00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:11,570
looking for food

00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:14,070
think about the smell of the salt water

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:16,980
maybe there's beautiful palm trees on

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,250
your beach or a fire pit in the sand or

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,950
folks are making s'mores alright open

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:25,490
your eyes I want you to raise your hand

00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:28,320
if you would use the words pictured or

00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:33,030
visualized to describe what you just did

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:37,800
if in your mind you saw yourself on a

00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:39,690
beach maybe it looked like this one my

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:43,560
husband says he pictures the beach from

00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:45,210
the movie contact maybe some of you

00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,760
would even say you smelled the salt

00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:51,480
water or the fire pit or you heard the

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,690
sounds of the waves or the seagulls this

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,080
is what I see there is no such thing as

00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:02,610
visualization for me I have no mind's

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,440
eye this is it I have a Fantasia which

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:07,440
is the inability to produce visual

00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:09,720
images in my mind I don't have any other

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,180
senses in my mind conversations in my

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,540
head are only in my voice there is no

00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,220
smell or taste in my mind there's a part

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,130
of your brain that lights up on an MRI

00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:22,890
when you see an image and the same part

00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,770
lights up when you picture an image in

00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:29,160
your mind unless you have a Fantasia and

00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:31,410
cannot picture things now I didn't find

00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,780
this out until last year when a friend

00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:35,820
of mine a co-worker shared an article

00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,480
about a Fantasia and I had to start

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,640
asking my

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,470
friends if they really could see things

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,660
in their mind I had gone my whole life

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,970
so far thinking everyone was just being

00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,340
super metaphorical when they talked

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:52,470
about visualization and I didn't

00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:55,640
understand the vast majority of people

00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:58,320
mean that they actually picture things

00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,530
until I read about the two percent of

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,940
people who don't picture things so when

00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:06,270
I figured this out and made a lot of

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,890
sense for me um and it kind of explained

00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,660
like why I thought flowery language

00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:14,549
describing scenes and novels was silly

00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:16,260
but my friends couldn't understand what

00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:17,669
I was going through my friends would ask

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,429
me like do you mean you just see black

00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:22,080
and white like no absolutely no picture

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:25,919
this is what I see when I close my eyes

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,929
it's the back of my eyelids so to so

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,360
many people the experience of not being

00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:32,280
able to visualize things is unimaginable

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,950
they cannot put themselves in my shoes

00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,380
any more than I can close my eyes and

00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,240
picture myself on the beach but I can

00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,340
think about the beach all right when I

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,400
imagine things I don't see them but I

00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,780
know what they look like is my daughter

00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:49,410
on a beach I just wanted to share this

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:51,510
picture cuz the super cute so I will

00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,860
never see that picture in my head like I

00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:53,490
know what her face looks like but I

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,919
can't see it

00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:58,620
so we're talking about something that

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,840
honestly has very little impact I was

00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:02,520
able to go 32 years of my life without

00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,669
realizing that my brain worked

00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,020
differently than 98% of people's so it

00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:09,570
wasn't keeping me from doing anything

00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:11,220
important so when my friends are not

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:14,790
able to understand what I mean when I

00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,049
say I see nothing it doesn't matter how

00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:18,510
do we handle it when it's something that

00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:20,340
does matter do we just miss that

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,290
person's experience because we can't put

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,669
ourselves in their position because we

00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:27,059
have no context for what they've gone

00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:28,260
through we're going to skip ahead a

00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:34,169
little bit because I ran out of time

00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:35,880
sorry folks so I would love it if you

00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:38,250
could go and read that post that Justin

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,140
Mac or I wrote about things that has

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,830
taken him a long time to learn there's a

00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,260
lot of great stuff on there in the links

00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,230
that are in the bitly link there's tons

00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:50,370
of good resources so I just want to wrap

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,679
up by saying

00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:55,470
it's okay if you still don't like

00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:57,299
talking to people I don't I'm always

00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,520
happy to talk to anyone at conferences

00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:01,770
anyone who emails me but I still have

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,240
anxiety I don't like it when that

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,159
cashier talks to me at the checkout

00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,809
because like I said I have both of my

00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,169
earbuds and why are you trying to talk

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:11,549
to me it's the self-checkout I don't

00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:13,799
know maybe she's trying to do it because

00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:14,970
her boss makes her maybe her kids all

00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,710
moved away and she doesn't have anyone

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:18,659
to talk to

00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,690
it doesn't help anything for me to be

00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:25,140
mean to her or angry about it it doesn't

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:28,830
solve any problems and solving problems

00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,659
is why I got into programming to solve

00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,210
problems for people and I forgot about

00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:35,250
that for a while that the Paycheck only

00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:39,320
keeps coming because the code I'm

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:42,169
writing is solving a problem for someone

00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:47,070
the lack of empathy understanding

00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:50,100
respect compassion community in tech is

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:52,409
a problem and we are all responsible for

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,529
solving it with the software that we

00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:57,870
write the tickets we respond to the

00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:00,600
jokes we make and the actions that we

00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:03,630
take every day we are making changes in

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,029
the world and we are responsible for

00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:08,240
making things better so let's go do it

00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,670
thank you very much

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,750
[Applause]

00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:13,940
[Music]

00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,940
