Title: CQRS and Event Sourcing | Oliver Sturm
Publication date: 2020-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	Data storage and data access are subjects of this talk. CQRS is quite a simple pattern to split responsibilities when working with data, but incredibly complicated papers have been written about it! Event Sourcing can be viewed as a natural extension of CQRS, though in reality a decision for or against it is independent and comes with its own consequences. Oliver uses practical examples in this talk to demonstrate implementation and combination of both patterns.
