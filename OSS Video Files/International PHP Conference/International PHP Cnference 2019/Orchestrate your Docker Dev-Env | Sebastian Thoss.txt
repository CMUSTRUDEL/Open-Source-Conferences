Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: International PHP Cnference 2019
Description: 
	Do you have several repositories which use Docker, like us? Now they need to talk to each other on your local computer to be able to develop features which live in more than one repository. Today, I want to show you how we solved the problem. We orchestrate our Docker Dev-Env just with simple shell scripts, the support of a proxy image and some simple rules for every project. Let me show you how easy it is to build a Docker Dev-Env and how fast it will be to introduce additional projects.
