"It’s not personal” but it so is! Code reviews are still one of the biggest sources of conflict in a team and can delay value delivery by days if not weeks. I’d like to tell you why that is but more importantly hand you a method that will let you focus on what’s important: the work. We briefly touch on the psychological mechanics at work during PRs, look at statistics to fuel decisions around commenting, and then combine those two perspectives to create a solid code review etiquette for your team so you can achieve truly async non-blocking code reviews.
