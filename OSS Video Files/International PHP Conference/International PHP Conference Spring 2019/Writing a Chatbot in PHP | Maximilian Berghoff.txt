Title: Writing a Chatbot in PHP | Maximilian Berghoff
Publication date: 2019-10-10
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Maximilian Berghoff (Mayflower GmbH) | https://phpconference.com/speaker/maximilian-berghoff/

You can do everything you want in PHP. So why not write a chatbot in PHP? It isn’t easy, but I showed it several times before. There are possibilities to integrate Natural Language Understanding tools like RASA NLU in a PHP Application. There are also libraries to run PHP asynchronous, that means also in a reactive way. So then let us do it and build a chatbot in PHP.

00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:11,250
justjust for the beginning ham this is

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:14,219
me at this picture is nearly 8 years ago

00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,190
because no seven my method is getting

00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:20,520
seven eight this year and this was his

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,189
first birthday and this was was less

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,490
beard I think it because it's seven

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,980
years ago my name is Maximilian back off

00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,740
my Twitter handle or my handle all over

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:35,640
the world is electric max it comes a

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,960
little bit from from my music favor and

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:42,750
you see it up is the same when I'm not

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,329
doing those stuff I'm working for some

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:48,629
simply components and I'm creating I'm

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,340
in maintainer for a symphony library to

00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:56,640
create CMS applications or to bathe CMS

00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:00,390
applications from from from blocks and

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,920
it's called symphonies EMF my email is

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,400
if you've got more questions or

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,680
questions that are longer than 100 to 80

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,780
no we are 280 science and as air can see

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,240
I'm working from Mayflower it's a

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,689
company with three bases in Germany I

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:25,049
work in red spot we also are located

00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:27,810
here in Berlin and Munich so let's start

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,470
a little bit yeah I promised I would

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:33,210
create a shed pot in PHP I know that

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,610
they are asked shed pots of PHP but

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,350
before starting with it we shouldn't

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,640
mention the question why doing it to PHP

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:45,570
because HP is really limited and lots of

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:50,310
situations we we running it a serpent's

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:53,579
Lee isn't that that easy but it's a PHP

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:57,479
conference and I work with speech P for

00:01:53,579 --> 00:02:00,540
more than o for nearly 20 years now I

00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:07,399
think so this is beer disorder than you

00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:11,090
think and yeah and why not trying it in

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:11,090
in the tool we

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:23,030
and we have in front of us every day I

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:27,989
need some water is between two yeah

00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:33,450
so when having a look at Google and it

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:36,750
was my first first approach after after

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:39,360
getting the story accepted I have found

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,769
a lot of the check box of peach peas

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,379
there are there are lots of examples

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:46,980
lots of examples which which are going

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,450
through different API is which are

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:53,099
connected to Facebook which are

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:58,049
connected to our kind of our kind of

00:02:53,099 --> 00:03:02,940
share systems but what single one was

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:06,569
missing one was separate or was was a

00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,819
singer and a you or an AP integration

00:03:06,569 --> 00:03:12,329
and this is was the reason I proposed

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:17,400
his talk and because as I said before I

00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:20,910
I created one in PHP for just for some

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,760
experiments but it works or it worked so

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:29,459
I hope it will work later or so and yeah

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,310
but one of these examples which I found

00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:37,560
really interesting was for sea bottom

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:40,620
and from it's it's Lara it's written a

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,560
lot of it and if it's a simply guy I'm

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,230
not very familiar with laravel but I set

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,700
it up it works and we can have a look at

00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:53,040
it because it brings up see easy the

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,780
basic features we where needings it

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,620
brings up some kind of medieval

00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:01,459
architecture to to to to start a

00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,560
conversation to hear on messages or

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:08,340
something else so we can have a look at

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:13,400
it and see installation is quite easy

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,959
because you only have to install some

00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,709
some pathos and the rest is done by

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:24,770
composer and you get something like Oh

00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:24,770
where's my coat my coat is to you

00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,999
[Music]

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:41,600
no I don't want to share the code I want

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:45,680
to share the the I will share the result

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,410
as well as I'd you get a simple is this

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,470
just a demonstration it's a it's an

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:54,380
input field and there I can type and

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:58,310
some things like hi and I get an answer

00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:03,950
this answer isn't really intelligent is

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:08,690
just just based on code it's just just

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:11,540
just a comparison on strings so this is

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,150
the reason I want to where's my codes

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,640
asymptote

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,750
I wouldn't wish to have a some kind of

00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:24,260
mirror screen do I see here is the same

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:30,380
like I have there oh it's cool it's just

00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:44,300
a little bit small but so this is the

00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:47,530
right code this one oh yeah that would

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:52,190
be oh oh I go to into the white mode

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:59,410
because my body is white this is really

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:59,410
I can switch I give it you back to

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:08,630
presentation mode no I think we have to

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,080
switch off the lights because I can't do

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,080
it at the moment

00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:38,190
come on appearance it's really hard to

00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:40,580
make a IDE if I contrast Oh what I

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,580
wanted

00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,510
I think the Kelly J one yeah this one

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,060
should work except the accept see convoy

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:13,139
and you see it here and I hopefully see

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:19,740
it there and I do it here the coat is

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:26,640
white we've got

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:30,720
just this it's just object-oriented or

00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:34,980
pre version two to match the answers we

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:39,590
can at some some more specific stuff we

00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:43,770
can add arguments if you would like to

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:52,800
or give it now just need something to

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:55,620
copy here and but as I said it's this is

00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:03,060
not really intelligent here at the

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:08,790
moment and so even this one here if I

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:11,940
paste something like this one I can get

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:18,180
arguments inside of average or if I'd

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:22,550
like to do with paste both we could do

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:25,590
regular expressions which they're a

00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:30,600
little bit more than just comparing

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:38,550
strings so and if we go back to our

00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:44,090
application we move that back and I say

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:44,090
call me max

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:50,730
I I guess the answer because it's

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:54,510
justjust just a match on the strings and

00:08:50,730 --> 00:09:01,020
arguments were recognized and we could

00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:07,790
do we can do yeah some some string stuff

00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:10,710
and this this spot framework overcoat so

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,770
also has a possibility to start a

00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:18,770
conversation and to to follow a

00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:27,720
conversation and this one can be done by

00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:29,580
start conversation and oh can be very

00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,640
complicated because the last joke I try

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:42,390
it was wasn't really it was too dirty I

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:43,980
think oh it's okay so it's it's a it's

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:45,060
it's a kind of conversation you you

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,770
prepare buttons

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:53,220
most of the the chat system who you are

00:09:49,770 --> 00:10:00,750
addicted to will do their own

00:09:53,220 --> 00:10:04,980
representation from it and yeah oh it's

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:14,720
getting dark so I hope we get some light

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:18,200
because it's good to see it here just

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,200
looking for my

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,620
so what I what I'm reading here is

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:31,450
basically a topic for tomorrow but but

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:33,700
these talks are orientated in the wrong

00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:36,510
direction because I want to explain a

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:40,300
little bit about what NLU is because

00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,340
this is a point where we where we where

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,770
we try to get some intelligence into the

00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:47,170
into the reclamation because at the

00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:53,890
moment it's a just string comparisons or

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:57,310
just stupid stupid checks here so why am

00:10:53,890 --> 00:11:01,450
i image loading here and I hope it will

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:03,580
work later we will go into some basics

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,950
for me to talk to tomorrow so you don't

00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:13,170
have to wake up this early because uh

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:13,170
having it not isn't that

00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:47,049
echinacea so just to skip this one is

00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:49,809
just and the use is it's quite similar

00:11:47,049 --> 00:11:52,329
to MLP but it's not the same it's just

00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:55,589
the understanding of the language the

00:11:52,329 --> 00:12:01,600
understanding of of a sentence if I say

00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:05,230
something making sentences is very human

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,439
and to understand them it's mostly a

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,739
human feature too and some humans me

00:12:08,439 --> 00:12:13,569
included adds a good into an

00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:15,819
understanding sentences or in

00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:18,639
understanding underlying meanings

00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:22,559
because this is a percentage I have to

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:26,189
stay at home after Friday says a lot

00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:30,759
there are a lot of different meanings

00:12:26,189 --> 00:12:32,199
the context is really important to let

00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:37,360
you understand different meanings here

00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:42,669
and what we use here is to this some

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:48,399
kind of machine learning and one one

00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:52,119
basic thing is office NAU is to to to to

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:54,429
get the intent and the intent is see

00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:57,369
what what is what is what is meant by

00:12:54,429 --> 00:13:04,689
the sentence so and this is something we

00:12:57,369 --> 00:13:11,439
can train a model and we can we can we

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:15,179
can yeah so another thing is this is a

00:13:11,439 --> 00:13:19,209
kind of an entity because I've had this

00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:23,049
sentence here if I try to train a bot

00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:28,169
which makes illness reports it's what my

00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:30,669
first example I want to make my HR

00:13:28,169 --> 00:13:33,669
section happy and I want to make in its

00:13:30,669 --> 00:13:35,649
reports and Sheth so somebody is say say

00:13:33,669 --> 00:13:39,600
I'm until Friday and the part

00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:42,670
and creates an JIRA ticket from it

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:46,930
because our illness reports are created

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:52,119
through Zahra tickets so would be quite

00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:55,449
easy so our entity here is it's Friday

00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:58,689
because this is see it's a kind of a

00:13:55,449 --> 00:14:05,800
match or it's it's it's a kind of the

00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:08,170
thing I can measure and this is what

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,749
Friday here is some kind of an end date

00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:13,569
if I if it makes this is a sentence

00:14:10,749 --> 00:14:16,269
today's the shadow as a bot have to

00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:20,529
recognize the stop base mostly system is

00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:23,529
today when I write the sentence and Eid

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:30,100
day so it's it's Friday so this this is

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:32,920
the entity and then as a base feature so

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:40,870
we have got the intent we have got the

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:43,470
entity and we have got some yeah here's

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,720
the sentence broccoli to into its pieces

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:48,610
again we we've got to intent somebody

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,179
wants to report its illness it's work

00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:56,319
and we have the entities coach and dates

00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:59,230
and so it's Friday and the thing machine

00:14:56,319 --> 00:15:02,980
learning or intelligence can can do here

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,529
for us is not to do it on on string

00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,259
matches we have had here before where we

00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:12,939
train only only this kind of sentence

00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:16,689
and see is a the model should recognize

00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:20,490
every other day also so I shouldn't have

00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:28,749
to train him or or some days then this

00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:32,009
so that is a string match again so the

00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:32,009
difference to NLP is

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:44,079
it is it's more it's it's more is a

00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:53,949
subset of energy use just a subset and

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:56,829
just that's easy the the record nation

00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:58,569
of the attempt and of the entities is

00:15:56,829 --> 00:16:04,120
natural language processing included

00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:08,610
more like you can make a dry dialogue

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:12,040
flows and something more so this your

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:15,930
use cases asset pot we try to implement

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:19,750
you at the moment interface for machines

00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:25,750
intent analysis what I meant was intent

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:30,490
analysis is when somebody maybe it does

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:32,259
a product review or this is give some

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:38,379
note about a product it would be quite

00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:41,620
cool to recognize which maybe it was a

00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,990
bad bad notice about the product it

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,470
would be quite cool to to recognize what

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:50,350
would be is the right one for him to to

00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:52,420
given some some recommendations what to

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:56,529
buy next time is this what would be a

00:16:52,420 --> 00:17:02,920
nice feature to do for for foreign

00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:07,539
magazine this is the intent doesn't

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:11,289
matter here data yeah it's just if it's

00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:15,819
the same here we can bound a band or our

00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:18,819
set pot into these II common interfaces

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:22,299
we can bind it to two integrations for

00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:26,470
an extra for theory for Google and to to

00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:30,429
let them do our work and the things I

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:32,049
try to note here but I've got a little

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:34,040
problem with data program see here

00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:38,810
because

00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:42,020
if if especially my example was with HR

00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:44,690
section this is really it's really

00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:48,350
tightly covered to to private data and I

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:53,450
wouldn't put this data into some Google

00:17:48,350 --> 00:18:00,290
API to to direct or just to give them

00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:12,700
the data so this is the reason why I

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:16,940
started doing it myself and here is the

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:21,410
four that I'm using rasa rasa it's a

00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:26,090
free Python tool which really runs

00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:29,390
really good with was with NAU so I've

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:33,830
got a complete framework to train

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:35,870
moderates to to pass moderates to even

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,530
have in kind of an online training to

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:43,220
make it interactive to make the training

00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:45,170
interactive it's it's just a docker

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:48,230
container at the moment for me or it's

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:52,850
it's some kind of code you can extract

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:55,130
or you can append to and it's free it

00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:59,300
sits on your on your own machine and

00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,970
instead I currently install it as as an

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,210
simply docker container you just need

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,670
the the performance to train your

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:13,250
moderates but for most use cases if you

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:15,320
have got in and close it or and a model

00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,210
that isn't that big it's it's good

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,130
enough you you haven't you shouldn't

00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:25,330
have to talk to to GUI or something else

00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:28,750
you could do it on your own I think we

00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:35,510
have some examples here this just easy

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:38,330
it's the nation and yeah it's written in

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:42,460
Python and Python isn't is the topic of

00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:44,390
such comprehensive so so I wrote an

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,050
implementation for PHP is this

00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,650
implementation is

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:52,710
yeah you had to see this Justin Justin

00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:55,430
object representation for the API I get

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:59,460
from from from these from from Raza

00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:03,420
because starting this this application

00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:10,400
gives me a Python server with an API and

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:13,950
that can talk with this API and so I

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,470
created it and as I said at the

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,870
beginning I'm normally a simply if I'm

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:21,300
in list and so I created some some

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,670
simply commands here and here you can

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,360
see what you can normally do when when

00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:31,530
it works and you can train more it's we

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:34,560
can have a look at our models later we

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:36,540
can get the status and you get some

00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,960
information about your models or many

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:41,880
trains ahead and you can remove models

00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,580
and the most important thing and this is

00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:50,160
a thing we we we want to use for Shepard

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:53,070
is as easy parts of the face that means

00:20:50,160 --> 00:21:02,940
just of to to pass a string and get its

00:20:53,070 --> 00:21:09,750
intense and so now I just wait for the

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:24,200
last layers of the image we have got big

00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:24,200
class of I use this we can have

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:37,330
and it is what inside of one my my one

00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,539
of my repositories in for the slides I

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,710
will edit through the slides later and

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:45,580
here we we have cut two years of

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:48,549
representation for for for for for the

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:51,400
API and this is just some moderates to

00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:55,330
the to do to get the data and just some

00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,880
services to yeah to encapsulate the ziza

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,760
communication at the end it's it's just

00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,950
a single a simple care request with with

00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:10,900
chuckles some Jason dater

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:16,020
and so and I hope I would get some

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:20,140
answers now because my container is up

00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:25,169
it works the container works I would

00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,169
look before I show to you

00:22:52,040 --> 00:23:02,250
we're done you can see some things I'm

00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,140
working at the moment but the major part

00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:09,540
isn't really working because I don't get

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,770
the the training data in and what you

00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,160
can see here is the same picture as

00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:16,200
before the end points what what is

00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:21,510
working this is status Edward to get oh

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:26,550
I've got a model inside ah now it gets

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:29,820
right where does it come from

00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:33,680
so just see I have had an error before

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:37,680
but the errors just output P afterwards

00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:39,720
as you can see here we have got we've

00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:42,530
got one model trains here this is this

00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:46,200
one and this is the model we we try to

00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:48,960
we try to ask a question and this is

00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:56,790
this question we try to implement them

00:23:48,960 --> 00:24:01,220
in our in our asset but just need to

00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:04,220
know what text set and project is set

00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,220
project

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:28,100
this and my text is yeah yeah the thing

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,660
that doesn't work at the moment because

00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:37,010
I destroyed it tonight and normally you

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:48,160
get some some kind of answer the only

00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:48,160
thing I can look now is to get a string

00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,070
[Music]

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:05,420
the only thing we can do at the moment

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:11,300
is to look at our training data to give

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:15,430
you just a feeling for for what you have

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:15,430
to do of what you have not

00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:35,890
in this report this is the thing you can

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:38,770
you put issues and different formats to

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:41,620
figure your mother or to train your

00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:45,429
model and the sentences are quite like

00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:49,179
like templates and those templates you

00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:52,059
say what what what is the entity what do

00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:54,790
you want how do you want to call it he

00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:58,990
is called last day and one of this

00:25:54,790 --> 00:26:02,760
example is Friday and it's the same for

00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:06,190
the first day and you can give him some

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:22,770
some some enumeration or some collection

00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:27,490
of possible of possible values and it's

00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:30,730
just just some kind of configuration and

00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:36,280
what also stood with rather is to do

00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:38,169
some dialogues because you can do real

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,240
conversations and you can make

00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:43,660
conversation path maybe beginning with

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,610
an beginning with a greeting begin with

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,240
with a question and having some

00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,700
decisions

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,530
how's the question answered and then

00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,330
ending it maybe we send a pie or

00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:58,059
something it and this one you can also

00:26:52,330 --> 00:27:02,020
configure inside those inside that kind

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:04,929
of configuration and what what is also

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:09,270
included is some kind of transformation

00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:13,450
for the data because this is the thing i

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:15,669
i i won't do on my own because when i

00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:18,870
see there are a lot of representations

00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:23,559
especially for time or for dates to to

00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:25,900
in a conversation so there there are

00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:32,290
some kind of of moderates or some kind

00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:33,740
of things I adhere I would it there is

00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:41,300
if you know

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:44,210
I have it here no yeah this uh some some

00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:47,920
some some little helpers which transform

00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:52,460
my entities to values I could work with

00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:54,410
to having Friday it's a real unicode

00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,860
date string at the end in my entity

00:27:54,410 --> 00:28:00,020
property it's quite useful because I

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:02,620
don't do it I don't have to do it on my

00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:12,020
own and this is the thing I get there

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:14,060
and yeah now it just just to show you

00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:26,390
about what doesn't work and what should

00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:29,330
work is with my console is good yeah at

00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:31,310
the end what what I try to do and what I

00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:35,260
will finish and I will choose the slides

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:37,640
tonight I think is not nothing I promise

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,950
it's just the example from for the

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,820
conversation at the end because what

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:46,850
what what I miss is calling this is this

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,240
API to pass the string and to answer it

00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:53,060
in my my but here it's the same

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,670
conversation we we have here I just want

00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,650
to make the conversation to my-my-my

00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:02,720
Raza running you see that the model is

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,340
there most of it is working but what one

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:12,620
of the questions doesn't work at the

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:14,690
moment so I will edit tonight it was

00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,570
night so we could see is easy example

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:20,720
it's working and we're pushing examples

00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:23,090
then also to get up repository so you

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,730
can try it on on your own the major

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:31,130
thing is writing a set pot this you

00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:32,630
could do it you could do it on your own

00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,180
and you should do it on your own you

00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,000
shouldn't work with with services like

00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:41,270
like googly when you have got data

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,880
issues or data privacy issues you could

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,700
write really really easy shut pots just

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:51,490
by some string comparisons or by some

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:54,830
access think most customer won't really

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:57,350
recognizes or if you've got a

00:29:54,830 --> 00:30:03,320
complicated questions you can run your

00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:06,620
own nau model if just inside a container

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:09,560
was in certain and tiny application and

00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:13,220
you can train it for the data you like

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:17,330
to have in there and this is quite

00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:19,460
easier if you've seen the Gator was it's

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:22,460
just a small model at the moment but but

00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,560
it really works to train it for such a

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:27,260
conversation for such an intent for such

00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:31,760
small things and for those small things

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:38,740
you you don't have to interact with data

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,740
eating services Cynthia done it so

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:59,680
yeah so I think I left you with more

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:02,350
questions than before this is really

00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:05,830
good but I will answer the questions

00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:09,160
afterwards in in kind of the promise

00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:12,670
code and the working example and are

00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:25,390
there other questions before that except

00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:28,030
my confusedness just one hide if you

00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:31,300
like to if you want to get up early

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:34,450
morning tomorrow morning just to see is

00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:37,090
this light you shouldn't you shouldn't

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,030
have to because most of them I explained

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:43,080
it at the moment just now because

00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:47,100
tomorrow I will only go into explaining

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:52,390
what NAU is and that conversation was

00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:54,250
was without a chatbot so just for you

00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:59,260
not to get upset early because I think

00:31:54,250 --> 00:32:04,630
the talk was moved to 8:30 or 9:30 which

00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:07,420
is almost the same if there are other

00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:10,210
questions you you will find the me here

00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:15,730
to conference we have information desk

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:18,640

00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:23,080
on Twitter and can write me an email and

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,570
I would do another talk tomorrow about

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,290
some climate problems or our

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:31,090
responsibility and in the climate crisis

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:34,090
this is one of the reasons why I'm that

00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:37,750
confused not really good prepared

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:40,380
because this is next to my job the main

00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:44,200
thing I'm currently doing and purely

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,510
working for for for the climate movement

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,250
for to support the Friday's for future

00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:52,660
