In 2018 the W3C released the candidate recommendation for the new Web Authentication Standard "WebAuthn". Already supported by all major browser vendors, it strives to make passwords as well as phishing a thing of the past. Given that haveibeenpwned.com‚Äôs database contains over 500 million stolen credentials, the switch away from passwords should happen sooner rather than later. Are you prepared to support the new means of authentication? Get ready for the future and learn what WebAuthn is about, how it works, and how to leverage its potential for your site today using PHP and JavaScript.
