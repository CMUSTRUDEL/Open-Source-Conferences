Developers need tools to be productive. In this session, Sebastian Bergmann presents an overview of the tools every PHP developer needs to know. For instance, we will have a look at dephpend, php-cs-fixer, phpstan, phan, and PHPUnit. Tools are not an end unto themselves, though. Therefore we will also discuss how these tools fit into your development process.
