Relational SQL has been abandoned in 1999. Since then, SQL has got many non-relational features for problems that are hard to solve with relational algebra. Today, SQL is turing complete, can process graphs, has semantic understanding of XML and JSON, is able to automatically keep historic versions, can analyze time series using regular expressions, and much more.This presentation demonstrates what modern SQL can do for you. It compares two different approaches to common problems: a purely relational one and the modern SQL approach. In this session, developers and software architects of all levels gain a better understanding of where SQL is today so that they are able to make more educated decisions. A lot has happened since SQL-92!
