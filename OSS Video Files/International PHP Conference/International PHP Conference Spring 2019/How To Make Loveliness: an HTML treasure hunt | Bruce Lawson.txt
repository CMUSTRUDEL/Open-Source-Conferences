You’re a PHP ninja. You’re a React god. You’re a magician with Sketch. But if your code is assembling HTML to get delivered to a users’ browser, how much do you know about HTML’s semantics? Choosing the correct HTML elements rather than vomiting a "div" or belching out a "span" can greatly enhance the end users’ experience, with no fragile extra code to write and maintain. 

One of the co-editors of the HTML5.3 spec will take you on a magical treasure hunt around HTML, showing you marvelous gifts and hidden wonders that will also help future-proof your code, and turn you into a time-travelling Frontend Superhero, adored by millions*.
(* Actual number not guaranteed. But your users will be happy.)
