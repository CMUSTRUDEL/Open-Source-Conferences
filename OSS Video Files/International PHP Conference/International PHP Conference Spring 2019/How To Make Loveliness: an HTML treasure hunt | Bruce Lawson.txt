Publication date: 2019-08-13
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Bruce Lawson (Web Developer) | https://phpconference.com/speaker/bruce-lawson/

You’re a PHP ninja. You’re a React god. You’re a magician with Sketch. But if your code is assembling HTML to get delivered to a users’ browser, how much do you know about HTML’s semantics? Choosing the correct HTML elements rather than vomiting a "div" or belching out a "span" can greatly enhance the end users’ experience, with no fragile extra code to write and maintain. 

One of the co-editors of the HTML5.3 spec will take you on a magical treasure hunt around HTML, showing you marvelous gifts and hidden wonders that will also help future-proof your code, and turn you into a time-travelling Frontend Superhero, adored by millions*.
(* Actual number not guaranteed. But your users will be happy.)

[Music]

00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:13,139
mine kleiner Liebling x' and now it's

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,020
English because I'm too stupid to learn

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:19,369
German and there's lots of you and I'm

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:24,320
nervous so I'm going going foot to naked

00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:29,150
yeah I'm Bruce Lawson and my talk is on

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:33,329
how to make loveliness which is what

00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:35,809
HTML stands for it's an acronym for how

00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:41,430
to make loveliness and this is an HTML

00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:45,570
treasure hunt Oh Who am I I am one of

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:50,250
the editors of the HTML specification in

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:54,410
the w3c which is the body that makes web

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,750
standards I was wrong of the committee

00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:01,350
having all the fun of making the British

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,359
standard for commissioning accessible

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,170
websites those are websites that people

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,570
with all kinds of disabilities can use

00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:13,590
and I co-wrote the first book on html5

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:19,950
and this book on web accessibility and

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:22,200
I'm really old but I I'll say it to you

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:27,330
because your friends my name's Bruce and

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm an HTML coholic this is this is a

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:34,229
brand of clothing in Japan actually

00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:37,579
weirdly so I had to lie down in the

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:41,610
department store and but I love HTML

00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:45,689
because HTML if you use it right it has

00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:47,700
all kinds of treasure and this isn't a

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,810
particularly technical talk there's

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,700
stuff here for designers developers and

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:56,430
your hardcore JavaScript developers

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,219
people like me who started on Fortran

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,159
and COBOL and ended up in PHP there's

00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:04,920
stuff here for SEO types and there's

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,429
stuff here for managers if you are a

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,899
manager any suits in the house just just

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,899
wave your banknotes

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,950
but talking of money hey HTML can give

00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,350
you a lot of rewards that you have to

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:27,960
know where to find them so the treasure

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:30,150
is if you use just simple HTML the

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,090
simple stuff and that's in the pointy

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,620
brackets your sites can be more

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,540
performant faster and we all know that

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,780
every second it takes your site to load

00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,940
you're losing business those people

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,390
don't give up and not buy whatever it is

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,940
they just buy it from your competitor

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:54,360
will make the web more accessible so you

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,510
are not locking out the 10 to 20 percent

00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,030
of people who have a disability it's not

00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,380
just people who are blind it's people

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,130
like me because I have multiple

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:08,310
sclerosis so sometimes I can't use my

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,070
hands very well you're making the web

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:14,670
more robust you're making your websites

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:18,240
more robust there's less to break you

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:21,950
are writing less code and writing less

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:24,570
code is kind of our job Mark Twain

00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:27,120
memorably said I was sorry that I wrote

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,360
such a long letter I didn't have time to

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,000
write a short one our job is to write

00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,250
less code and if we write less code we

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,490
do less testing and if we do less

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,100
testing we have more time in the pub or

00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:44,910
playing call of duty seeing your kids

00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:49,170
whatever is you like to do or for the

00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:51,270
manager is counting your money so let's

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:54,390
look at the treasure map and let's look

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,850
at how we can achieve this use HTML

00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:02,760
properly I'm gonna show you how right

00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:08,190
more HTML use CSS properly built in

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:10,980
beats bolt-on beegley this means if you

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:15,450
can use something that has stuff built

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:17,670
in automatically it's much better than

00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:21,000
you having to bolt it on because you

00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,820
will forget if things get lost in copy

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,690
and pasting somebody comes in after you

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,840
and removes it

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,290
they don't understand it I'm not scared

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,330
of frameworks I was in Bucharest and I

00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:35,550
saw this graffiti saying we had to run

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:40,530
but I'm not scared I was recently

00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:45,980
working on a CSS library for react with

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:50,900
Wix but these things react angular ember

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:54,510
PHP these are just tools ah

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:57,810
they are big well-known tools but

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,850
nevertheless they're just tools if you

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,660
want to use reactant Bank Euler bone

00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:04,980
strapped hub pack is for your project

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,010
great knock yourself out

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,680
just make sure that the code this

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,910
produces the HTML that goes to the

00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,700
visitors browser is good I like

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,970
furniture we have some furniture in

00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,710
England you will be surprised to learn

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:27,270
soon after Briggs it will be burning it

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:30,690
to keep ourselves warm but and this is

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:33,660
the this is the most this is the Bible

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,960
of furniture making since its first

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,270
publication in 1970 the technique of

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,330
furniture making is the Bible for all

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:45,990
woodworkers and the introduction they

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:49,110
say even in this age of machine yet a

00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,820
machine made furniture the textbook must

00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,970
deal primarily with the basic

00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,740
handicrafts if all the machine can ever

00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:00,960
do was translate the essential hand

00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,300
operations of rotary movements if you

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,270
are operating a machine that makes

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,610
furniture if you have had to saw that

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,040
piece of wood by hand you will have

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:12,960
likely know much more about at yellow

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,840
greater respect for it and will

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,180
understand it in greater depth and this

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,910
is why the techniques of furniture

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:23,100
making the first hundred pages is not

00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,350
about furniture at all it's about the

00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,840
moisture content of different wood it's

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,860
about which cut of the wood has

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,930
different strength and tensile

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,880
robustness it's about the grain it's

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,060
about knowing the

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,520
materials and because I like furniture

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:46,200
and I like noodles I got interested in

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:49,350
Japanese woodworking it's an interesting

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:52,700
bit in this book by mr. Tasha add arte

00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:55,410
the Japanese word Shakuni is defined as

00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,450
craftsman or autism but such a literal

00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,420
description does not fully Express the

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:04,580
deeper meaning

00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:08,810
oops oh go back you fool

00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,320
okay whatever alright that is bad sorry

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,600
knowing your tools

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,550
Shakuni means not only having technical

00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,090
skill but implies an attitude and a

00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,310
social consciousness a social obligation

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:23,600
to do your best for the general welfare

00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,910
of the people an obligation both

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:30,330
spiritual and material and I think we

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:33,420
need to be sure kunnen of the web you've

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:36,510
heard of this guy this is Sir uncle

00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,820
Timbo as I call him but you can call him

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:41,460
Tim berners-lee and he invented the web

00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,190
and he memorably said this is for

00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,280
everyone at the opening of the London

00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,690
2012 Olympics and it was this is the

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,540
first-ever web page the first of a web

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:58,860
page that sir uncle Timbo made and this

00:07:54,540 --> 00:08:02,750
is it running in chrome a month ago and

00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:07,230
you will notice that it is completely

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:10,500
responsive out-of-the-box it just works

00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:12,390
I can tab with the keyboard because my

00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:15,360
MS means I can't use the mouse very well

00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:18,540
and I can go link by link and I see

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,880
where I am on the page and if I click

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,110
the link it goes somewhere the

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:28,800
first-ever web page 25 or 30 years ago

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:33,240
fully accessible fully responsive and we

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:36,870
broke it we broke the web we developers

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,419
and designers by choice or by ignorants

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,910
broke it and we broke it because we

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,710
insisted upon fixed width in the old

00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:45,450
days when everybody had a big monitor we

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,760
said everybody will have a big wide

00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,070
screens

00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,090
we had fixed with websites we have bad

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:55,820
contrast bad fonts bad colors pic we

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,790
insisted upon pixel perfect layout like

00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,270
it was print we didn't have captions for

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,670
videos or we deliberately broke the

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,700
ability to use the keyboard to navigate

00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,740
a webpage and we removed the focus

00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:13,220
indicator if you are evil

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,500
you can just say star focus outline on

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:17,180
and you can make it so anybody tabbing

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,630
through the page has no idea where they

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,580
are

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:21,110
so you've broken that webpage for me

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,170
because I don't use a mouse

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,360
thank you we need to get back to not

00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:29,780
being obsessed by the tools we need to

00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,490
get back to being understanding the raw

00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:35,840
materials and the raw materials of the

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,450
web a JavaScript html5 and css3 as

00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:41,090
symbolized by these handsome men this is

00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,300
Brendan Eich who invented JavaScript

00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:46,790
this is me I didn't invent HTML but I

00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,960
did invent the picture element and this

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:54,440
is how can we only who invented CSS they

00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:59,480
have JavaScript HTML and CSS happily

00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:03,860
having a beer together not fighting well

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:06,860
not until the fifth pint but I'm English

00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:10,870
after all and so it's possible for all

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,460
these things to coexist in harmony but

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:17,390
some people don't understand this this

00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:19,490
is was a medium a few months ago I've

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,840
taken the name of the author away

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,910
because I don't want to name and shame

00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:26,870
it's not about the wrong person who

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:29,240
wrote this it's about general malaise in

00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,880
our industry 10 things to learn for

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,400
becoming a solid full stack JavaScript

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,440
developer the top 4 he said how a

00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:39,320
fundamental understanding of JavaScript

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:40,910
ok yeah of course you can't do a full

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,980
stack JavaScript development to a full

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:47,150
stack any web development without

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:49,370
learning JavaScript itself yeah ok then

00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,820
a front-end framework this isn't the

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,100
second essential knowledge angular or

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,810
react you don't need that to make web

00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,580
development

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:01,560
bootstrap for and then kind of as an

00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:05,160
afterthought oh you need to know HTML

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,839
CSS he said as for HTML is not much to

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,870
learn right away and you can kind of

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,610
learn as you go just know the difference

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,320
between span and div and this will save

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,800
you a huge amount of headache when

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,930
fiddling with your CSS code and this is

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:24,269
part of the problem seeing the two

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,519
foundational technologies of the Weber's

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:27,390
kind of an afterthought you can learn as

00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,230
you go along

00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:33,600
it's fiddling about so we're gonna go

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,160
back to go back to my carpentry metaphor

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,100
we're going to learn about those raw

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,339
materials we're gonna look at the wood

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,980
HTML is declarative I say give me a

00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:46,709
button and the browser gives me a button

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,709
I don't need to know how the browser

00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:53,670
makes it focusable I don't need to know

00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:57,450
how the browser is listening for a press

00:11:53,670 --> 00:12:02,130
or a click or somebody hitting Enter

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:05,399
I just declare it to be so entities hTML

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:08,820
is fault tolerance the blink tag which

00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:12,480
you should never use was never

00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,430
implemented by Internet Explorer but

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,790
because HTML is fault tolerant when

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:20,520
Internet Explorer saw this okay it

00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:24,630
didn't blink but it would always show

00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:26,940
the content it didn't crash out and show

00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:28,560
an error in the console it just showed

00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,300
the content of a tagger didn't

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,149
understand and continued and this is a

00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:36,079
hugely powerful because it meant that

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:39,600
when we invented the video element

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,850
because HTML fault-tolerant browsers

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,339
that understand the video ignored the

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,310
stuff inside the tags browsers that had

00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:49,170
no idea what the video element did would

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:51,060
show the stuff in the tag in in this

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,040
case give me a link to download the

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,529
video and use the operating systems

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,209
built-in player this meant that when you

00:12:55,529 --> 00:13:00,750
started using the video elements from

00:12:57,209 --> 00:13:02,820
html5 if you did this

00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,730
it worked for everybody everybody would

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,320
have access to the video at least so

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,889
when I invented the picture element

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,709
or using for Responsive images this is

00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:17,769
what we did if you are a browser that

00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:21,370
understands the web P format which is 30

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:25,240
or 40 percent smaller than JPEG for the

00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:28,870
same quality if you understand the web P

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,670
format show the web P if you don't

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:33,459
understand the web P or you don't

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:36,069
understand the picture element just go

00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:39,069
back to the content in the middle show

00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:41,680
me a JPEG and everybody gets the images

00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:44,949
nobody gets a worse experience this is

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,860
super powerful I showed you the first

00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:51,509
ever web page running in a modern

00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:55,089
browser this is the first ever browser

00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:59,440
that Tim berners-lee wrote and showing

00:13:55,089 --> 00:14:03,130
my wordpress blog okay it's not it's not

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:07,000
the nicest experience there we go Bruce

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,740
Lawson Cote UK okay it doesn't

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,550
necessarily show me any pretty

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:15,279
attractive CSS but all the content is

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,959
there this is because HTML so

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,930
fault-tolerance that the first-ever

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:25,029
browser that only understands HTML one

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:28,029
can still show my html5 content HTML is

00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:30,370
interoperable if I open ABI I open that

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:33,190
I and I don't close them in the right

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,730
order it still works

00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:39,160
before HTML 5 every browser would make a

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,990
different Dom that's the document object

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,300
model that the browser actually works

00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,610
with and that meant that Java scripts

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,649
were highly highly fragile because every

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,279
browser would make a different Dom no

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:53,380
browser was wrong because HTML 4 only

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,110
told you what to do with good markup I

00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,600
know looking at you that everybody in

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,180
this room never makes an error in their

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,130
code right but we all have that loser in

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:09,399
the office who does sometimes

00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:12,490
yeah but HTML 5 defines exactly and

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,889
totally how to make the same Dom across

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,270
browsers with any combination of bad

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:21,760
markup it's like an HTML ninja it's high

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:24,280
are powerful and nobody ever notices it

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,580
but that's why the the web is more

00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:30,130
interoperable than ever before

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:33,250
javascript is not declarative javascript

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:37,000
is imperative you have to tell it how to

00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:41,140
do things and if it doesn't understand

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,420
it will break therefore it's not fault

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,520
tolerant and if the central

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:49,620
functionality of your website requires

00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:52,150
JavaScript it will break for some people

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:54,820
Tim berners-lee said when he invented

00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:58,120
the internet use the principle of least

00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:01,600
power the low power end of the scale is

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:06,160
tips typically simpler to design

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:09,460
implement and use if you use the lowest

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,010
power tool to do the job it's easier for

00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:15,400
you to code it's easier for tests and

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:19,120
it's less likely to break under strange

00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:20,800
conditions maybe somebody is not getting

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,020
JavaScript because of behind a weird

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,560
fire or maybe somebody's looking at your

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:30,070
content on an old Nokia phone running

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,510
Opera Mini in Bangladesh there's all

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:33,850
kind of conditions which you can't

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:38,920
predict use the principle of least power

00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,960
use the right tool for the job 13

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:45,130
million requests for JavaScript for time

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:47,530
out said BuzzFeed 1% of all requests for

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,950
JavaScript on BuzzFeed time out that's

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,620
13 million requests a month this is not

00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,660
a problem that's happening in the

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,970
emerging economies BuzzFeed is read by

00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:01,000
people in Berlin and Birmingham where

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:03,310
I'm from it's because you're in the

00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,990
underground on the metro and the

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,690
JavaScript doesn't load or you using

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,660
public Wi-Fi on a train every one of us

00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:12,610
has experience no JavaScript my friend

00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:16,810
Stuart language made this everybody has

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:20,380
JavaScript right no each one of us has

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:22,330
experience no JavaScript some time those

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,550
taking photographs I'm going to put this

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:29,220
slides on the web later today so you can

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,220
grab all the stats and and stuff

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,570
HTML gives you these freebies this is a

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,650
joke

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:42,770
Thank You freebies here's a demo we've

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:44,870
all seen this check if you don't want to

00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:48,740
not opt out of canceling a stopping

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,580
sending you spam forever these two look

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,160
identical

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:57,110
well actually apart from the spacing

00:17:52,160 --> 00:18:00,380
here the top one I can only check it if

00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:02,480
I actually can focus into that little

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,460
box look here I am trying to click

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:10,940
around and I can't check into it I have

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:14,120
to be accurate there the second one I

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,710
can click anywhere in the label and fill

00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,660
it and it will check this is really

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:20,210
useful if like me you don't have good

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,850
motor control it's really useful if you

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,460
are on a bumpy train with a small screen

00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:28,880
and you've got podgy little dev fingers

00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:32,330
trying to hit that little checkbox how

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,730
do we do this we use proper HTML the

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:37,460
first one has an input type equals

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,710
checkbox and then the check if you don't

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,950
want to not opt out is in the span and a

00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:45,290
span has no meaning it does nothing the

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,799
second one have simply put a label

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:53,080
around the input and I've got my stuff

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:57,080
and browsers for free all browsers since

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:59,660
1995 if you click in the label it will

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,590
automatically check the check box so you

00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,690
saw free for you using built-in browser

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,299
behavior just makes people's lives

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:12,770
better and it doesn't make your life

00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:14,210
worse because the way people who are

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:17,179
blind or people use assistive

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:21,049
technologies work excuse me is they

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:24,140
might use a screen reader your app in

00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:25,700
the browser the browser makes a document

00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,390
object model but it also makes an

00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,100
accessibility tree it translates our

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:33,140
things in the browser into things the

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:35,299
operating system knows about because

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,870
every operating system has checkboxes

00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,480
radio buttons

00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,030
and then the screen reader talks to the

00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:48,270
accessibility tree and that talks to the

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:50,850
user if you use the label oh you're not

00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:52,500
waving at me for time good sorry Petra's

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:55,190
like the boss and they kick me and

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:59,160
reduce my fee for every second I go over

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:01,440
if you use the accessibility tree then

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:05,100
you're giving information to a blind or

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,990
disabled user if you use it and the user

00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,200
isn't blind or disabled it doesn't

00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:15,120
matter isn't her on anybody so your

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:18,630
button if you just use a div as a lot of

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,020
people do and say click me okay great

00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,780
but you are also responsible for setting

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,120
the Aria role in our HTML or JavaScript

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,640
you're also responsible for making sure

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,190
that you can focus with the keyboard

00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:34,260
because divs are not focusable with a

00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,510
keyboard by default and you're also

00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:39,720
responsible for listening for a key

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:43,920
press which is a spacebar or enter and a

00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,470
touch you have to do this if you don't

00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,210
want to use a button element if you use

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:50,910
a button element you get all of this for

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:54,780
free lester code less to test less to

00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:58,590
break in the old days we had this dave

00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:01,410
idea was header main article diva dick

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:02,190
was an avid divide across footer this

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:05,670
was great

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,220
but deve has no meaning at all in the

00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,290
specification the development has no

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,150
special meaning at all authors are

00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:14,340
strongly encouraged to view the

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:17,150
development as an element of last resort

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:20,490
for when no other element is appropriate

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:24,120
and for the last 10 years or so we've

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:26,250
had the header element the main element

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,809
for your main content the nav element

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:33,750
and the footer element every assistive

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:36,780
technology has a button that allows

00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,640
somebody to press one keystroke and they

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:41,550
will jump straight to the navigation or

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,370
one keystroke and they jump straight to

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,710
the main content every assistive

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:49,090
technology has this and frankly if

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:54,700
you're writing div

00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:58,659
why not right nav and get all of this

00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:01,480
behavior for free with no harm to

00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:03,070
yourself so when you go to the pub you

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,080
go to the pub a bit earlier because

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,840
you're writing less JavaScript and you

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,570
can buy yourself one extra beer to

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:16,899
reward yourself for your service to

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:21,610
humanity screenreader users were asked

00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:24,730
last year if there are nav main header

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:29,289
footer how often do you use them 25%

00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:33,759
whenever they're present 18% often 28%

00:22:29,289 --> 00:22:37,869
sometimes only 13% said never so if you

00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:42,789
use these things you are helping I don't

00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:45,639
know 70% of people at no cost to you and

00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:48,869
no impact for people who don't need

00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:52,090
these say these things it's just free I

00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:55,299
don't have time to show this but yeah I

00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:58,769
do okay I asked my friend Leone Watson

00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:02,440
who is another editor of the html5 spec

00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:07,330
but she is a designer who went blind in

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:09,549
her twenties and now she works educating

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,009
people about accessibility and helping

00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:14,470
edit the HTML spec and I asked her to

00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:16,809
look at some sites and show us how she

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,480
used them with a screen reader and I

00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:21,399
volunteered mine not because I'm a great

00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,320
God and I know everything but because I

00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:25,899
don't believe in naming and shaming so

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:29,139
you know Alfred mine and this is what

00:23:25,899 --> 00:23:31,029
she found and I tried to put captions on

00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:33,100
this but something happened with the

00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:35,279
internet last night but I caption it

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,279
online

00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:35,490
etc this is vitally important for

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:39,210
somebody who's an advanced web user and

00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,970
no cost to you there's anybody here does

00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:46,650
their boss ever say please make the site

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:47,340
less friendly to Google not clever

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,920
bosses

00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,510
there's also structured data Google are

00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,610
we've known for a long time with you add

00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:56,100
markup to your content you help search

00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:58,650
engines understand different components

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,480
of a page and people like me been saying

00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:03,210
and this enhances user experience that

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,679
gets you more traffic yeah okay but last

00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:09,270
month Google published some numbers

00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:11,580
Eventbrite saw 100 percent increase in

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:15,600
euro year-on-year growth traffic from

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:18,360
the search job rapido soar 115 percent

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,270
increase in organic traffic 270 percent

00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:23,309
increase in new user registrations you

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,160
can read this is from Google doing case

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:30,150
studies implementing structured data in

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:33,840
people's sites if you use the HTML you

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:37,170
getting this for free and your boss will

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,080
kiss you and make a 20 meter statue of

00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:42,120
you in the car park and like just sticks

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:48,240
every morning in your honor

00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:53,270
guaranteed so how do I do this easy I

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:57,870
use html5 each of my articles in my

00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:59,820
single dot PHP all I do in WordPress is

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:03,960
I'd have an article element because it's

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:05,560
an article I give it some HTML microdata

00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,640
which comes from

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,550
deema dot org schema is run by Google

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,440
Bing Yandex which is the biggest Russian

00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:17,770
search engine and Baidu which is the

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,380
biggest Chinese search engine there is a

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:23,530
schema for almost everything medical

00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:26,590
research recipes football results I'm

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:29,560
using blog posting and all I'm doing is

00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:32,770
giving an extra hint about this is a

00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,810
headline it's the date this this date is

00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:38,710
the day created it's the pub date and

00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:41,800
it's the date and published this gets me

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:47,320
all of those great numbers you saw for

00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:51,220
free I know so it gets me a much better

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:55,270
user experience on an i watch i watch

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:57,190
Apple watch I do own last year at the

00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,550
Apple fest they said that the new

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:02,830
version of watch OS they will show web

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:07,480
content but because the screen is so

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:10,030
tiny they use the HTML elements to work

00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:11,920
out how to display things so if you use

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:17,070
an article element you get a nice

00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:20,650
display if you use itemprop html5

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,960
subheading pub date and author the watch

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:25,510
knows how to display it if you use the

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,670
figure elements the figcaption the watch

00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:31,270
knows how to display it if you use input

00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:33,400
type across tell data select the watch

00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:36,040
gives a nice user experience for the

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:40,020
punter now I know what you're thinking

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:42,760
okay Bruce you are a fashion icon

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,340
what's Bruce wearing today dr. bloure

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:47,950
calm is my fashion blog you're welcome

00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,490
to you know make yourself look better

00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:53,470
but ok I'm the first to admit that I'm

00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,500
not glamorous and I'm not beautiful so

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,960
if I'm not glamorous I'm not beautiful

00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,440
how am I even alo allowed to own an

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,530
Apple watch let alone be told by Apple

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,970
earlier what they were going to do well

00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:11,500
I didn't I I implemented that micro data

00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:14,200
seven years ago when I was experimenting

00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:15,820
with HTML I had no idea

00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,840
Apple were gonna come up with a watch

00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:22,350
but because I use the right markup I

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:25,320
future-proofed my site for a device I

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,230
had no idea no conception would ever

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,540
exist and making your website accessible

00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,180
to people with disabilities is an

00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,840
enhancement for people who do not have

00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:40,170
disabilities these pre people whose

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:45,390
names I cannot pronounce Smith Smith and

00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:49,170
Smith at the University of Switzerland

00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:51,930
it's around here somewhere they did some

00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:54,180
research with people who had no

00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:56,400
disabilities and they asked them to use

00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:59,030
a very accessible site a moderate

00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,220
accessible site and an inaccessible site

00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:04,470
61 participants without disabilities use

00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,160
three different levels of accessibility

00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:11,610
a high level of web accessibility led to

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:14,430
better performance than low level

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:16,380
accessibility high web accessibility

00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:19,860
improved user ratings perceived

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,530
usability aesthetics workload etc for

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,500
all participants even those who were

00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:28,770
disabled and not disabled so this is

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:31,680
evidence that making websites that work

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,780
for people with disabilities makes it

00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:37,710
better for everyone

00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,210
yes the University of Switzerland it's

00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:43,070
kind of next door I think or something

00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:47,970
anyway as my friend Jamie Knight who's a

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:51,300
an autistic guy who works at the BBC he

00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:54,740
says no one comes to our sites disabled

00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:57,480
they come with impairments and we

00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,200
disabled them or we can choose to

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:03,960
disable them or we can choose not

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:07,560
remember where the fluffy bunny of good

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:11,720
HTML goes the Tweety Bird of

00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:16,400
accessibility goes along for the ride

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,580
these were delicious by the way I'm safe

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:21,330
sir

00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:23,280
uncle Timbo said the web is for everyone

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:25,350
and collectively we hold the power to

00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:27,810
change it it won't be easy but if we

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,630
dream a little and work a lot we can get

00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:31,950
the web we want what can you do I know

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,340
what you're asking you're gonna come

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,680
I mean say Bruce what can I do you can

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,010
learn the semantics of HTML there are a

00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:42,690
hundred and twenty elements that's all

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:47,850
and most of them you will never use

00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:51,720
because they're weird I used to be a

00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:55,320
kindergarten teacher in Thailand most

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:58,740
two year olds can say 100 words in their

00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,970
native language by the time your toddler

00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,030
is two and a half

00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:07,140
she'll know close to 300 that's twice

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:13,230
the size of the vocabulary of HTML be

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:15,410
better than this this was delicious by

00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:15,410
the way

00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:22,680
so learn the semantics of HTML run

00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,580
automated tests that go for the low

00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,550
hanging fruit

00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:29,760
eg color contrast an organization called

00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:33,480
web aim looked at the top million home

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,150
pages on the you know the list of top

00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:40,500
websites they looked at the top million

00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:43,530
home pages 98% had an accessibility

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:50,330
problem but the most common one was

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:56,670
simply bad contrast low contrast

00:32:50,330 --> 00:33:00,300
designers I know that very thin fonts in

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:01,980
light gray on a white background are

00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,730
 beautiful

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:10,260
but I'm a hundred years old I can't read

00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:15,270
them so what I do is I downloaded this

00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:17,550
free thing from ADA ADA Canon and it

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:20,520
goes through my site and it highlights

00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:25,020
where there's bad contrast and then I

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:27,840
fixed it took me five minutes you can

00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,370
use HTML and CSS wherever possible you

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,560
can make sites that work without

00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,960
JavaScript then enhance them with

00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,600
JavaScript choose your libraries

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:40,050
carefully if you're using react

00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,180
components 10 on UI is Bruce approved it

00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:46,550
is perfectly accessible just take it and

00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,550
go it's BSD BDSM whatever

00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:52,060
whereas react bootstrap a very popular

00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,150
library they have a navigation thing but

00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:59,920
it's just a DF why known as Bruce

00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:02,920
rejected it just use less JavaScript we

00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,850
cannot continue to bloat the web with

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,060
JavaScript

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:11,860
the median mobile site at the end of

00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:14,500
last year sends 385 K of JavaScript and

00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:17,020
we cannot do this because it makes our

00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,870
lives easier because we are taxing the

00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,590
poorest users in Germany you work for

00:34:19,870 --> 00:34:25,840
one hour to afford 500 megabytes of

00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,960
mobile data in the u.s. you work for six

00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:31,120
hours in Brazil you work for 35 hours to

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,310
afford that so if your vomiting

00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,290
downloads of JavaScript to make your

00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:38,230
life better you're making somebody in

00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:43,480
Brazil work harder and that my friends

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:45,460
is naughty in Nigeria the data required

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,890
to what just two minutes of online video

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:51,130
a day is more expensive than sending

00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:53,950
your child to school I know your hero

00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,720
image and your hero video of your boss

looking over your office full of

00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,490
ping-pong tables is marvelous but it's

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,280
not more marvelous than sending a kid to

00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:06,640
school your react app will never load

00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,770
faster than one second on a phone in

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,320
India your angular app will always take

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:13,240
2.7 seconds to boot up because you're

00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:16,480
vomiting loads of JavaScript across the

00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:20,770
network and then the phone is having to

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,360
decode it pars it execute it there are 1

00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:25,600

people within mobile coverage there are

00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:35,260
4 billion people who could be on the web

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:39,400
who are not yet on the web and they are

00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:43,570

these 10 countries and only one of them

00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,190
is what we call developed

00:35:53,059 --> 00:36:00,299

making the Internet affordable is a

00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,690
global priority because there are people

00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:30,809

00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,000
