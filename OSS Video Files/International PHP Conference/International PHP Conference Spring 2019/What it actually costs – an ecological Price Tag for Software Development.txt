Title: What it actually costs – an ecological Price Tag for Software Development
Publication date: 2019-11-26
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2019
Description: 
	As I write these lines here, my fan is running at full speed. Not because I am so badly equipped, no, it’s because of the abundance of things that run alongside. For several open source projects, some docker containers are running; for a private project, a Kubernetes runs and purrs and provides scalability on the machine. And then there’s the virtual machine for the customer project; somehow, this machine never really stops, just like the whole computer.

In addition, tests and builds are running in different CI platforms. Those tests and builds that start with a simple git push origin my_branch. A job for every aspect of my application or library. Of course, as a developer, I’m happy when those jobs turn green. And in case it happens that I forgot a few lines of code to commit: git add . && git push orgin my_branch. It’s so easy. The CI will fix it; it costs me nothing.

Does it really cost nothing? Of course, depending on the type of CI platform, there will be hosting fees or other contributions. But these costs are only marginally noticeable in a large project. One price that I can’t recognize so far is the price for energy consumption. The energy consumption and the production of the machines that support us are always accompanied by an ecological price. Can we create a kind of label for this price, a counter which helps us prioritize features not only according to development times and benefits?

[Music]

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:14,130
hello everybody and hello I would like

00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,640
to welcome you to my talk and also I

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,779
would like to welcome you to a kind of a

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,550
retrospective for our earth because we I

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,460
think we have a problem but we will see

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,619
you later

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:32,640
just from four years it's me my name is

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:36,180
Maximilian the internet knows me as

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,329
electric max on almost all channels and

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,379
you can also write me an email and so on

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,140
I'm working for a company called

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,480
Mayflower we have three bases in Germany

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,829
we do software development and

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,379
consulting and was a fancy stuff and if

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,960
you'd like to get more information you

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,649
can protect me here on the on the floor

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,420
somewhere I it as a normal retrospective

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,059
where I would like to give you a kind of

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,510
an agenda we we can't do it as a

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:09,720
retrospective here but I would like to

00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:12,060
keep Z is he these normal parts for a

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,930
father agenda with hopefully some

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:21,600
outcome at the end and fall together

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:26,970
data I'm I'm looking on our us from a

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,610
perspective from 2100 and if we do

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,240
nothing and currently we are doing

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,229
nothing we we get an in temperature

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,470
increase menteur four to five degrees

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:46,920
and this will cause a lot of problems

00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:50,729
like like floods like like refugees and

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,880
the refugee is not only moving away from

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,070
from from the living spaces because I

00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,340
can't lives there anymore they will move

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:03,290
from there because of was about

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,570
resources it was about water or

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:11,840
or food and we have had I think that

00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,520
where 1.5 million refugees in the Year

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,170
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:24,350
you can you can multiplies by 100 or

00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:28,610
more just to get a comparison how big

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:34,040
this problem is because we we we are in

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:38,270
a wealthy place here in Europe but in

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,550
Africa for instance or India then we get

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:45,050
the most problems and there still have

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:47,480
problems and for France for the data we

00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:53,470
trust the scientists and the scientists

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:56,330
are organized in a panel called IPCC and

00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:59,270
it's called Intergovernmental Panel on

00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:02,680
Climate Change and there are these de

00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:05,450
scientists give us the information since

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,090
1990 and today is a give us a report

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:12,890
every year seven years so the last

00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:15,530
report is from 2014 and we get we also

00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:17,780
get some reports on between because I

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:22,300
have to correct senator mostly they have

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:28,190
to correct it into a direction which

00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:32,630
which draws our future more worse then

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:37,760
then we thought before just some

00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:43,940
examples in an overview we would get

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:47,870
more heating periods over time we have

00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:54,290
seen it in last year's well 2018 was the

00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:57,830
fourth we forced the first hottest year

00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,750
in in the complete history and you could

00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:03,380
say maybe oh it's just--see for swear

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:10,040
weapons the other three on the top and

00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:14,000
this way at 2017 2016 in 2015 so we we

00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,190
really feel that we are really inside to

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,190
change and

00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:22,010
we have to stop it at some point to not

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:27,340
get higher temperatures and higher up

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:31,460
bigger problems because those those

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:35,390
heating periods if they get more we've

00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:38,960
got a lot of more problems like our

00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:43,420
wheat production we have a lot of we we

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,770
have to change it and the a lot of

00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,690
populations or a lot of areas in the

00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:53,540
world won't have any chance to produce

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,870
their food and especially when we see

00:04:53,540 --> 00:05:03,320
the situation in India and yes as a as a

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:06,980
has got a really rising popularity and

00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:10,790
not probably so they're they're modest

00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:13,790
is growing so much and on the other side

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:18,170
they will have less food in the next in

00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:21,470
the upcoming years and there was easy

00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:26,000
problems come from when when we see is a

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:28,430
picture about refugees somebody here

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,390
from Netherlands or some coastal people

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,410
here you know that you get problems and

00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,920
upcoming years with more storm floods

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:41,630
maybe you're kept in a town with if you

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,770
would have a lot of water in your room

00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:49,430
in your house because we we will lose a

00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:53,320
lot of coastal areas because of the

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,570
rising of sea is the oceans but this I

00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:59,480
think is the data I show you here or I

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,000
mentioned in the text you you know it

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:04,990
it's it's just the data which is around

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,080
us I would like to come to the data

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:13,570
which belongs to our industry and so

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:18,500
this is my my intro for for the for the

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:22,340
generation of three insights and Z is

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,870
the main the main main issue we have at

00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:27,490
the moment our Z is the greenhouse gases

00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,190
it's it's quite typically to have some

00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,050
in our in our air we have some all the

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,790
times but we've got a problem

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:39,340
we increased their their amount and this

00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:43,990
is just a shot for for carbon dioxyde

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:47,949
for the for the last 20 years where we

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:51,520
increased it by a factor of from yeah

00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:54,520
we're increase it so much and when and

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,669
we and we still knows that we shouldn't

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,889
do but what we're still in the period

00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:03,100
where we increased it I talked to a

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:07,810
scientist yesterday and they he pointed

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:11,050
me on 2015 and this was quite decided

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:16,110
thought in 2015 yeah we got it we have

00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,110
got some pointer to move the curve and

00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:25,870
but you see it in 2016 and the following

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:29,650
yes was a little bit too early to be

00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,979
that happy and what I think we learn in

00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:36,389
school what what happens in by is our

00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:40,150
screen gas greenhouse gases is we have

00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:44,169
the temperature which increase over the

00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:48,550
last century and which gets higher over

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:50,889
the last years which yeah but this is

00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,370
quite a normal behavior we learn at

00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,500
school

00:07:51,370 --> 00:08:00,910
and but we we do nothing at the moment

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:03,340
so the next shot is just just to give

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:05,590
you an overview what what is our screen

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,419
house gases are is this carbon dioxyde

00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:13,870
this it's the main part it's also leaf

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:19,090
Matan in which which is produced by some

00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:23,370
cows that we will eat at a BBQ but they

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:27,160
will consume or produce some gas and

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,919
neat rocks eat is the thing we we've got

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,680
the problem with our diesel cars and in

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,020
the cities but the main issue is the

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,570
carbon dioxide and this carbon dioxide

00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,029
is produced by burning fossil fuels is

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:42,789
something we

00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:45,130
but what but what is the problem with

00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,529
submersible Zara atmosphere what do we

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:51,520
have a responsibility there by my

00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:54,460
machine here doesn't have any output and

00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,149
here mission out there i I see no coal

00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:02,050
burning what what what is our part and

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:06,060
our part and this is this game or in

00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:11,470
this M the situation is the electricity

00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:18,600
electricity and here you can see a card

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:23,649
for electricity production and a legend

00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:27,130
how many carbon dioxide emissions are

00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:30,959
included when producing electricity so

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:37,810
example an example would be in Germany

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:40,450
when we produce our electricity we we do

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:47,770
it by emitting 200

00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:51,310
what number is Elizabeth 279 gram carbon

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:53,620
dioxyde per kilowatt aura so every

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,940
kilowatt era you take from from from

00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:01,240
your from your energy provider is

00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:04,390
polluted for my from my point of view by

00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:12,480
carbon dioxyde and so all our machines

00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:14,800
are consuming those energy and but -

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,970
when you look at those numbers and you

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:24,010
try to compare and you you are too fast

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:27,640
you can run in a trap because this is

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:31,120
our or this is German amount of

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,930
electricity energy so electricity

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:40,200
produced by by here since it was in the

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:43,750
year and last year notices or just a a

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:47,560
forecast in 2017 we produced

00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:51,680
what are we used about 500

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:55,459
terawatt-hours for electricity

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,879
and here here's a good point to throw

00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:02,149
another number inside our our industry

00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:07,339
so the telecommunication and internet

00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:10,449
and so on consumes about sixty

00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:17,389
terawatt-hours a year so the last year

00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:21,350
would be to 2017 we consumed 62% were

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:24,649
set graph would mean oh the nearly 10%

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:30,819
of the of the energy we are producing

00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:33,499
and these are numbers some newspapers

00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:35,720
are printing and are telling the people

00:11:33,499 --> 00:11:38,360
but it's not not the correct number I

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,149
will show you one sled later but what's

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:45,259
the correct number is I just want to

00:11:41,149 --> 00:11:49,819
give you an overview for energy

00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:54,610
production what what the parts are or

00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:57,170
what what of which which parts are

00:11:54,610 --> 00:12:03,379
inside our energy production and you can

00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:07,189
see it's nearly 45 percent of our energy

00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:12,139
is produced by burning several several

00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:19,550
faucets and it's only about 25 percent

00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:22,550
is not on renewables so here's a chart

00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:25,449
which which is which comes to you to

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:28,480
write numbers this is the overall power

00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:31,819
consumption in Germany is it's about

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,179
2,500 terawatt-hours a year or four for

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:38,449
the last years and this is quite five

00:12:35,179 --> 00:12:41,209
times of the energy production energy

00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:45,559
consumption and compared to compared to

00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:48,470
this number our part in the in the

00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:51,170
energy consumption is just about two

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:57,290
person so it's it's just a smaller

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:59,689
number it's it's not that big but we has

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:03,429
a smaller number still stands an

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:05,470
emission of nearly 30 million tons of

00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:09,010
carbon dioxyde

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,200
and this is quite a big number again and

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:15,310
it's it's a responsibility because we

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,890
have to have to go down and to 0 to stop

00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:21,850
to only stop this is the only chance to

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:24,580
stop see the complete process there's no

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:28,870
chance to bring it only a little bit

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:31,420
down or to hold it on on the same level

00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:36,510
because holding it on same level which

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:40,330
still emit carbon dioxyde and which

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:44,590
increase the amount we have an aura in

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:48,990
our air and what would still move on Z

00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:55,870
is the transition to to climate change

00:13:48,990 --> 00:14:00,640
so what can we do and which is mostly

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:03,970
the last part of CFC of a retrospective

00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:09,790
but but I've got more slides here now

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:12,250
what thing would be switched off for

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:15,730
some air force for some people it's just

00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:19,120
the easiest solution I have had those

00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:21,550
conversations with some people too that

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,430
says oh your industry is bad and you

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:26,230
consume so much energy and you can

00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:31,810
switch it off and we we have less

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:34,990
problems in our Bureau yeah this is I so

00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:39,370
that quite stupid conversation from my

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:46,390
point of view because we are part of the

00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:48,270
solution also because we I miss us light

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:50,320
that's it here Oh

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:55,510
unfortunately I put it down instead of

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,850
right and I think ZZ climates like we we

00:14:55,510 --> 00:15:01,000
currently see on the streets wouldn't be

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:03,339
possible with writing letters or

00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,760
something else it's it's just see the

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:09,970
connection we as software developers get

00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:12,810
gives them I know from the Friday's for

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:16,870
future from Germany is a deeply

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:19,240
connected through whatsapp which is cool

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,940
but is they prefer

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,640
from the user perspective and from an on

00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,589
technique to user perspective it is the

00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,370
easiest way to connect them so they have

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:33,820
got big really big groups on whatsapp

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:36,070
and just for announcing stuff and this

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,899
is a technique coming from from the

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:42,580
internet or from from our colleagues

00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:48,580
somewhere it so it would be possible

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:50,980
those those connections and but there

00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:55,470
are other tasks we we could do and we

00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:57,970
should solve to support the the

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:02,350
transformation we need because we need a

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:04,390
lot of there's a lot of stuff to do just

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:06,430
just the transformation for the for the

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:11,140
energy production therefore we need

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:13,510
those smart grids because it we we have

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,360
to reach the point that we have a

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:19,899
decentralized energy production that all

00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:23,290
house how it's maybe have a solar system

00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:28,770
on their roofs and there's all systems

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:32,850
have to be connected because we have to

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:37,810
and for those connections and to not

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:40,839
damage the grid software is needed and

00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:43,990
also data calculation is needed for for

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:47,980
us for some presentation is it seems to

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:51,160
be quite easy but these calculations for

00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,279
for the forecasts are only possible at

00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:01,390
the moment because of of big data

00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:04,390
analysis and analysis and they they are

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:08,520
drawing more and more clear picture of

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:13,329
our future and another thing which

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:15,730
solves a lot of problems doesn't does be

00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:20,980
so clear can be autonomous driving

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:25,360
because I faked the the word or where we

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,429
own a lot of cars is over and I think we

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,500
don't have to own them I just want to

00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:31,720
push a button on my phone and get that

00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,690
car that I currently needed so

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,909
if I just want to go to choose this to

00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,899
the city or to the next Central Station

00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:45,759
I just need a smart car and if I want to

00:17:40,899 --> 00:17:48,190
go to to vacation with my family I've

00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:51,730
got almost three kids so then I would

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:54,460
need a bigger car and this is it's a

00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:56,860
thing which is which is ongoing I think

00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,759
it's a big cities to have it you can

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:04,809
rent your cars but they still stead

00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:06,789
stated that do not come to you so in

00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:11,259
future I think this could solve a lot of

00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:19,990
problems and that is a major task would

00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:22,960
be to bring it down of zero and not it

00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:27,190
each each industry has to do it on their

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:32,470
own or as to head to look on their own

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:35,259
numbers and this is a big and we have

00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,990
got a lot of marketing which tries to

00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:41,710
draw a picture that our cloud

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:46,480
infrastructure may be is very green to

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:48,519
but but it isn't that maybe Google says

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:53,950
they have got a hundred percent of

00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:56,070
universe since two years but we don't

00:18:53,950 --> 00:19:00,210
look at it's a good process because

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:04,330
Google skipped one application in there

00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:09,399
there in the papers is this YouTube and

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:13,389
YouTube is quite good used application

00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:16,230
and the end user also consumes energy so

00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:19,659
when the data centers are green maybe

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:23,889
maybe we can trust them or not but we

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:27,309
should have also looked at the Etsy

00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:32,220
customers and most normal customers do

00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:37,360
not divide or distinct between different

00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:42,840
energy provider so we still have carbon

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,840
in our in in that application

00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:49,970
just as I said it was with cookies the

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:54,600
other club provide us and it had 100%

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,260
AWS is currently at a point of 50% since

00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,630
two years

00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,270
they stopped somehow and nobody knows

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,720
why

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:06,660
yeah maybe it is expensive to do it but

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:11,330
with with that amount of service they

00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:14,870
have it would be also expensive to have

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,670
maybe a text on the carbon dioxide

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:21,960
emission and this would be a solution to

00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:25,890
to to control it a little bit maybe and

00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:30,360
that like samurai like like AWS is Ezra

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:36,360
Ezra is currently at 60% and they said I

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:38,760
want to be at 100 in in 2023 it's the

00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,420
same almost the same for for IBM cloud

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:46,710
and there is a thing mr. developer has

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:51,179
the maybe we have a decision

00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:55,230
and maybe we trust Google or not well we

00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:58,679
can we can make make some power on them

00:20:55,230 --> 00:21:04,380
or get get every AWS on the nose to get

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:09,679
rounded percent also and but there are

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:12,960
smaller things just to you we can do

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,990
this is a kind of a mixture of personal

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,840
things or things our companies can do we

00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:21,960
should check our or provide our electric

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:26,700
tricity provider because we we have a

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:28,679
control over it we can we can buy the

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,410
electricity where we want to buy it and

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:33,300
we can choose we want with handle

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,929
percent to renewables and this would

00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:45,240
make a pressure on the market also same

00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:48,540
as I said is a cloud provider and a good

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:52,020
thing what in my opinion is makes the

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,299
energy consumption visible so the

00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:59,580
easiest way would be just to do

00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:02,499
is easy maybe if your company you have

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,570
monthly reports you and you have got

00:22:02,499 --> 00:22:07,539
reports from an energy provider it's

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:11,289
quite easy to simply copy the number

00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:12,909
from from your bill to to your maybe to

00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:18,239
your kitchen or where you have your

00:22:12,909 --> 00:22:23,200
social area and or draw it in a graph

00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:27,309
one questions I can't really solve at

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:31,059
the moment is to evaluate remote or

00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:34,749
present meetings because if if if we are

00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:36,580
in a company where everybody has to has

00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:39,759
to drive in order to come to the office

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:43,330
and most most of them are driving my

00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:46,779
cars it will be a very very bad

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:49,509
situation because the transport system

00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:53,139
is one of the dirtiest systems we have

00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:55,090
and I saw it as I try to calculate the

00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:57,549
emission of such a conference we are

00:22:55,090 --> 00:23:00,539
here we are having here as they are

00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:06,609
there are some calculators on land and I

00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:09,249
calculated number around 378 tons of

00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:12,009
carbon dioxyde for just the three

00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:15,369
conference days this is quite quite

00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:18,999
quite a lot but it's not the conference

00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:22,210
itself 300 tons of them is just for you

00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:24,429
transport it's just I do not really know

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:28,659
how you come here but it's just the

00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:31,450
average that is used for calculations

00:23:28,659 --> 00:23:33,940
there some of you are still located in

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,470
Berlin some of you flight over here to

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:42,639
from New York and so the number of him

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:44,379
comes it's the same the same factor for

00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:48,759
the energy consumption of maybe of a

00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:51,249
company is the is the transport of the

00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:55,029
employees to Z company and so the easy

00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:56,830
question must to be solved if if it

00:23:55,029 --> 00:24:01,139
would be better to have remote meetings

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,139
or to have more home office

00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:09,169
in favor of or instead of present

00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:12,830
meetings that we have different social

00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:17,149
situations and is is clear we have to

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:19,369
solve this problem also but says there's

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:22,159
a way between between remote and present

00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:24,409
maybe can be to connect some of the

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,679
colleagues in some kind of co-working

00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,720
spaces so not everybody or not the

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,210
complete company has to come to a single

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,789
space we divide these bases and

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,979
co-working spaces so we still have

00:24:34,789 --> 00:24:41,200
colleagues there or other people to talk

00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:45,080
with because having home office

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,470
350 days a year this isn't it good for

00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:54,789
for socializing and mostly coding is

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:54,789
some kind of social interaction also and

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:07,210
we all know technical depth it's it's

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:12,799
it's it's way known abstraction when we

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:13,970
write dirty codes or when we just do it

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,999
quick it dirty

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:20,989
and it's it's a thing we we try to solve

00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:24,950
and by creating maybe a ticket and doing

00:25:20,989 --> 00:25:28,309
it later mostly it doesn't work but so

00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:30,979
steps are way known in our in our

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:33,830
industry that's that said I even known

00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:37,359
not only known among us to developers so

00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:40,519
even on through our business people

00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:45,529
customers because they can calculate

00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:49,220
them and but that's anybody care about

00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:53,479
these easy depths we we have to pay for

00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:57,049
for climate damage no nobody knows about

00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:59,299
those numbers and because nobody

00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:02,779
calculates it but who has to pay so

00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:07,429
steps we have to pay those steps

00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:10,339
who has got children here so you

00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:12,259
children and me to have to pay those

00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:14,419
steps and the price will be really

00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:15,049
really high and this is this is a thing

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:19,759
we we have

00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:22,789
to take in our head and with this is the

00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:26,330
frame which motivates me to work for

00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:30,529
this to support the movement and to do

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:32,149
those things to avoid the situations

00:26:30,529 --> 00:26:36,230
that my children have to pay the steps

00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:39,230
that my children effort future and so I

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:43,489
would like to give some examples because

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:45,919
it was a might idea to to to create some

00:26:43,489 --> 00:26:48,470
kind of a price tag some of the

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:53,330
calculations are easy some of them are

00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:56,299
not that easy and one one price is

00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:59,509
really low it's just one hour YouTube

00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:02,559
streaming is less than one cent to pay

00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:07,909
for and where do I get the number from

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:10,929
well the number is still was a factor to

00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:15,200
calculate those those amount is

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:19,570
currently 180 euros per on C carbon

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:24,129
dioxyde so this number comes from even

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:26,779
this number come in from our government

00:27:24,129 --> 00:27:29,539
and from the scientists but the

00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:32,960
government doesn't want to realize they

00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:36,710
own that first and one or a t heroes

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,749
this chest the amount of money which is

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,509
representation for the damage we are

00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:47,179
making when emitting 1 ton carbon

00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:50,590
dioxyde so it's it's it's it could be

00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:56,960
that easy because we could simply pay it

00:27:50,590 --> 00:28:01,340
instead of instead of just not seeing it

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,080
but we have a political problem at the

00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,409
moment in germany there are countries

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:09,649
which have those kind of texas because

00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:13,039
the numbers aren't that high yes you see

00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:16,940
the example for for youtube streaming if

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,399
u stream higher videos with higher

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,070
resolutions like Netflix's number gets a

00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:25,850
little bit higher sure but this is that

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:27,530
high you for driving a car 500

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:31,900
kilometers

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:34,760
with an average car is about a two years

00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,240
materials is not that high and not that

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:41,420
big

00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:43,580
the same is for flight a flight from

00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,490
Berlin to Munich somebody going back

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:52,850
tonight from Berlin to in Munich just

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:57,260
for Zurich you would admit 190 kilogram

00:28:52,850 --> 00:29:00,290
carbon dioxyde dioxyde and so you you

00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:04,880
would have to pay a tax about four euros

00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:08,360
this isn't that high it will be really

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:12,740
high for energy providers which which

00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:15,350
really emit an amount of of carbon

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,020
dioxyde but but therefore those textures

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:21,679
are to control it and to give to give it

00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:25,640
a plastic to give it a value and I think

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,120
our capitalistic system only understands

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:35,110
things if it has a value there's no way

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,110
to do it there's no other way to do it

00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,660
there are more examples for those

00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:53,540
calculations there a lot of calculators

00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:57,559
around the internet to to calculate the

00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:01,070
carbon dioxyde admission for action Ickx

00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:06,730
as i looked for for the YouTube value I

00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:10,130
struck it about a real repaper about

00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:12,860
these the hype routers Kangnam style

00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:16,130
video on YouTube this was was an example

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:20,840
or much as how big is the carbon dioxide

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:24,200
emission was there and yeah we another

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,429
thing we should think about is our

00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:31,690
development culture I don't know if

00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:36,550
there is any other industry which has

00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:41,250
such a it's not strange but such a

00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:43,350
culture like like like having kids or

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:46,890
against because we have so many gimmicks

00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:50,760
so many extra things other industries

00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:52,440
doesn't have we we have some kinds of as

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,270
most companies or some companies have

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,760
some kinds of slack days where we can

00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:00,570
practice all things we we have

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:05,010
playgrounds and our offices just to get

00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:06,960
you developers working we we are going

00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:10,650
on conferences and then we have got play

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,320
gods - or parties or something else it's

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:16,020
it's it's it's a kiya trial it's it's

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,460
it's it's cool for socializing but it

00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:21,780
also is some kind of luxury I think I

00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:24,060
would think we I would say we should

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:27,930
avoid some things but we should think

00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:31,860
about it when when having those luxury

00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:37,710
things because we we we emit carbon

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:42,510
dioxyde the same is I think for the cons

00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:47,880
a consumer behaviour we as developers

00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:50,970
and all the complete digitalization is a

00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:55,800
big factor to do things right to do

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:59,250
things better and to emit less carbon

00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:01,890
dioxyde because just these the invention

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:06,930
of eBook readers like saying like the

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:11,130
kinder wood soft soft a problem because

00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:13,500
books also emit carbon dioxyde in the

00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:18,540
production in the transport and so on if

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:22,640
you if you read your books on an e-book

00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:27,030
reader you would need about 30 books to

00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:31,080
to be on the same level and every other

00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:35,250
book would would be positive on your on

00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,200
your climate footprint so we say this

00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:40,260
height let's call it a dematerialization

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,770
of of things because the book isn't

00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:46,560
there anymore we have it in our in our

00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:50,090
device what problem is there that all

00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:53,190
devices not listed long anymore so we

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:54,930
most people change their smartphones

00:32:53,190 --> 00:32:57,990
every two years since this

00:32:54,930 --> 00:33:03,300
this period is quite a short - to

00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:08,550
compensate the production and the the

00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:11,040
emission for for those devices and when

00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:14,700
we when we as developers or when the

00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:19,170
digitalization makes some some some

00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:22,130
steps new codes in maybe and making

00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:28,370
things better we compensated by consume

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:31,050
so a good example is streaming I think

00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:34,890
the amount of hours we are looking we

00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:37,350
are currently looking videos or Phil we

00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:39,450
are currently watching TV compared to

00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:43,110
the time where we only have video

00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:46,350
cassettes is it's it's it is quite

00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:55,760
awesome how many how big this number is

00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:59,610
so we we try to - - we will place the

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,700
for Isaac has a video by by a digital

00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:04,970
thing which which is quite cool for for

00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:08,000
the environment but then we increase the

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:16,890
consumption in amount which is

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:20,310
incredible laughing I want to mention

00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:23,970
here as a things we can do is to become

00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:32,040
politically we are currently in a very

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:36,300
very very strange situation we have kids

00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:40,230
on the streets that that that try to to

00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,950
to get their future back and we have so

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:46,350
this is so less support from the parents

00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:51,620
there are organizations that are called

00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:55,590
parents that are quite less but Zizi

00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:58,980
could be even more so this is a major

00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:02,490
thing - to make all aware to speak about

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:06,720
it - to go on the strikes also to

00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:08,370
support them because supporting those

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,070
those movements

00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:14,300
isn't only then through going to the

00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:16,790
strike we can also support them by

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,530
argumentation and social media because

00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:22,380
some of those of the leaders of those

00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:27,480
strikes really get travel was even with

00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:29,940
politicians and it's it's it's awesome

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:36,110
how bad those communications or azad

00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:36,110
arguments are in the social media and

00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:44,160
each would call it industry or each part

00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:47,640
of our society has some kind of created

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:52,110
some kind of organization to support the

00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,930
children on street or our parents can go

00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:57,830
to the parents for future or scientists

00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:01,880
can go to the scientists for future and

00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:04,860
even the the business guys here are

00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:08,040
collected in an organization called

00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:10,800
entrepreneurs for future and say they

00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:15,630
are really interested in supporting the

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,250
kids and also interested to to transform

00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,740
their own companies and this is quite

00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:23,850
cool because this sorry business guys

00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:26,160
are doing it right and left one over at

00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:31,800
the at the end because we are developers

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:35,100
and there's also this one there's also

00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,430
an organization called developers for

00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:43,740
future where developers can put in their

00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:49,050
effort the organization I have found

00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:50,880
that I think six weeks ago and I also

00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,440
created Twitter handle and this is my

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,780
first Twitter handle I can't control

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,440
anymore because the timeline is running

00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,500
that fast

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,880
Aziz the input is set fast is this it's

00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:06,000
quite awesome and there we we have got

00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:09,930
little software projects to to support

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,700
this movement for example we write we

00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:13,230
currently are writing as a subscription

00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:15,420
form for the scientists for future

00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,370
forward campaign because they have had a

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,670
campaign here in Germany and they

00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:21,430
extended it to the word so it's just

00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:26,700
little

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:31,450
form for a subscription we also create a

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:34,650
a kind of support system to to organize

00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:38,319
supporters or to organize resources

00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:41,260
which are needed for for some events as

00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:42,970
they don't on they don't they do not

00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:44,530
have only strikes they only have got

00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:46,960
more events as they go on cleaning

00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:52,089
events on Saturday they have their

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:54,130
preparations and so on and there's a lot

00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:56,920
of tasks to do it it's quite like a open

00:37:54,130 --> 00:38:00,520
source community I would call it we also

00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:05,520
take only take on source stuff we try to

00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:09,220
make it it often it as open as possible

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,660
yeah so if you like to join I would be

00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:16,420
very happy because it's it's very good

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:20,220
good reason and we all should do

00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:22,450
something either by joining some of the

00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,990
organization by joining the strikers on

00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:33,230
the street because if we do nothing it's

00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:37,340
game over and my talk is over Center

00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:37,340
[Applause]

00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:54,489
[Music]

00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:54,489
