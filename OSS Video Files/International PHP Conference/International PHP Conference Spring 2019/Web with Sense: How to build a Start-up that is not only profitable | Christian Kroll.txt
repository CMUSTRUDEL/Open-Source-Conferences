Publication date: 2019-10-02
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Christian Kroll (Ecosia) | https://phpconference.com/speaker/christian-kroll/

Christian is the founder of Ecosia, the search engine that plants trees. He launched Ecosia after a one-year trip around the world to help people in developing countries and become proactive about climate change. The Berlin-based search engine now has over fourty employees and the company generates millions in sales, which translates into a tree being planted every second. In his lecture, Christian shows how to set up a social enterprise and discusses the hurdles you’ll have to overcome.

[Music]

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,480
all right thank you all for being here

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,509
especially after the lunch break I hope

00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,599
you're all fit and ready to take up some

00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:18,300
content before I start I just would like

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,359
to know who already knew a cozia before

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:24,119
coming here let's see awesome that's

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,519
great so for those of you who don't know

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,349
who we are and what we do and it goes

00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,020
use a search engine it basically works

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:35,730
like oh that was the wrong button and

00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:39,120
I'm not a technical person as you can

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,410
see and so let's try that and so it goes

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,670
there's a search engine it basically

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,980
works like Google you type in your

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,840
search terms and when you hit the search

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,860
button we show your search results also

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,420
like Google when you click on so next to

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,910
the search results we also show display

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,649
advertisements and when you click on one

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,629
of these advertisements then we make

00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,460
money so far everything the same as

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,160
Google the big difference though between

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,589
us and Google is that we use that money

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,570
to actually plant trees and this is how

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,180
we've already planted almost sixty

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,560
million trees with just our small

00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,710
company so it's pretty awesome I think

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,710
thank you

00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:23,000
so we're planting trees in areas where

00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:24,740
they're most needed like here in burkina

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,140
faso for example where we're basically

00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:30,829
turning the desert into into forests

00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,509
again and why is that important for the

00:01:30,829 --> 00:01:35,810
local people who live in these villages

00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:38,329
nearby this is basically a life-changing

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,219
event so for them it means that suddenly

00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:43,130
they can generate income again suddenly

00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:44,600
they have access to water again and it

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,189
basically also in the end means that

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,170
they can send their kids to school this

00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:50,090
is really a fundamental change for the

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,329
local people in the countries that we

00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:55,119
are working in we of course also do this

00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:58,579
because we want to fight climate change

00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,110
every tree we calculate takes around 50

00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:01,579
kilograms of co2 out of the atmosphere

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:04,069
during its lifetime

00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:07,520
and if you plan 60 million trees that's

00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:09,890
quite a lot of co2 so I personally think

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,500
that we can't solve the climate crisis

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:15,650
if you don't plant a lot of trees and

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,959
buy a lot of trees I actually mean 1

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,099
trillion trees that is one thousand

00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,190
billion for those of you who are not

00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:24,319
comfortable or who don't know the

00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:27,650
translation of 1 trillion

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,810
quite a lot so we currently on our

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:33,410
planet have space for around 1.2

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:36,620
trillion trees and if we plant these 1.2

00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:38,269
trillion trees then we solve climate

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,850
change basically we also solve poverty

00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:43,459
to a large extent and we also solve

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,260
hunger and the problem that there is not

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:47,780
enough access to water and on this

00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,200
planet and the best thing about this is

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:53,209
that we would only need around 1% of the

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,980
global military budget for the next 20

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,260
years to actually do that for me that's

00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:59,090
a complete no-brainer so I could even

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,519
stop my presentation here now and you

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,290
all call your local food editions or and

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,419
tell them that they please put more

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,980
money into tree planting but I'm also I

00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:11,150
would like to tell you a bit more about

00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:13,579
us the company behind this tree planting

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,489
activity so we're a balloon based

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:19,160
startup to show you some numbers we

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:21,410
currently make around 20 million euros

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,440
in revenue every year and we have around

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:27,859
10 million monthly active users and we

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,620
are according to Alexa we're on Alexa

00:03:27,859 --> 00:03:31,069
rank 480 which means we're among the 500

00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,510
biggest

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:34,640
websites on the planet in terms of

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,099
traffic that also means that we're the

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,170
biggest Europe European search engine

00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:41,030
and it also means that we are the

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,620
biggest environmental website in the

00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,909
world

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,909
unfortunately I hope there were I wish

00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,980
there were more we have a team quite a

00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:50,959
small team here in Berlin of 35 people

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,980
we're hiring by the way and especially

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,540
developers if you're interested and yeah

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,299
I'll cross trajectory it looks pretty

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,310
good we have since January we grew by

00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,409
almost 50 percent in revenue and it

00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:06,500
seems like it's gonna continue like that

00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:09,439
as I said so far we planted almost 60

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,760
million trees which is yeah that's what

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,909
we're what were there for that's what

00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,949
why we're actually doing this and I want

00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:20,090
to give you a bit of a background how

00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:22,430
this company was created since we were a

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,320
very small group here I want to show you

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:28,039
some pictures from my private life

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:32,930
I started it cozia almost ten years ago

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:34,870
now and before I started it I actually

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,729
studied Business Administration and

00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,860
during my studies I realized that I

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:41,840
don't want to follow the typical career

00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,759
path but I rather that want to do

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,370
something different and the problem was

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,720
that I didn't really know what I want to

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,169
do with my life basically

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,570
so I spent almost one and a half years

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,729
traveling around the world so I spent

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,759
half a year living in Nepal there you

00:04:55,729 --> 00:05:02,080
see some of the pictures and there I

00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:05,259
realized that Nepal is one of the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,970
financially oricon economic economically

00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:10,669
poorest countries in the world and they

00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,710
realized how fortunate I was to be born

00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:14,780
in Germany so I met a lot of people who

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,240
were smarter and I who were working

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,210
harder than I and nevertheless they

00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,159
would never get to the same quality of

00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,840
life that I had they would never get the

00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:27,500
chance to actually travel the world and

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,630
visit other countries so that made me

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,090
aware of this big global injustice that

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,729
we have on our planet unfortunately I

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,710
also continue travelling then and I

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:39,949
spend almost one year in in South

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,860
America and there I saw with my own eyes

00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,780
the destruction that we're doing on our

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,220
planet the environmental destruction

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,140
so I was driving for hours and hours

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:54,260
next to big big soil plantations that

00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,030
are basically green deserts on places

00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:58,760
where there used to be a wonderful rain

00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:02,000
forest so I saw these two things and I

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,500
wanted to do something against it and I

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,290
was also very interested in tech but

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,930
also already as a small child I was kind

00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,880
of putting together computers

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,860
unfortunately not to program but to play

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,120
computer games but still I knew how to

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:19,250
put together computers and I was for me

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,840
it was quite obvious back then that the

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,960
tech companies the big tank companies

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,540
especially Google will - logics extent

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,760
dominate our our our lives in the future

00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,850
so yeah I wanted to do something that

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:34,250
helps people helps the planet and also

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,800
does something with search so I've

00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,600
decided why not start a search engine

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,550
that plans trees that is basically the

00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,430
story how that came up the problem was

00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:44,870
that I didn't know how to start a search

00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:46,940
engine and I also didn't know how to

00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,290
plant trees but still I was young and

00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,229
foolish enough to actually just get

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:53,600
started so when I came back to Berlin I

00:06:51,229 --> 00:06:56,479
found a few people who were crazy enough

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,910
to to work with me on this we were

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,320
walking we were working in a in an

00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,930
office if you can call it that way

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,090
actually was just the storage room of a

00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:08,180
mosaic workshop but we were working

00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:10,550
there and had a lot of fun and actually

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:12,740
almost after maybe just half a year we

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,620
had the first version of a cozy up and

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,440
running and it wasn't the most beautiful

00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:21,620
website on the internet but still it was

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,840
live and we got some feedback from

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:27,050
people who really liked what we were

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,150
doing but still since we didn't have any

00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,979
external investments it took us quite

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:35,060
some time to actually build this up and

00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:38,270
then also get it yeah get it to get to

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:41,180
get it to get more traction so I started

00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:43,910
a cozia in 2009 and it took us almost

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,400
four years to actually get to 1 million

00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:47,780
trees so that was one of the points

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,940
where we of course we had a big

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,430
celebration we had a big party and we

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,800
were all happy about our 1 million trees

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,289
planted but we also realized that 1

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,280
million trees basically on the global

00:07:57,289 --> 00:07:59,990
scale is in

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,780
not enough we just need to do a lot more

00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,760
and that was actually the point when we

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,919
made the first change to the ecology

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,740
business model we used to give eighty

00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,930
percent of all our revenues to tree

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,180
planting which in hindsight was just

00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,130
crazy and because that basically meant

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,960
that we never could pay these in

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:20,810
salaries neither to me nor to the people

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,940
who were working at the company it also

00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,830
meant that at the end of the month there

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,340
was never money left over to do any

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:29,510
investments in some months even just the

00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,940
cost for service and so on

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,580
were more than we 10 the 20% that we

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,830
actually set aside for our own cost so

00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:38,750
that was the point when we when the

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,580
company was four years old and reached 1

00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,450
million trees where we actually

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,950
communicated to our users that we want

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,900
to change that model and then we're

00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:46,880
going to give all of our profits to tree

00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,560
planting in the future we thought that

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,589
our users would be outraged but they

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,670
were actually really positive about that

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:54,050
and said yeah that's awesome of course

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,930
you need to immediately make investments

00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:58,220
and within just a few months we actually

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:00,620
reached a point where we were planting

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,020
more trees under the new model even

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,580
though we gave a lower percentage the

00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,020
cake in a way got bigger so that we

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,910
could give money more money to tree

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:10,220
planting and that was actually the point

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,780
when it cozia started turning into a

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,760
real company I would say where we could

00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,040
really afford a decent office for

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,520
example and also paying decent salaries

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:22,820
to people so now we're as I said a team

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,940
of 35 people we have a wonderful office

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,640
in in the core fill in with a ping-pong

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,350
table free breakfast on Wednesdays and

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,070
everything that you need to be a hip

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,839
belt in startup so yeah that's really

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,089
awesome so but it took us a while to get

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,800
there because we didn't have investment

00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:42,140
money to build all that up but we always

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,760
had to generate them funds for these

00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:49,150
kind of investments from our own cash

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,680
flow but ecozy has also this which is

00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:53,450
the tree planting projects so when I say

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,700
that we have 35 people working at the

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,320
company I'm not counting the thousands

00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,089
of people who are actually planting the

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,860
trees for us and this is actually

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:05,300
probably the much much more difficult

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,880
work so for me it's really interesting I

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,530
try to go at least once a year to one of

00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,480
these three planting projects to observe

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,990
all the positive impact that we're

00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,240
having there

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,120
for me it's really mind-blowing every

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:20,570
time that I have a chance to go there

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,370
it's also just fun to be a CEO of a

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,470
search engine that plans trees which are

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,020
two completely different worlds

00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:30,800
I picked this picture here because there

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:34,970
I was sitting on a pickup while visiting

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,560
our project in Indonesia and maybe 2 or

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,840
3 minutes after that picture was taken

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,130
actually the whole pickup just was

00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,990
driving through a river and actually

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:45,530
fell over and we all landed in the river

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,670
so that's not the typical kind of event

00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:48,560
that you usually have when you work at

00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,490
an internet startup so it's really good

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,530
to see that I mean it's it's amazing

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,270
experiences but it's also it shows you

00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,740
that many many people on these on this

00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,840
planet actually have to actually have

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,970
very very different problems to the

00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,130
problems that we that we all here have

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,290
so and it also makes me very humble and

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:08,660
grateful for the opportunities that I

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,040
have and gives me the motivation that I

00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:12,200
need to yeah

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:16,160
keep working hard and even harder if

00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,720
possible so yeah we're trying to plant a

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,780
lot of trees that's our core mission but

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:22,900
we're also trying to do other things

00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:25,820
you've probably heard about this forest

00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:27,980
which is the forest of Humber who have

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,560
views from Germany here do who knows

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,360
this forests yes I'll give it a little

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,490
bit of a background this is an ancient

00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:38,780
old-growth forest that is standing right

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:40,790
next to Europe's biggest opencast coal

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:45,200
mine which is run by an energy company

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,430
called out of EE and they want to extend

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,250
their production so they want to cut

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:50,030
down that forest and there was a lot of

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,570
demonstrations so that this shouldn't

00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:55,790
happen and we also as a company we

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:57,710
discussed while having beers what we

00:11:55,790 --> 00:12:00,340
could do to maybe help protect that

00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:02,570
forest so and at some point somebody

00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,420
basically jokingly said hey we could

00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:10,160
just buy the forest and we died what a

00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:13,670
stupid idea let's do it so we extend an

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,740
offer to buy the forest of Humber for 1

00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,020
million euro and unfortunately out of

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,970
you didn't accept our offer but still it

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,940
generated a lot of attention to the

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,460
topic again so a lot of German and also

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:29,090
international press asked

00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:31,730
if our we should still be allowed to own

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:34,390
that forest or even cut it down so I

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:36,260
think we did our small share to to

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,030
hopefully make sure that this forest

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,220
actually raised will stay standing and

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:42,800
that for me is important that we as a

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,560
company also take our responsibility not

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,560
only to further develop our own business

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,080
but to have change in society as a whole

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,150
and another thing that we did last year

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:59,300
actually was that we turned a cozia into

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,040
one of the first purpose companies what

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,650
is that a purpose company basically is a

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:07,010
normal limited liability company or

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:09,800
again behalf and you give one share of

00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,810
you come one percent of your company to

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:14,270
a purpose foundation that's how they're

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,400
called and they in return get veto

00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,440
rights so that you can never sell your

00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,390
company you can never take any profits

00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,460
out of your company you can never change

00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:24,530
the purpose of a company and people who

00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,850
own shares always have to be people who

00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,070
actually work at the company so the

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,370
control is with people actually within

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,990
the company a lot of investors not many

00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,760
investors are around here probably

00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,290
wouldn't like that idea very much but

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,640
for us it just felt the right thing to

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:43,730
do because for me this is basically the

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,710
answer to 12 Oh capitalism I think we

00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,110
have shifted a bit too far to a system

00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,730
that is just for the sake of profits

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,420
destroying our planet and I think

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:56,120
companies like this like these could be

00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:57,860
partially the answer to the crisis that

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,170
I think we have at the moment and it's

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:04,520
really so basically I want to put that

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:06,050
effect in sorry um Wow yeah so basically

00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,340
a Cosi has not for sale and I think

00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,840
that's that's very important because

00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,420
we're more we're becoming more than a

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,640
than a normal company we're becoming a

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,160
movement I hope we are already one of

00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,410
the biggest environmental movements of

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,500
the planet and that also comes with a

00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,990
responsibility and just me and my my

00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,370
business partner Tim we just decided

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,650
that we should not have the right to

00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,350
sell this to anybody even though that

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:33,380
even though that means to say no to a

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:35,200
lot of money it's still felt for us that

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,000
it this would be the right thing to do

00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,600
yes and then also that meant that a lot

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,720
of people

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,640
talked about this step which gave us a

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,940
lot of fabulous publicity which is great

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,220
but also now I have basically every week

00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,840
somebody who is a founder of a company

00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,360
or people are planning to found

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,490
companies who want to take that 10 same

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:58,340
direction who basically wants to give

00:14:55,490 --> 00:15:00,020
away their company and make it turn it

00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,970
into a non profit company so I think

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,620
that's that's really great I think

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,810
everything for cozia is really just

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,420
going awesomely well everything's

00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:12,170
perfect but I'm not hundred percent

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:15,500
satisfied because of this who knows what

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:20,900
that is it is I see a hand over there

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:23,180
just shout it exactly this is global

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,970
temperatures during the last more less

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:30,530
100 years so this is a different kind of

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:32,030
chart as you see we're already in the

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:36,470
middle of climate change climate change

00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,850
has already begun and I think a lot of

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,510
people don't know what that actually

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:44,210
means for me climate change is the most

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:46,160
underestimated existential threat even

00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:49,340
though now a lot of people are talking

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,480
about it I still think that most most

00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,560
people haven't understood what this

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:58,520
actually means we're currently like

00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:00,140
really on a path to extinction and if we

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,390
don't change something within the next

00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:06,320
five years then it will be then it will

00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:08,390
basically be too late so and I don't see

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,070
that change happening yet I see a lot of

00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,630
action now on the streets but which

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:13,640
medium really makes me happy but I hope

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:17,180
that this topic becomes even more

00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:20,470
important so that we just find a way to

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,540
avoid catastrophic climate collapse

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:26,720
because that would really be the biggest

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,060
failure of our generation I think so

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,340
we're trying to be we as a cosa we try

00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:33,140
to be one of the biggest forces to

00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,390
actually help find crack fight climate

00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:38,690
change so I try to I like that picture

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,100
by dellacroix a lot but I try to improve

00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,630
it a little bit with my photoshop skills

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:47,570
so there you go and so that's what we're

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:50,630
trying to be we try to lead by example

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,710
we're 100% we use 100% renewable energy

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:55,370
since

00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:58,220
since the company existed basically also

00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:02,810
we always put our purpose before before

00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:05,000
profit we treat our people well we yeah

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:08,900
don't buy stuff that we don't need we

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,190
fly almost never so yeah we're trying to

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,209
be a role model and also try to

00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:15,860
encourage others to you have to make

00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:17,030
sure that we win this fight against

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,830
climate change and I'm really happy

00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:20,240
about the movement that is currently

00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:22,850
happening on the streets and I think we

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,350
should all support that I'm I think

00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,200
there's also something like developers

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,750
for the future right maybe you want to

00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:32,210
join this I think it goes there's

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,760
actually gonna join it so yeah that's

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,910
who we are and what we are what we're

00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,970
trying to do I think I have around 10

00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:43,820
minutes left so I want to do a little

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,830
experiment with you um because the

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,420
reason why I'm here is of course that

00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,640
you all know a cosy about what what is

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,070
actually more important to me that you

00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,260
maybe try to help us solve this climate

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:57,620
crisis so I want to do a little

00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:59,720
experiment I will give you one minute

00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:02,500
now so that you can maybe think about

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:06,260
what you could do in your personal lives

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,300
to help solve the climate crisis and I

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,890
advise you not to skip that step because

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,800
then in the second step you would not

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,940
look very he would not look very good so

00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,440
I will was just time one minute now and

00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,890
yeah take some time to think about what

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,890
you can do

00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,650
okay so that one minute is up and now

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:29,510
it's time for step number two which is I

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,330
think you're all here for networking as

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:33,650
well so step number two is that you that

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,260
out of time another minute so that you

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,730
take 30 seconds each to tell the person

00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,670
sitting next to you what you actually

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,440
just decided that you want to do so I

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,460
hope you actually thought about it in

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,460
the first place

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,190
[Applause]

00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,960
awesome I hope you had a great

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,150
conversation and I hope you can even

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,090
continue that after after this session

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,980
is over it's really it feels very

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:11,870
difficult for me to interrupt a

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,910
discussion about sustainability so I

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:18,350
hope you keep continuing that afterwards

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,810
so now we have around five more minutes

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,540
and I just I was wondering if some of

00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:25,070
you maybe has questions about a cozia

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,860
about what we're trying to do about

00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,790
anything else so we have a few

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,650
microphones in the audience and it's

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:36,500
Rihanna and Bao helping us with

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:39,680
microphones so please in case maybe you

00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,810
point on on the people and then you get

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,350
it right microphones in that can

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:48,320
everybody can hear you thank you and I

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,810
was wondering is there a process that

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,460
you take to make sure that the trees

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:55,670
that you're planting are staying there

00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:57,290
how do you maintain them like do you

00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:58,610
plant them but how do you make sure that

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:01,610
they stay there that they're growing

00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:03,530
that they're getting water yeah so I

00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:05,300
mean when we say we've planted 60

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:08,210
million trees then these are trees that

00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:11,300
actually survive so we planted a lot

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:14,570
more we basically if you want to make

00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:15,980
sure that trees survive you have to make

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,890
sure that they provide value to the

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:22,730
people living in that area and that is

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:26,420
our main criterion when it comes to

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:28,160
evaluating projects that apply you

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:32,000
basically need to make sure that people

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:33,950
understand that they can get yeah

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,010
economic benefits usually out of out of

00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:39,290
the forests that we're planting then it

00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:41,390
could still go wrong but the likelihood

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,950
of failure is much lower and the

00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,810
techniques really depend on the region

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:47,180
and some areas you we usually don't

00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:50,180
water trees because that would be very

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:52,520
very expensive but in some areas we just

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,410
take little little holes into the ground

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:55,880
and throw seeds into these holes and

00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:57,620
then when it rains the water comes and

00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:59,090
other areas you don't need to worry

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,630
about water at all because it rains

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:03,080
every day so yeah it really depends but

00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:04,970
we have

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:06,230
somebody at a tea cosy ah who in my

00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,380
opinion has the greatest job in the

00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:11,419
world he's our tree planting officer and

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,409
I applied for that position but I wasn't

00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:17,360
I wasn't qualified

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:18,890
unfortunately so he he is looking after

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,179
our project and setting all these

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,940
criteria I mean there are other criteria

00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:24,860
as well that we don't use that we don't

00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,649
plan any monocultures or do you don't

00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:31,940
use chemicals and our projects fair

00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:34,279
treatment of when men and women no child

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:36,740
labor and so on so all these things also

00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:38,149
criteria but survival is of course the

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,549
biggest challenge and there you need to

00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:46,789
make sure you meet the needs of the

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:48,710
people I can't really see maybe use some

00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:55,789
I'm making it very difficult for the

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:58,419
microphone now yes compared to Google

00:23:55,789 --> 00:24:01,850
your your company seems rather tiny so

00:23:58,419 --> 00:24:03,740
what do you think about the quality of

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:06,769
your search results because I think that

00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:08,600
is vital to any search engine for

00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:10,340
whatever purpose you maintain is so

00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:14,779
would you say that the the search

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,580
results are equivalent or close to the

00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:19,010
quality of the results of the the

00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:21,889
biggest search engine yes so we unmixed

00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,330
yeah yeah so this is also this is a big

00:24:21,889 --> 00:24:24,639
challenge number two so you pointed

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,769
these ultimate out very well

00:24:24,639 --> 00:24:29,960
so we're working together with Microsoft

00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:31,700
to access their search algorithm if we

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,440
were not able to do that then I think

00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,630
the whole company wouldn't be possible

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,220
because you need billions of dollars of

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,309
investment to actually make a decent

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,990
search engine and on top of that we're

00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,090
building other things so we basically

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:45,919
depend on Microsoft's index which

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,559
fortunately has improved a lot over the

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,539
last years and it's getting very very

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,250
competitive I would say I'm also

00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:55,669
sometimes using Google don't tell anyone

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,440
and so but the number of Google searches

00:24:55,669 --> 00:25:00,380
that I'm doing has really reduced over

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,450
the last years so but we of course we

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,460
have to try to keep up not only with the

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,590
search quality but also we have to build

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,269
a lot of apps a lot of additional

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,850
software we have ten million monthly

00:25:08,269 --> 00:25:12,460
users now so stability of the side is a

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:15,799
big big problem and we have a team of

00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,850
thing 15 developers maybe 20 developers

00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,429
now so

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,590
that's really a lot to handle for very

00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:29,690
very few people so we need great great

00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:32,049
people so that's I think Aki Christine

00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:34,610
thank you so much for a very inspiring

00:25:32,049 --> 00:25:36,169
presentation Letitia want someone short

00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:38,779
he goes there that I mentioned yesterday

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:42,350
what I was wondering do you guys to use

00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:44,720
research and research and how do you

00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:47,360
mean for what do you talk to your users

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,070
do you see why I want to be sustainable

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,220
why I want to search with your search

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,110
engine do it yeah so we have also UX

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,559
people at the company I think three UX

00:25:54,110 --> 00:26:03,320
positions and yeah they have of us

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:05,600
figure out what what people want all

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:18,919
right then I think time is over as well

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:21,820
soon one one one the back maybe how do

00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,059
you make sure that the ground you're

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:30,049
planting the trees the ground that is

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:32,840
owned by people that support your

00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:37,789
company and that it's ground that it's

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:40,730
not heard by any industry when the trees

00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:42,500
are planted yeah so the the land that we

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,480
plant our trees on is usually owned by

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,009
the communities and we make a long-term

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,929
agreement with these communities so

00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:53,870
usually 30 40 50 years we agree together

00:26:50,929 --> 00:26:56,029
with them that the trees can't be cut

00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,929
down and also the land can't be bought

00:26:56,029 --> 00:26:58,279
by anybody else

00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:02,450
of course we're working in countries

00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:04,639
where agreements are difficult to I mean

00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,110
not to make but then really to to follow

00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:08,149
up on them if they are broken

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,830
that's sometimes challenging but so far

00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:13,370
we didn't have any big problems there

00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:15,559
because maybe you don't have a good law

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,230
system in many of these countries but

00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:19,970
usually trust and honor is something

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,919
that is very important to a lot of

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,379
communities in in developing countries

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,799
so if you have a good conversation with

00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:29,380
the people really on an eye-to-eye on a

00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,750
level then then a

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:34,330
so far that hasn't been a problem for us

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:36,910
and we would we would never take away

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,920
land from people who I don't know so

00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,710
that they can't do farming on it anymore

00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,800
we just take land that is not used or

00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:49,420
not useful for the villages okay so it's

00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:52,390
safe country safe country for the for

00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:55,900
the plot the trees so to speak yes yeah

00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:58,809
and you're still organizing further

00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:01,630
communities to make the movement grow

00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,200
yes so we need if you want to change

00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,490
your job

00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,840
we need more tree planting projects so

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,150
unfortunately they're not enough tree

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,130
planting initiatives on this planet

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,920
which is especially worrying since we

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:18,130
need to plant these one points these one

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,290
trillion trees so yeah there are a lot

00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,670
of people who want to do it but really

00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:23,500
good organizations who can do it at

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,590
scale at very low cost with a high

00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,670
survival rate then not so many actually

00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:33,100
which is a problem okay thank you so

00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:34,720
thank you very much I think afterwards

00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:37,270
is also possibility to talk to Christian

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,790
hopefully so we are all going now to be

00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,490
the cozier users if you're not already

00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:44,320
