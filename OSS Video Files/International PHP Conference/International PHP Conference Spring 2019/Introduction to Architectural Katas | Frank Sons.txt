Everyone wants a good architecture, so most of us learned all about design patterns, microservices and all the other important things. But with the raise of DDD it is getting more obvious again: We need to focus more on understanding the functional requirements and specifications instead of thinking too much about the solution. This doesn‚Äôt mean we need to go back to the "Big Design Up Front" days of waterfall, but it seems that agile made us forget that some planning is actually quite useful. Most of the time we haven‚Äôt even understood the problem before we start coding. I want to show how Architectural Katas can help us train methods like events storming or to focus more on requirements in general.
