Title: Introduction to Architectural Katas | Frank Sons
Publication date: 2019-10-10
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Frank Sons (Agile Software & Code Quality) | https://phpconference.com/speaker/frank-sons/

Everyone wants a good architecture, so most of us learned all about design patterns, microservices and all the other important things. But with the raise of DDD it is getting more obvious again: We need to focus more on understanding the functional requirements and specifications instead of thinking too much about the solution. This doesn’t mean we need to go back to the "Big Design Up Front" days of waterfall, but it seems that agile made us forget that some planning is actually quite useful. Most of the time we haven’t even understood the problem before we start coding. I want to show how Architectural Katas can help us train methods like events storming or to focus more on requirements in general.

[Music]

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,800
yeah good morning welcome everybody I'm

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,639
kind of surprised oh my god nothing

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,640
interesting in the other talks yeah

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,380
welcome and because there's so many of

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,490
you our question who of you knows but I

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,930
checked ricotta's arm okay

00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,430
who a feels just tip because they're

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,900
interested in knowing what architecture

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:35,550
cutters are okay I hope you won't be

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:37,950
disappointed very short introduction my

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:39,809
name is Frank I'm freelancing as a coach

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,329
developer console whatever you want to

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,399
call it for three and a half years

00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,039
my main focus is on quote quality and

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,809
this includes architecture because if

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,120
the architectures broken then you can

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,750
have the best coach coding style guide

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,219
and it will still be a mess and any

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,170
texture cutters are actually my favorite

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:01,140
workshop so I love talking about them

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:03,480
and I love preventing them if you have

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,400
any feedback constructive bad whatever

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,810
and also maybe you liked it you can

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,330
follow me on Twitter and leave some

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,680
comments because if you tell me what I

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,360
can do better next time

00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,759
I can improve a few seen with the Moines

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm from Hamburg and I also run the

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,140
piece we use a group in Hamburg so if

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,390
you ein hem work around sometime feel

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:29,640
free to come by and you're always

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,320
welcome so much for introduction I want

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,780
to talk about two things first of all

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,930
there is a problem was our he checks our

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,490
planning and I checked us in general and

00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:41,250
then I will talk about if I check

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:44,880
Jakarta's can maybe help solving or at

00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:47,729
least delegating the problem normally

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,140
and that may be disclaimer upfront at

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,880
conferences when people talk about

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,340
architecture it's about design patterns

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,810
about technical stuff I will not talk

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,110
about technical stuff I will not talk

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,549
about design patterns and it's always

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,350
interesting when I do the workshop by

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,960
the company where people don't know what

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,820
to expect they come with a laptop and

00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,710
sit in the room and expect that will do

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,780
hard coding and everything and then we

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,780
have a 2-day workshop without a laptop

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,709
at all so this is not about technical

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,469
stuff

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:18,840
it's more about how to how do you get

00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:26,250
from requirements to the technical stuff

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:29,010
a lot the problem it was Gary I can hear

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,530
myself up kind of creepy what a software

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,819
architecture normally I would ask the

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:35,189
question to the people I'll do the Roger

00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,129
birth and Martin Fowler has a really

00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:40,950
nice description or definition of

00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:42,450
software architecture because software

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,629
I'll check sure those decisions that I

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:47,819
have to change these are the decisions

00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:51,030
we take in the beginning when we start

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,819
planning our new software these are the

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:57,180
fundamental decisions we will have later

00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,700
on if these are based on wrong

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,409
information or missing information we

00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,109
will have a hard time changing them

00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:05,790
later you've probably all of worked with

00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:08,519
legacy code where you say okay dammit

00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,650
this is completely not what I would do

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:11,819
it if I would do it again because now I

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,469
have more information I would do

00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,530
differently and I know what to expect

00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:19,530
but the beginning you take assumptions

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:22,169
you start coding and then you make

00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:25,079
decisions that turn out later that are

00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:27,329
wrong place wrong information or missing

00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:29,010
information and these are very hard to

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:35,310
change because everything else is based

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:37,319
on these first decisions unless you read

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,280
this because probably most of you know

00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,280
at least the situation

00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:07,469
it's easy to find out when people are

00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,939
finished because people's like laughing

00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:15,400
who appears workers customers like that

00:04:09,939 --> 00:04:16,810
more or less I mean they most of the

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,470
time they don't really know what they

00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:22,000
want later on as well they just assume

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,400
that you can help them getting there

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,090
somehow and you can help them figuring

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,919
out what they really want so yeah we are

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,199
stuck we have to sign a software for

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,599
problem their customer don't even know

00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,820
what the real problem is and then we

00:04:34,599 --> 00:04:38,380
want to have a good architecture and a

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,150
good Quattro could code a good code

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,280
quality for the software where we don't

00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:47,860
know the problem for kind of complicated

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,139
so my favorite saying and my sadly

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:53,440
typical experience is weeks of coding

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,000
can save you hours of planning I've been

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,759
in so many teams and so many companies

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,639
where people say okay

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,080
we don't have time we have a deadline we

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,789
have so much pressure we need to get

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,500
working on it because the customers

00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:07,960
waiting for that we cannot wait we

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,159
cannot waste time and planning and think

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,050
about other stuff we have to start

00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,280
somewhere because we also have a huge

00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:14,919
team in the background

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:18,280
Sigyn are sitting around and waiting to

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:21,310
do something so can we just start coding

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,930
I mean let's start and let's start

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:26,289
somewhere and then we go ahead and we'll

00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:29,409
figure out the rest while we do that my

00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:31,320
experience and my belief is if you spend

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:33,340
a little bit more time in the beginning

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,030
thinking about the problem and trying to

00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,889
figure out the problem

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,800
it will save you along a lot of time

00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,360
later on who a few has been in a

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,520
situation where you coded something and

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,320
maybe two months later you've been there

00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,849
oh damn it if I would have known that in

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,000
the first place I would have done

00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:54,700
differently yeah

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,990
ooh a few we'll do it again after that

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:58,250
now there are some yeah but in most

00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,960
situation you can do it you've raised

00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,150
two months you've created something

00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,090
there is something there and you start

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,310
yeah rocking around with that and trying

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,380
to figure out how you can use the stuff

00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,440
you created already to solve the problem

00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,930
you know discovered if you would have

00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,460
spent some time in the beginning trying

00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:18,590
to figure out the problem getting the

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,600
information in first then it would have

00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,600
been probably better and we get to that

00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:30,170
all of you is working a job more or less

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:35,840
whoever you know sale HR manifesto

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:38,360
oh okay that's good so I mean HL we are

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,950
planning what what is he talking about I

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,720
don't read under the plan responding to

00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,090
change over following a plan we want to

00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,410
work to be flexible right so we don't

00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,160
want to spend time planning that is

00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,680
waterfall

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,880
isn't it like wasting time in the

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,890
beginning to figure out what you want to

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:56,720
do that's the stuff we left behind

00:06:53,890 --> 00:07:00,530
whoever knows the 12 principles behind

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,600
the age of manifesto there's the second

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:04,550
page to the AJ manifesto and this is

00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,790
actually maybe more important first page

00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,580
and they have 12 principles that are

00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:12,230
behind these things and responding to

00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,540
change over following a plan doesn't

00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,950
mean you shouldn't have a plan it

00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,740
doesn't mean responding to change and

00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,750
forget the plan it just fast whereas

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,490
responding to changes is more important

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,680
than having a plan or falling or

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,890
sticking to the plan but we should have

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,740
maybe a little bit and also if you're

00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:33,800
really a jar these are two of the 12

00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,480
principles behind that business people

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,580
and developers must work together daily

00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:41,810
throughout the project who a few is

00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:44,810
doing better daily was a customer okay

00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,730
before now we have like 5% before we

00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,100
read like 90% to saying they're working

00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,940
working a job the most efficient

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,100
effective method of conveying

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,020
information to and within a development

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,460
team is face-to-face conversation so we

00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,470
want a face-to-face conversation with

00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,860
our customer daily who are feeling

00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:59,860
better

00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:05,269
but if you're not doing this because

00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:06,829
this is really the idea how you can

00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:10,579
respond to change because the customer

00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:12,739
the business partner is noticing seeing

00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:16,759
and discussing every change every day

00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:17,899
with you so then you can be flexible if

00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,489
you cannot do this and there are a lot

00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:22,609
of reasons why you cannot do this maybe

00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:24,259
the customer is remote they they hired

00:08:22,609 --> 00:08:27,829
you to do their stuff because they don't

00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:29,899
want to be bothered robots in the first

00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:32,209
place so maybe in a different department

00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:34,149
they have all the other stuff to do as

00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:37,189
well it's not your job to sit there

00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:40,459
helping developers so there are very

00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:42,110
valid reasons why this won't happen but

00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:45,199
if you don't do this you have a hard

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:47,360
time having a constant change a constant

00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,649
discussion about what's going on so if

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:54,949
you can't do this you should at least

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:56,480
plan a little bit okay so if HR is not

00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:59,300
real solution and we're having a hard

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,899
time being really HR we probably new

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:06,610
plan and we still have problem for that

00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:10,040
maybe more experienced woodworking

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:14,899
Frederick Brooks not Union anymore who

00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,300
knows the name okay your first row for a

00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,529
reason he wrote another very famous book

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,839
mythical man-month

00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:22,730
who have heard of that maybe a couple

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,970
more read it everybody go ahead learn it

00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:29,569
from 1975 I worked for it later again

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:34,009
it's a 1975 read it it's perfect it's

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:35,569
really good and in 2010 he wrote a new

00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:38,240
book I have to cover in the slides as

00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:40,220
well sadly only a German version in

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,160
English design of design in German it's

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,649
a fortress design he's not only talking

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,019
about soft paradigm but also about

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:51,050
building a house and stuff like that

00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:53,779
and in the book he's asking how do we

00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:56,809
get great designers he's talking about

00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,579
how to have you get to great design but

00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:00,559
she's covered ok great is Dinah's design

00:09:58,579 --> 00:10:03,139
they have a lot of experience doing

00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,610
design and making a lot of mistakes and

00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,559
getting better and better and better so

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,279
they know how to think out of the box

00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,809
and how to come up with great solutions

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,980
like the first iPhone like only having

00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:14,960
one button

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,910
from design perspective of a great idea

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,440
and nobody else was thinking about that

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,530
all other phones before that were adding

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:25,460
more buttons to add more stuff instead

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:28,910
of removing more buttons okay more

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:32,630
experience that nice and I mean okay

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,820
there's the book and the greatest

00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:39,320
teacher has failure

00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:41,240
now failure is sorry and I believed it

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,620
as well I mean those people who have

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,660
more experience and I really good at

00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,180
something failed a lot of times to know

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:54,920
what to avoid what to do and how to get

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:59,120
better sounds simple as that the book

00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,550
came out in 2010 in 2012 tech Newark was

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,960
at I'm not sure if also Jax or some

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,430
other conference I think about the

00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,870
conference and yes he thought okay if

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,640
great designers get better if they

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,390
design more what about software

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:16,070
architects how is supposed to get great

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:17,780
architects if they only get a chance to

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,470
I take fewer than a half thousand times

00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,510
in their career

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,730
he's talking about big details not like

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:24,400
smaller designs but really big designs

00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:26,810
where the project will last a couple of

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,650
many years or something in development

00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:31,790
time and my experience as well if you

00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,230
have young develop prostate

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,810
are not really involved in the high tech

00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:38,030
chure process then maybe once I get to

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:40,070
senior level they start doing a textured

00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,830
stuff they do it a couple of times and

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,510
make a couple of mistakes and once I get

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:46,520
better they may be promoted to team lead

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,550
CTO or whatever and they don't do it

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,170
anymore so as soon as I get area better

00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:54,200
at that job they are not doing it

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,480
anymore and do we really want to fail at

00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,360
that point I mean these are all custom

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,010
customer projects you don't want to put

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,080
our senior developers into a situation

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:05,860
where we have a customer is waiting for

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:09,260
project and please learn was failing I

00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:11,260
don't think the customer will be happy

00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,000
about that

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:17,000
so Taniya came up with the idea okay can

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,760
we their way to maybe train that get

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,780
into a situation that we have people the

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,730
people in the situation where they can

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,520
train and fail was all the risk that we

00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,550
lose a customer

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:30,690
the idea of an electric

00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:33,630
was born who a few have heard about coat

00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,130
cutters okay a bit more for those who

00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,220
don't know that I will give a small

00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,240
explanation would cut us in a minute

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,890
because now we're talking about a

00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,420
high-tech chest cut a check chocolate

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,040
and how they can solve this problem like

00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,220
we don't have enough experience and we

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,110
are not really yeah our experience of

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,110
planning and getting to a solution to an

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,640
architectural solution as we leave yeah

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,829
we don't have so much experience that

00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:01,140
most of the people what is the cutter

00:12:55,829 --> 00:13:04,140
the idea comes from a martial art from

00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,850
karate if an exercise will repeat a form

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,480
many many times making little and

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:13,470
proofing and each probably the most

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,899
famous code kata is fist bus it's a very

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,850
bad example because it's used for all of

00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,790
what's useful for hiring stuff and

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,220
interviewing people it's like you count

00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:25,800
from 1 to 100 and every number you can

00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,480
divide by 3 you print out fist every

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,220
number you divide so you can divide by 5

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,670
your finger to us and if you can divide

00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:34,079
it by 3 and 5 you print out fist pass

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,700
that the website was more than 100

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,670
solutions for any language you can think

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,800
of so there are a lot of solutions for

00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,990
this simple problem and people use this

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,959
in an interview process to figure out if

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:49,350
people can at least start programming

00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:50,520
right away or if they are just already

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,190
having problem with a simple problem

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:55,410
like this and a la very famous code

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:57,390
cutter as a bowling game we just program

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:59,730
a software waiver into the pins you bolt

00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,850
and then the software will calculate how

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:06,510
many points to get code cutters are very

00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:08,700
very simple problems which you can solve

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:12,270
in like 20 minutes half an hour one hour

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:15,089
and iterate with new solutions new ideas

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:17,339
and maybe come up with new solutions and

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:19,320
trying to learn from that all the time

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:20,579
maybe sometime you're using dependency

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,459
injection the next times you are

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,529
avoiding dependency injection just to

00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,440
see what will that make to your code how

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:29,899
the code will change what the term what

00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,300
the code will look like if you do this

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,990
and a high tech Jakarta is taking this

00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,390
to another level

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,370
not about smaller still small problems

00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,019
small scale problems but not on the

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,429
coding Vegas but on like

00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:47,269
planning the architecture face and while

00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:51,059
code cut a steak like intercepts between

00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:53,129
22 minutes to or 1 hour and you check

00:14:51,059 --> 00:15:02,670
check let us take most of time at least

00:14:53,129 --> 00:15:04,319
1 hour maybe 2 hours but not more the

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:05,759
basic idea is they are manageable and

00:15:04,319 --> 00:15:09,329
science and duration so you're not

00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,249
wasting like weeks of planning and doing

00:15:09,329 --> 00:15:13,139
stuff but really only a short time you

00:15:11,249 --> 00:15:15,179
don't need to come up with a perfect

00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,559
solution the whole idea is what about

00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,449
getting a perfect solution the whole

00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:21,019
idea is were trading the process getting

00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:25,110
better getting new ideas how to do that

00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:28,079
and make mistakes to fail to learn from

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:31,439
this failing in a safe environment where

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,089
no customer will be unhappy or angry if

00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:38,790
you fail the product or come up with a

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:40,170
non perfect solution on the other way I

00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,079
want you maybe want to come up with a

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:44,790
non perfect solution to see ok how will

00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,619
the architecture look like if I try

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,779
something that I will never do in a real

00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:51,119
life environment because then you can

00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:53,999
learn from that and you would never want

00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:55,529
to do that was a real customer and a

00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:57,059
very important point is to do this with

00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,519
both of our groups and you get feedback

00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:01,589
from each group so you have feedback

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,959
from your peers from other people who

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:07,079
can give their learnings and tell you

00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,269
what they can improve and the chemical

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,579
house because you're running in a

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:14,579
situation where you must be prepared to

00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:17,279
pay it and I said before it's not about

00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:19,309
finding a great solution getting coming

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,079
up with a great architecture but

00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:24,749
iterating failing learning how to get

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,269
better in this process so you can get

00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:33,059
better when it really comes up in a real

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:36,720
environment in a real project the idea

00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:38,100
from check Nuits itself there are two

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,799
scenarios the first one is what

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,239
certainly explains on his website and

00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,639
how he came up the other one is from my

00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,339
experience but also have like three to

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,649
five people in a group my perfect size

00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,899
of a group of three people because then

00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,360
you have a lot of discussions but for

00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:55,519
people it's still okay it was

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,290
- in a group view very often left at

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,860
least one person who is not involved in

00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,870
session maybe sit in a chair and it's

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,699
tired and looked at this mobile phone

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:09,170
and isn't paying attention so it's very

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:10,910
very often happens that people are not

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,640
been involved with five people group

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:15,920
three people you have a hard time trying

00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,420
to get not involved because you only

00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,250
have three people you are always

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,270
involved he said four to ten groups you

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,920
can do this if you have like a

00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,589
conference set up where you want to do a

00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:31,130
workshop with a lot of groups and split

00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:32,330
them up of our whole a big room and just

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,260
let them figure out stuff

00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,460
I prefer our maximum of three groups

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,200
because we get to the rules later I will

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,640
be the facilitator I will answering

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,549
questions for all these groups and

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,410
typically I want to teach them specific

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,620
things with each each cutter maybe

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:51,919
trying to figure out requirements maybe

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,390
trying to get more technical but I will

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,130
be the bottleneck because they will ask

00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:57,049
me questions if I have more than three

00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:59,330
groups but somewhere five groups and I

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:01,160
need ten minutes for each group the last

00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:03,620
group is waiting 40 minutes to me for me

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:07,070
to arrive there so more groups means I

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,080
will be a huge bottleneck I would do the

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,549
first one for user groups or for

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,530
surrounds like this but we just want to

00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:14,960
introduce the idea and have a lot of fun

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:16,669
if I want to have to affect a tool like

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,040
today training at a customer and they

00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:21,440
want to train this in more detail I will

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,730
say three people three groups is a

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,220
perfect size the other difference is

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,230
that if you're in a bigger room of motor

00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,450
groups you can have different cutters

00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,130
different project for each group so when

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:38,150
the later and compare their idea of the

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:39,950
solutions its new for every group with

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,419
the smaller size like three groups I

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,240
will use the same project the same

00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:45,890
cutter so they can more get more into

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,309
detail and one of the problems the other

00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:50,690
group had so I can they discussing on

00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,910
the same level and don't have to figure

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:56,809
out the whole situation when the group

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:59,360
presents their idea both are fine I

00:18:56,809 --> 00:19:00,830
would choose which way I will do it

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,990
depending on the location depending on

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,309
situation and where I am as I said for

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,890
conferences for big groups for

00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:09,830
introducing this I would use

00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:12,530
as much groups as possible to introduce

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:14,299
to more people if I do it as a customer

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:16,670
I would say okay make it a smaller group

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:20,179
so people can get more out of it and I

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:25,190
have more time to talk to people how

00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:26,840
does it work very very simple I will

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,950
give you a real example of a high-tech

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,870
jacket in a minute

00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:31,429
so I just want to make you sure you

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:32,840
understand how the process works you

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:34,549
have an introduction like I will

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,920
introduce the injector cutter will

00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:41,750
present it to everyone ask if they have

00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:44,540
any problems understanding the idea

00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,280
behind that not talking about problems

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,260
in the project itself and the cutter but

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,620
general to have any understanding

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,260
problems is it clear for everybody then

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,520
we have the planning phase as a one hour

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,160
to two hours for the team's

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,710
weather can really get whiteboards use

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,460
whatever I want I prefer white but for a

00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:07,490
reason and they can just plan and try to

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,740
get from these small cutter which is

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,950
just written texts to an architecture

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,870
vision then we have the presentation

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:16,610
where each group presents their solution

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:18,530
the idea is to come up with an ie tech

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,830
chure vision not the real solution I

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,840
don't have to prove program anything in

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,780
a lot of time a lot of times a lot of

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,470
cases really hard to even come up with a

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,809
vision within two hours I've seen teams

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:34,760
failing left like two hours and they

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:36,559
don't even get the requirements clearly

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,690
communicated within two hours because of

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,490
so we're not used to do that and it's

00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,960
really hard if you have unclear

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,030
requirements and you have to figure out

00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,890
the requirements and come up with an

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:47,900
architecture solution if you have never

00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:51,080
done that or not that often it's really

00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:53,840
hard and then you get feedback from all

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,370
the other people the other groups I get

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,080
feedback as well obviously as a trainer

00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,960
but the main ideas that they give

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,370
feedback to each other and figure out

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,410
talking to each other what one girl how

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:07,460
can I improve and later on I will give

00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:11,480
more ideas how they can improve the

00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:16,010
rules look like a lot isn't really much

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:18,050
I will go through them very fast you can

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,770
ask me as instructor faciliate any

00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,309
question you want

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,990
I

00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:24,679
have to come up with solutions with

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,950
answers like I said I will be mall as

00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,659
everybody the team that the team was

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,730
doing the ricotta is not like if they

00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:33,769
had the development team I will be the

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:36,049
customer I believe the project manager I

00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:38,960
will be the next department of the next

00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,730
door anybody they can think of other

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,710
questions for I will be the one who has

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,440
to answer the question which can be

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:47,840
quite fun because I can kind of steer

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,220
how hard I want to make it for them but

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,870
sometimes they come up with questions I

00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:54,590
never thought about and then I have to

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:56,749
make something up on the spot they must

00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,629
be prepared to present their idea later

00:21:56,749 --> 00:22:00,889
on and defend the questions a few tough

00:21:59,629 --> 00:22:02,659
question about that I must defend that

00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:05,149
it's very small but therefore very

00:22:02,659 --> 00:22:06,710
important part of this and they must be

00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:10,009
prepared to ask questions to the other

00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,570
teams so don't just sit there and wait

00:22:10,009 --> 00:22:14,480
for their team to present the idea and

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,950
say yeah looks nice but really trying to

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,990
run you want to get better so you have

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:21,860
to try to figure out what can be

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:24,249
improved you can make safely assumption

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,809
about technologies you don't know well

00:22:24,249 --> 00:22:29,059
this means if you don't know if this

00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:32,240
technology can really do this little

00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:36,980
salsas problem as long as it's ok and

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,200
you can define it you can do this the

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,480
funny part is these technical stuff are

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,210
not really used a lot because it's not

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,100
about technical solutions it's more

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,169
about figuring out what the problem is

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,320
and then the dead technical solution

00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,700
should just stick to the problem you may

00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,499
not assume you have hiring and firing

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,919
authorities something I haven't really

00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:59,629
had problems with in my workshop so far

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,190
but it's interesting because some people

00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,110
may say okay if we just hire 20

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:05,869
developers and then we can do this

00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:07,639
easily and we hire the best people for

00:23:05,869 --> 00:23:10,820
NGO or whatever and then they can do all

00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:13,129
the stuff we think of especially when I

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,840
introduce like deadlines and say ok your

00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:16,249
project let's either has a deadline in

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,610
two months or come up with a solution

00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:21,830
you can yeah you can create in two month

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:24,649
so I can introduce limits and then they

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:25,789
come up our work we just hire another 20

00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:28,220
developers and then we can do this

00:23:25,789 --> 00:23:29,690
easily and no you have to come up with

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,190
solution that if it's in a time frame

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,840
and within your normal team

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:38,290
any technology is fair game you must

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,160
justify it again my experience is when

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:44,610
people start talking about technology

00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:47,080
during these cut outs very early on

00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:49,090
there's a problem because they are

00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,290
already talking about which technology

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:54,059
they want to use but they still don't

00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:56,380
understand the problem so they are

00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:57,970
relatively less decided on technology

00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,559
and now they just have to fit the

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,200
problem into the technology and not the

00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:04,210
other way around

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,730
and if anybody has any other questions

00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:10,809
about rules they can always ask about

00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:13,120
that said all these hiring and tolerant

00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:15,429
technology stuff is usually not really

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,460
used at all the main important things

00:24:15,429 --> 00:24:20,710
are the presentation asking question the

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,190
presentations and asking me anything you

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,330
want

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:28,900
during the workshop okay now we'll see

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:30,220
how a cutter looks like this is one of

00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:36,600
our favorite cutters because it's very

00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:36,600
simple and this is all the teams get I

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:45,690
will read it or I think you are reading

00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,690
us so I will just waiting for a moment

00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,910
this is like this example is taken from

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,790
the website from tech Newark yes like a

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:22,810
randomized I should take Jakarta

00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:26,470
generator you can press a button and you

00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,820
can a randomized random tech Shikata

00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,740
which is quite interesting if you're

00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,020
just doing this in your team and do it a

00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:33,820
couple of times some of them are really

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:38,200
tough some of them I haven't even tried

00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,580
yet because I had I myself don't have

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,850
any idea how to solve them

00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:46,120
they're very complex this looks very

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:49,290
very easy there are a couple of things

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:52,600
in there I would kind of spoil for you

00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:55,120
that make this very nice as a starting

00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,770
cutter first of all you might notice

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,720
that users unsure whatever the local

00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,930
music community is there's a lot of

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,670
stuff that's not really well defined

00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:06,490
this helps me as an facilitator I can

00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:09,250
use this to change the scope of the

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,140
whole cutter to make it bigger to make

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,950
it smaller to make it harder to make it

00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:19,840
easier but in general the sounds really

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:21,460
simple I mean they want more they want

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,310
to connect to their audience they want

00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,630
to have a wish list coming up what

00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,580
exactly is wanted here that's a wish

00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:31,540
list there's okay what is the voting

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:33,730
system but the wish lists do people need

00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,230
to log in to add a wish

00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,420
what about officials in general can they

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:38,650
add free text is there a database behind

00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,750
that

00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:43,510
what kind of connection might we have on

00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,040
need to the radio station there's a lot

00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:47,290
of stuff hidden here that people need to

00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,030
figure out by themselves because two

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,250
people the customer will just tell them

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,090
we want this and they have no clue what

00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:54,190
I can

00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:57,580
I think meanwhile I can pray Freddy

00:26:54,190 --> 00:27:00,490
dumped the customer pretty good so I can

00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:01,810
just whenever kind of developers ask me

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,280
do you want this do you need this I

00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:05,830
would say oh yes it sounds cool I want

00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,840
that if they if they come up with the

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,910
stuff they want to tell me and ask me if

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,290
I need that I will always say yes if you

00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,670
if you come up with a good solution and

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,550
ask me to do one thing the ants I want

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:18,370
that the same cost same time and of

00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:22,600
course as you promote this shouldn't be

00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:25,030
any effort right so this is quite easy

00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,370
the other scenarios I really like

00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:30,310
because they really focus on

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,660
if you ask the wrong questions customers

00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:34,150
will always say yes and they are really

00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:36,970
happy that you tell them whatever what

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,010
else you can do what sounds good but I

00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:42,930
try to teach the developers all the time

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:45,430
as if you need to come up with some

00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,350
decision and very often we have to we

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:48,940
have to decide which where we go do we

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,170
invest more into the architecture do we

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,090
make a simple architecture

00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:55,270
these all have consequences on the

00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,160
business side because maybe the

00:27:55,270 --> 00:28:00,100
developer the customer later on wants to

00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,570
add more to this whole website to the

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,300
whole application maybe here some some

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:06,400
ideas and beg of his head or in the in

00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,990
his desk and she's thinking if this

00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,780
works up well we can maybe add more

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,830
stuff to it later maybe he won't tell

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,230
you because he don't think it's

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:15,790
important for you but if you ask him are

00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,040
you planning to add more stuff to this

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,500
later and you maybe can create an

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,360
architecture that will not do this yet

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,910
but it's prepared to do this later on if

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,710
you don't ask him and you think yeah you

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,690
will not do this because it's not in

00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:30,160
their clearance you may build an

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:31,750
architecture that will have a huge

00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,400
problem as soon as the customer says oh

00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:36,130
this block of well now we want to act

00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,290
like a new feature for customers and you

00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:40,690
say okay that was never plan or I cannot

00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:41,920
do this this is where the decisions at

00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:46,240
beginning can really have a huge impact

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,070
in the funny palace because I know this

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,950
cutter very well I had know exactly what

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:54,130
questions I expect what questions they

00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,260
should ask and how I can play with them

00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:59,410
I said don't ask the questions because

00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,610
then I can have fun because then I can

00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,950
later on when they present that you can

00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:06,750
also wait did you ask the customer about

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:06,750
that because that's not what he wanted

00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:11,020
in our job as developers or architecture

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,320
we often have to come up with decisions

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:17,440
and what I want that the developers do

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,120
is prevent a business owner of the

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,810
customer the project manager and other

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,210
department

00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:27,610
prevent them with ideas and what's

00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:29,920
behind that like we have two options and

00:29:27,610 --> 00:29:32,290
you must tell them what the consequences

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:35,050
are we can do it this way and this means

00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,250
we would probably create a faster any

00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,860
tech chure we don't waste a lot of time

00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,400
on anything like user rated stuff or

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,320
user login system

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,910
this means they cannot work in we cannot

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,370
really track we might have multiple

00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,110
voting as another thing that's hidden in

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,780
here what about multiple voting for the

00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,010
same song or same playlist

00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:53,240
or do you want to have a solution where

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,650
people need to log in that means there

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,120
might be those customers takes a lot

00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:59,390
more time because we have to create an

00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,730
user interface GDP is a problem we need

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:04,820
to take care of in that situation but it

00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:07,640
will enable other stuff it's not our

00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,490
responsibility and even at our job to

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,340
take this decision because it's a

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:16,130
business driven decision but when we ask

00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,900
business partners customers forever do

00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:19,760
one of this way or that way we have to

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,430
also tell the consequences and the cost

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,130
of that because if you just ask them do

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:28,430
you want this or that they have on what

00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,810
paste should pay the herbicide they

00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:31,790
don't know the technique on defense they

00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:33,740
don't know maybe as more effort it'll

00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:36,440
take does it take longer than heather

00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:39,170
any risk involved because you just asked

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,000
them for decision you are afraid and you

00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,650
cannot take for yourself something you

00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,990
also have to give them the idea what's

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,310
behind that and this is something you

00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,080
can train very good with this cutter

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,660
because I can pay the customer and yes

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,700
I'm also a developer I know what's

00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:55,970
behind that and when they come up with

00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:58,070
some asking stupid about stupid ideas I

00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,510
as a customer can say okay I will take

00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,180
that and I've developed I will tell them

00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:03,740
yeah I will take them and I will keep

00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,860
your eye hats with bets because I know

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,630
what you're trying to do like if you

00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,430
come up with tariffs if they have to

00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,870
tell me if if they want to tell me like

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:14,330
okay or if you don't want to have

00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,920
multiple voting's oh okay if you want to

00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:19,490
don't one of motive outings this will

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,230
take another two weeks to implement as a

00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:23,240
customer there's no idea about technical

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:24,200
stuff they can try to tell me that as a

00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,110
developer I know they're talking

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,910
 because I know their solutions

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:31,460
that are much better than they they take

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:35,180
like a couple of hours they are not

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,170
perfect the multiple voting web stuff of

00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,210
course you can do is something like

00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:40,520
people have to login to vote and you can

00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:42,500
invite more to voting's as long as they

00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:44,000
don't use multiple accounts you also

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,530
lose a lot of customers because not

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,850
everybody wants to log in to vote on a

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:52,700
song but what about maybe yeah it's just

00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:53,820
checking for IP addresses if you have to

00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,679
store them

00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,350
you have to check okay what are we doing

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,090
is gdpr cookie is saying we have to have

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,210
a cookie warning but these might also

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:05,009
just disable the multi-year voting stuff

00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,109
but then you have to also disable the

00:32:05,009 --> 00:32:08,970
voting because of the the river cookies

00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:10,080
because there's a voting us for each

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,700
song as being played

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,909
that means the next song should be being

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,559
voted again the user should be able to

00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:19,979
vote on the next song again so the

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,299
cookie needs to be disabled then you

00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,070
have to Kenya 5 discussion with the

00:32:21,299 --> 00:32:26,220
customer if it's really worth all this

00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,779
effort all the solutions to justice able

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:31,409
this or if you maybe just want to start

00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,879
without having this disabled you need to

00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:34,409
have make clear all the contact fences

00:32:32,879 --> 00:32:35,849
all the costs of these decisions you

00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:37,859
cannot just ask do you want to disable

00:32:35,849 --> 00:32:39,059
this or don't you don't you want to say

00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:41,489
but do you want cookies or don't you

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,409
want to cookies talk about the

00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:46,279
consequences the costs and the ideas

00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:49,349
behind that because then he can make

00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:53,929
well decided and well informed business

00:32:49,349 --> 00:32:53,929
decision because that's his job not ours

00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:59,789
there are I think about twenty to thirty

00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,979
catch us on this website you can come up

00:32:59,789 --> 00:33:04,820
with your own cut-offs very easily for

00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:07,289
taking examples from your daily life

00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,479
some of them are very technical I've

00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:11,369
seen people doing this cutter within one

00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:13,619
hour and after one hour they were

00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:15,899
talking about the database table

00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:16,979
structure they were finished more or

00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,539
less these were very experienced people

00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:21,090
one of them was an ex colleague of mine

00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:23,789
who was lead for the quality Department

00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:25,019
another one was in CTO they have done

00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:27,419
there's a lot of times in the career

00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:29,580
they were really flying through this and

00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:33,389
doing this easily I've seen other people

00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:36,690
after one hour they were still not sure

00:33:33,389 --> 00:33:38,190
about what they want to do because when

00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:41,039
you're not used to do this looks like

00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:44,460
this like a story we get it's a little

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,059
bit more or less structure than if you

00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,739
get a real customer requirement but

00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:51,749
typically we get a customer maybe we get

00:33:49,739 --> 00:33:54,059
a user story from a customer and then we

00:33:51,749 --> 00:34:00,179
figure out how can we translate this

00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:01,799
text to an architecture to code maybe

00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:03,299
most of you know this big picture where

00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,980
you have some planning there and that's

00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:06,030
a big bubble in the middle and the magic

00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,379
happens here

00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:11,500
like this transformation from text to

00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:14,050
code this is something okay how do we do

00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,429
this how do we get from text from non

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,340
complete requirements to code for

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:20,619
architecture and this is a hard part and

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,540
said in the beginning most architecture

00:34:20,619 --> 00:34:25,119
talks talk about design patterns and how

00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:28,149
I take care of items we have secured s

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,860
and we C and so on this is a technical

00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,570
part this is kind of easy we can claim

00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,490
that there are a lot of documentation

00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:37,570
about that but how do we get from here

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:39,250
to a secure s architecture can we even

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:40,360
be sure of secrets for example is the

00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:43,690
right architecture for this we don't

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,490
know how can we figure this out and this

00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:48,490
is what an eye socket a road trip for me

00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:52,450
is all about learning this process how

00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:55,540
do I get from incomplete kind of yeah

00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:57,730
not so clearly defined requirements to

00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:59,740
an architecture and that can be trained

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:01,570
the funny part is if I do this I will

00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:04,660
show some pictures later produced as a

00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:07,270
2-day workshop that means typically for

00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:09,010
cutters - for each day in the beginning

00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,510
the first time they use white pots

00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:13,510
because wipeouts are easy to wipe away

00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,970
some stuff they write they write a lot

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,270
of text I try to defer rewrite the

00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:21,520
requirements and Prada in text again and

00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,990
this very hard because text lists not so

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,710
clearly find a lot of times and you just

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:28,780
want to rewrite it and they have a hard

00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:30,130
time it was just this example to even

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,200
get to the point where a few other

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:36,130
clients then you introduce some more

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,900
stuff like diagrams are very useful I

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,540
was showing an example for other diagram

00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,730
later on like you melih

00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,890
use case diagrams very very simple and I

00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:47,260
really don't care about UML syntax if

00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:48,700
the error is correct if it filled out if

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:51,630
it's grayed out it whatever I don't care

00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:54,070
but as a communication tool to

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,780
communicate ideas and to write down

00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:58,090
requirements every use case I can use

00:35:55,780 --> 00:36:01,570
this and write down use cases just like

00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:04,140
the stickyman I can just start writing

00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:06,940
and painting them down immediately I

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:10,060
have what user side we have I have a DJ

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:12,580
I have audience and maybe that's it

00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:13,859
but all my user users I have for this so

00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,570
far then I have a couple of use cases

00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:18,580
they want to vote they want to request

00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:19,690
songs they want to vote on those songs

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:23,740
playing right now they want

00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:26,380
the digits they are daily painless these

00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,760
are the use case I can see clearly just

00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,589
in the beginning then I can figure out

00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,650
okay to ask some more use case any use

00:36:29,589 --> 00:36:35,619
cases that are more in between the lines

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:38,589
but if I use this instead of trying to

00:36:35,619 --> 00:36:40,210
write down this as an other text it's

00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:42,910
much fun easier to concentrate and move

00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,230
forward and then also if I have this use

00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,670
case is written down as some maybe your

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:47,589
L diagram I can also figure out okay

00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,180
these are my api's because these are all

00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:52,240
my requests i need later on my system

00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:54,550
they need to be a way that's the

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,069
economic response they need to be an api

00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,160
for voting on the song that's been

00:36:57,069 --> 00:37:01,089
played and voting on the playlist

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,500
obviously they didn't need to be a way

00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:04,450
to show the playlist and everything as

00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,240
well these other things that are kind of

00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,740
hidden in there but they are obvious so

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,300
you can train the way and how can I

00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,310
easily get from the information how can

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:13,900
I transform them into a diagram and how

00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,220
can they use these diagrams to transform

00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:16,930
this into an API and maybe an

00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,180
architecture I think about maybe problem

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:23,200
probably evil but multiple domains later

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,670
on this is very easy example where you

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:29,890
can get but you don't need to get if you

00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:31,329
like the main Rosen stuff then awesome

00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,339
other important thing I talked about

00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:36,040
this book mr. Goodman monster in the

00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:39,460
beginning and there's one chapter

00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,940
planters throw one away and I said the

00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:45,420
book is from 1975 it's very very old and

00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:47,920
he has created like the IBM 360

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,180
operating system he was four there he

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,250
was one of the leading architects for

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,790
that is that the first version

00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:56,589
everything we create a plane to

00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,180
throw all the way because you will know

00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:02,020
better I'll hold you will know how to do

00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:03,430
better after you've done it let's wear

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,319
rapid prototyping everything comes in

00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,760
and who a wolf you has been in a project

00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:08,050
West yeah we just need to create the

00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,869
first version after to a throwed away

00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:14,950
and do it again

00:38:09,869 --> 00:38:17,140
who did that good for those who did it

00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:18,730
but most of the time because it they are

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,710
and it's running and it's working so why

00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,210
entropies brought away it's nearly

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:24,810
perfect we just need to add a cup of new

00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:27,310
feature for that shouldn't be too hard

00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:31,660
so that plan to throw one away it's a

00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:33,590
nice idea and it should work and it will

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:35,900
always be better if you do it again

00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:38,720
but for me the most important part that

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,000
I structures can teach you I don't

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:43,040
I want the teams where Iraq will not to

00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,520
throw the first version away but the

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,110
first three or four versions because

00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,490
every version they get out that it's

00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:53,470
much better than the first version would

00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:57,310
have been but if they do it on white pot

00:38:53,470 --> 00:39:01,310
it very cost free man are free but

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:03,050
cost-efficient because if I can't plan

00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,160
the first three version of white pot and

00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,360
figure out what is wrong with these

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,770
versions right then away and start again

00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:13,100
that cost me a couple of hours maybe

00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,900
days but much much faster than

00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:16,430
implementing and then figuring out that

00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:19,840
you should show or throw it away and

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:22,160
start again that's why I lost white pots

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,810
and a white pot you can wipe stuff away

00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,160
if you figure out this part of the

00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:28,550
architecture that's not good I wipe it

00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:30,140
away and try again I've done the

00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:32,120
structure of a couple of times even for

00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:33,880
the IBC Munich last year and I'm okay we

00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,890
don't have wipers can be useful if chops

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,650
if you ever try to correct something on

00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,270
a flip chart you've written the whole

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:42,500
flips and then you left some corn off

00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,560
the flip chart that's wrong what do you

00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:47,150
do do you turn over if you won't right

00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,400
away you don't turn off one start again

00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,020
you will try to raise it and try to make

00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,850
errors like do you have workarounds

00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:54,830
that's the same that happened the code

00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:56,450
are they written for two months you

00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,160
won't throw it away he will start with

00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:59,930
workarounds

00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,820
so flips out for me a perfect example

00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:03,950
for what will happen in the code if you

00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:09,830
are not able to raise it easily

00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:11,660
I had workshops where customers said

00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,490
they have you don't have chip shot we do

00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,170
it with stickies and flare we don't have

00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:17,570
white coffee dude first flip charts and

00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:19,220
one thing they figured out in the

00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,600
workshop that is really a bad idea and

00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:21,980
they had like one white butt so one

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,710
group was using a wipeout the others

00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:27,140
were couldn't let gooo I had a lot of

00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,140
fun the other groups were a little bit

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,130
frustrated about the tooling and

00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:33,380
afterwards they ordered a couple of

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,420
flips after I think like a lorry full of

00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,330
flip charts so meat was the best outcome

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:41,210
for welcome ever our job they ordered I

00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:45,859
think three to four flips after our

00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:48,089
developers perfect a wipeout sorry

00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:49,740
because for planning if if I come into

00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,940
companies and go to meeting room for

00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,980
developers and there's no whiteboard

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:54,540
available or maybe there's one

00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:57,240
whiteboard where all the postcards are

00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:59,990
sticked on or something how do they do

00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:04,520
planning how does it plan anything I

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:07,020
know I couldn't I would not be able to

00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,730
so white pots a very important tool for

00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,740
planning because it can wipe stuff away

00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:13,280
doesn't mean the flipchart and sticky

00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,740
notes aren't useful for other things I

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,270
will show a little bit later as well but

00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:21,030
why pots are very important for me for

00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,740
planning because I can stand there draw

00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:27,869
some stuff show talk to other people on

00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:30,060
that have a discussion wipe it away our

00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:31,410
set diagrams can help they ask the one

00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:34,320
diagram method I want to mention at

00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:36,570
least because UML probably everybody

00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,820
knows that one a lot of people hate UML

00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,589
for obvious reasons um Ella has I don't

00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,640
know the current situation sixteen

00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:49,560
fifteen diagram hanging types I don't

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,780
know um they've also huge rent I forget

00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,819
the name damage of the one who invented

00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,290
this model he wrote in a rant about UML

00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:57,240
like you only have to use a couple of

00:41:55,290 --> 00:41:59,310
these diagram types that use case class

00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,130
diagram maybe component diagram activity

00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:05,630
from all the other types you rarely use

00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:08,849
and I agree to that I've learned UML

00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:10,530
maybe twenty years ago and I have a hard

00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:11,910
time remembering anything besides these

00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:15,089
father ever used in a practical

00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:17,069
environment but you skaters are very

00:42:15,089 --> 00:42:19,020
useful class diagrams can be very useful

00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:20,280
and components diagrams depending on the

00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,560
size of the eye texture can be very

00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,109
useful as well a couple of years later

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,990
came up as an idea was c4

00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:29,339
it's the c-4 model of orc all the links

00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:31,710
on the slides later on I'll put them

00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:33,569
online and we can access them via the

00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:36,240
book in from the conference

00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:39,510
the idea behind c4 was like Google Maps

00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,119
you can zoom in this is just a picture

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,040
out of the middle out of the container

00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:46,800
area it was called c4 because he called

00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:48,710
the highest level context the names have

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,210
been changed a little school called c4

00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:53,210
context then containers

00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:59,260
all right let me check no way to compare

00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,420
the containers components and classes

00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,280
and the idea was like you're on the

00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,180
highest level and then you can zoom into

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,829
the next level

00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:08,049
zoom into the next level and zoom into

00:43:05,829 --> 00:43:11,230
the lowest level of a third code as a

00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:13,690
castle I learned this one I was doing

00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:15,640
this workshop for I checked your cutters

00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:17,650
at the circuit test and we are doing

00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,910
this in a room and one guy came in and

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,839
looked at the eye detection cutter and

00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,450
he didn't you actually takes your

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,000
cutters but he oh this was cool let me

00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:27,130
help let me join you and he started

00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,760
drawing these kind of pictures and

00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:32,559
really he draw the main the the highest

00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,740
level which is kind of like a use case

00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,569
but more focused on what context we have

00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:40,569
what kind of applications do we have and

00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:42,369
then zoom in to the next one picked out

00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:44,980
one of them zoomed in and started

00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:46,450
writing there for me this was an

00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,950
eye-opener because a lot of times when

00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:50,020
you have discussions was a developer's

00:43:47,950 --> 00:43:51,940
about architecture you get lost in

00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,010
details you're talking about a lot of

00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:55,539
teachers on the lowest level while

00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,520
figuring out how to plan your

00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:58,920
architecture on the highest level but we

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,240
have to take care of this special case

00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,980
yes we have but not on the highest level

00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:06,970
we need to make sure that we can solve

00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:08,740
it down somewhere but we don't need to

00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:10,119
figure out how to solve it yet when we

00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:12,309
while we try to figure out maybe what

00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:13,480
kind of services we need you know one of

00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:16,420
the servers need to figure out this

00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,369
problem need to solve the problem but

00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:20,020
while we're talking about the services

00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:23,349
we don't need to talk about the special

00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,480
case developers do this all the time a

00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:27,010
lot of times because they trying to wrap

00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:30,250
around all the information they need in

00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:33,010
the head and it's very important this

00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:35,230
type of diagram helped me and the other

00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,609
people a lot to trying to focus on what

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,900
level are we currently are we on the

00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:40,329
contact level are we on the container

00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,650
level are you on the class level so we

00:44:40,329 --> 00:44:43,710
can figure out do we need to talk about

00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:46,329
this problem on this level yes or no

00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:47,710
it's very easy to put a finger okay we

00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:51,160
are on this level we don't need to talk

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:53,020
about this yet it would be worth

00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,059
probably to make a whole talk about just

00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:58,750
this thing because of match either in

00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:01,390
UML and it's very very useful and I said

00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:03,779
see for more talk it has nothing to do

00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:07,200
with a bomb so you'll save for that and

00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,200
it's very useful

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:11,010
this was all like the kind of slides I

00:45:09,870 --> 00:45:12,810
have for a quick introduction I will

00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:15,090
show you some pictures from a real

00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:18,090
workshop I did like two weeks three

00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:19,500
weeks ago and the wooden and the one who

00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,610
invited me is actually doing a talk

00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,390
right now

00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:25,530
as well and yeah I was giving a talk

00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,330
about a different topic last year in

00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:29,250
Munich and he just noticed or heard

00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:31,020
about architecture cutters and they said

00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:35,700
okay that sounds cool you have to come

00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:37,230
over and do a workshop with us and the

00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:38,880
picture is like pretty dark because of

00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,440
our diagram so if you can see that all

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,310
the details that's okay it just gives

00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,140
you an impression they get to sign up

00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:48,360
right but because the hotel where we

00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,590
didn't have any real whiteboard so it

00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,330
was can limited and they were only

00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:54,420
one-sided on the other side was like we

00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:57,570
could put needles in and it was very

00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:59,340
easy to figure out the cave like this to

00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:02,760
a half's of whiteboard and not even in

00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:05,460
the length but only very high is the

00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,440
bare minimum you need for planning they

00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,180
wiped away during one session or during

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,500
one kata the white parts a couple of

00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,780
times because they were running out of

00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,480
space the best situation is if you have

00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,100
two large whiteboards double-sided that

00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:18,570
will be enough for one cutter because

00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,660
you need lost base and writing stuff

00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:23,130
down this is these are pictures are all

00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:24,690
from the presentation phase they turned

00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:27,090
whether I presented their solution to

00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:30,030
the other people and just to give you an

00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:33,330
impression as virtual groups they were

00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:35,250
you can barely see there some diagrams

00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,810
already I didn't take pictures on the

00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:39,000
first place because there were no

00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:42,030
diagrams nothing at all it was just pure

00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,740
text for all of the groups so it was a

00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,120
huge difference later on for on the

00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,340
second day the last cutter

00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,020
they must barely any test text at all

00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,300
they were all really having any textured

00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,950
visions as diagrams while the first

00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,870
cutter was only text I didn't really

00:46:52,950 --> 00:47:01,440
come up with anything at all you can see

00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:03,420
it's I mean obviously these things are

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,520
not very beautiful I mean I cannot

00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:07,440
really I'm not great with painting or

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,270
some stuff as well or my diagrams are

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,430
not beautiful as well if I draw them on

00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:13,190
a whiteboard but if you're standing on a

00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:16,920
whiteboard was a couple of people or

00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:19,320
some person explaining this to you this

00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,480
is more than enough to understand what

00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:22,970
they were thinking about

00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,579
and this is much easier to explain a

00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:27,320
diagram like this then having a lot of

00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:31,640
text on there and trying to explain the

00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:34,040
text again so diagram can be much more

00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,869
clearly communicated to other developers

00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,760
to customers and trying to figure out to

00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:41,900
get all the use cases to forget anything

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,339
or is this idea working can we if you

00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,570
have use cases before and then have an

00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:45,920
architecture reason you can use the use

00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:51,500
cases to play through the architecture

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:55,160
do they work out doesn't work you can

00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:57,859
see a little more this was like I think

00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,140
recorded low key because of what was it

00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:02,300
and the English at Code West Kitty is

00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:04,849
like you have to come up with a system

00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,619
to where people can post online they

00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:10,250
lost the pet and they want to find the

00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:11,930
kitty again and everything I don't know

00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:15,040
what we what we call it low key I forgot

00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:18,470
it so here they made a couple of like

00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,180
Tia Heitor like the pet Jolla listens to

00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,710
finer who found the pets and then you

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:23,690
have multiple use kids where they can

00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,339
say ok I found your pet and now I get a

00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:27,109
reward and Cayman is involved and

00:48:25,339 --> 00:48:29,750
everything so they just draw the you

00:48:27,109 --> 00:48:31,819
skaters and then came up later under the

00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,730
bottom with some trying to come up with

00:48:31,819 --> 00:48:36,740
like an architectural of it so we're

00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:39,079
going step by step and I said it's not

00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:41,569
beautiful but it helps on the left side

00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:46,430
they were trying was like what kind of

00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:48,530
types we have a ton of attributes we

00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:50,750
need for these types we talked about

00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,890
this later because it was going in a

00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,619
little bit wrong direction but it was

00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:57,109
still ok and it helped them

00:48:53,619 --> 00:49:01,450
understanding the problem now you have

00:48:57,109 --> 00:49:03,319
just a mob pictures from the solutions

00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:04,550
the last thing I want to talk about

00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,980
because there are a little bit over the

00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:09,109
time as the Venn storming event

00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:11,510
something is a great tool and this is

00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:14,150
the tool you can use with sticky notes I

00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,200
think on a PC 16 they talked about this

00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,240
a lot of times as well it's my

00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,740
second-favorite workshop I do it's very

00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,839
great if you want to figure out the

00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,119
requirements and you can compile and

00:49:20,839 --> 00:49:25,430
combine that actually with I check

00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,810
jakarta's was a random example it's a

00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:30,050
little bit harder because for event

00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:31,640
storming you need business people more

00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:35,020
than developers because they know what

00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,020
the domain what the business is supposed

00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:40,569
this is a very great tool to understand

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,609
the requirements so it can be part of

00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:45,710
using this to understand your climates

00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:47,000
of meaning and come up with really that

00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,730
everybody's on same page and everybody

00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,349
knows what they're doing and I checked

00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,089
records can be used to trend it as well

00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:57,109
because they are for training I use a

00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:58,819
random AIT's a random sample but this

00:49:57,109 --> 00:50:00,559
solves a lot of the problems we have

00:49:58,819 --> 00:50:01,789
force and requirements so take a look at

00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,260
the event storming if you don't know it

00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:09,890
yet it's very great as well and I think

00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:11,779
that's it and I hope you learn a little

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:14,630
more about I take the cutters and up are

00:50:11,779 --> 00:50:15,680
not too disappointed thank you any I

00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:18,260
don't know if you have time for

00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,690
questions or feedback if we have some

00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:23,960
time for that quickly otherwise come to

00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:29,089
me later I don't know do we have time

00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:31,210
for some questions or maybe two

00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:34,839
questions also if there are any at all

00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:34,839
not any questions

00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,920
okay then if you have any question

00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:45,070
otherwise come to me and talk to me and

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,180
we'll be here today until I around 6

00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:48,180
p.m. thank you

00:50:49,480 --> 00:51:06,630
