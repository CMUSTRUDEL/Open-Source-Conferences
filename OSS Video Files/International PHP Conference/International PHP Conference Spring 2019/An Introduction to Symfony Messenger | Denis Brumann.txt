Symfony 4 and the introduction of Flex put a focus on enabling developers to create microservice-style applications with Symfony. In a microservice architecture, delegating tasks to other services or distributing data between these services is a challenge most monolith applications do not have to deal with. The introduction of the Messenger component in Symfony 4.1 is aimed at this problem by allowing applications to send and receive messages to/from other applications or via message queues. In my talk, I want to give you an introduction to the Messenger component by showing how it can be introduced in an existing application and what concepts and principles it is built on. In a realistic scenario we will introduce a message based architecture, look at some of the challenges that arise and how to handle them and finally take a look at what other problems can be solved using a message bus.
