Effective encryption is a vital component of a safe and secure internet, especially since the arrival of HTTP/2. Many sites and mobile apps still don‚Äôt use TLS to encrypt their traffic, often citing some kind of fear over the complexity of it all, or if they do, they make a mess of it, resulting in a literal false sense of security. The basics of TLS encryption are straightforward, but the practical realities run into a bewildering forest of acronyms. This talk gives you a breadcrumb trail through the backwoods of TLS, OCSP, ECDHE, ALPN, HTTP/2, HSTS, HPKP, CT, and more, including the latest changes in TLS 1.3.
You‚Äôll get an overview of what problems TLS solves, how it works, its component pieces, how they fit together, where vulnerabilities and mitigations apply, and what tools and resources can help you get up to speed.
