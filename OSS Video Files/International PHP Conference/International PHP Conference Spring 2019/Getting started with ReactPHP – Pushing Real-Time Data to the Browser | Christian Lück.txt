Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2019
Description: 
	Think about PHP for a few seconds‚Ä¶ What came to mind? It‚Äôs very likely you thought about your average product catalog, a blogging platform, or how the platform is inferior to things like Node.js. But wait, it‚Äôs 2019! What if I told you PHP‚Äôs huge ecosystem has way more to offer and PHP is not inferior at all to its evil cousin Node.js?

In this talk you will learn about the core concepts of async PHP and why you too should care about ReactPHP being a real thing. The talk has a strong focus on sparking the idea that PHP can be way faster and more versatile than you probably thought. Bring along an open mind, and through lots of interesting examples and live demos learn why what sounds crazy at first might soon be a valuable addition in your toolbox.

You‚Äôre already familiar with PHP and want to learn what ReactPHP is all about? Then this talk is for you! We will start from scratch and see what it takes to build an application that pushes data from your command line to your browser in real-time. You‚Äôre invited to join the interactive demos or lean back and learn more about why an event-driven approach might be the next big thing in making your application faster and more responsive.
