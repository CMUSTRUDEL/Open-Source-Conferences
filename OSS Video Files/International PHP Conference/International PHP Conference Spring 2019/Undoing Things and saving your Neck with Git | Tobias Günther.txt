Title: Undoing Things and saving your Neck with Git | Tobias Günther
Publication date: 2019-10-15
Playlist: International PHP Conference Spring 2019
Description: 
	Speaker: Tobias Günther (Tower) | https://phpconference.com/speaker/tobias-gunther/

We cannot avoid mistakes. But with the right tools, we can make sure they don’t hurt too much. Git offers many ways to undo, revert, recover and fix. We’ll look at the bad things that can happen to you – and how Git can save your neck. In this hands-on session, we’ll have a look at Git’s various undo features. My intention is to give developers more confidence in their day-to-day operations when working with code: "mistakes can be undone" is something I’d like the audience to keep in mind. In the session, I will both talk about the theory and show the corresponding commands/tools in practice. I’ll be using both Git on the command line and the popular GUI Tower to show how to deal with mistakes in real-world scenarios.
