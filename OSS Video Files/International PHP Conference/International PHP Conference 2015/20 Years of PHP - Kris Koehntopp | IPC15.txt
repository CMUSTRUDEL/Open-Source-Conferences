Publication date: 2016-06-09
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2015
Description: 
	So PHP has been celebrating its 20st anniversary this year. The little startup language which couldn't even nest control structures properly became the superglue that held the web together, and today is considered boring, mature technology. Or is it?
PHP 7 is going to clean up a few things and that is a good thing. But anything with 20 years of history is always going to have dark corners, battle scars and dirty little secrets.

The International PHP Conference is the worldâ€™s first PHP conference and stands since more than a decade for top-notch pragmatic expertise in PHP and web technologies. Internationally renowned experts from the PHP industry meet up with PHP users and developers from large and small companies.
