Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2017
Description: 
	Andrés Correa Casablanca (Adsmurai) at IPC 2017: In the last few years we’ll observed how PHP has advanced at a very fast pace improving almost all its facets (performance, consistency, security, tooling, community common practices…), but something that we haven’t seen yet is PHP as a serious option to solve problems not related to the web.

The scientific community is still small inside the PHP world, but it’s growing. In this talk we’ll discover where we are and where are we going, which pieces are missing and what we already have.

We’ll do a tour over some recent projects that are leading these efforts: machine learning, time series forecasting and other data science related problems can be solved using PHP without the need of complex technology stacks.
