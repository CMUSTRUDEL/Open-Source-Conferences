00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:13,740
so hello I'm not Ana he's not Stefan but

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,720
the deal during the rest of the keynote

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,939
we hope to not confuse you anymore so we

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,600
when we planned for that keynote we we

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:28,619
felt maybe IPC in Berlin would be the

00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,390
perfect place for that title slide but

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,649
then it feels a little safer to show

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,390
that in Munich so how hard can it be

00:00:33,649 --> 00:00:37,950
well we don't really know but at least

00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,110
we have containers so that probably

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,239
helps maybe they introduced too many

00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,160
containers are not enough containers and

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,379
that's the reason why the whole thing

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,170
okay we're not going to talk about that

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,239
airport and we have not been involved in

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,030
that the creation of that Airport

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:58,500
luckily our history goes back to 2009

00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,090
that's the year when our company was

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,309
founded and you're actually looking at

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,260
two-thirds of the company the third

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,200
partner in crime is Sebastian Backman

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,869
you may have heard of him and we at some

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,439
point figured that it might be a good

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,720
idea to create a consulting company

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,070
focusing on the Peach Pit technologies

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,299
technology stack together which is

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:20,369
really interesting because when we

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:23,220
decided that this is maybe a good idea

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:25,259
and we at some point in 2009 announced

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,850
the very fact people were coming back to

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,220
us and said like well that took us oh

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,070
well quite some time to actually do that

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,570
we're like really we thought it was like

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,630
a genius idea

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,369
and no it was actually rather obvious so

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:40,950
the thing is all of us had already been

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,990
active in the peach pspace we had spoken

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,350
at conferences we had published books

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,130
and stuff and written blogs and all

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,540
these kind of things we had initial

00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:54,090
customer relations or potential customer

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,000
relations so actually at the time I

00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,979
think everybody put in like 500 euros

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,409
into the company and that's where we

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,469
started off growing it to what what it

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,299
has become today and where we get to

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,970
travel quite a bit and work with the

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,099
really interesting companies so going

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,530
back to 2009 before we show you a

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,760
screenshot of our very first web site

00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,170
I would like to quote Reid Hoffman if

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,520
you're not embarrassed by the first

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:21,750
version of your product you have

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,330
launched too late

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,540
okay well it's arguable that our website

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:29,819
is a product but still yeah so this is

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,040
what you get when honest sits on your

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,530
couch and builds a website within one

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,350
hour I think that's pretty much the time

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,600
it took you yeah and it wasn't pretty

00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,540
back then and I don't think it became

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:47,730
any prettier since then but at least we

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,650
were online yes and we soon ran to into

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,890
a very very first big business problem

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,870
oh yeah

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:56,820
turns out if you do some work at some

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,739
point you want to get money for that so

00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:01,170
customers don't pay you if you don't

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,010
send them an invoice hmm how do you

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:09,720
create invoices well we're just a small

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:12,569
company no need for any fancy stuff no

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,120
need for any cloud-based hosting because

00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,720
we really don't want to put our data in

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,459
the cloud and not our clients data so

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,110
yeah let's go for something self hosted

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:23,940
I mean we run our own server so why

00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:30,840
should me should we be able to create

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:33,329
invoices on our own phase one well I

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,610
think we did what pretty much everybody

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,549
did we were using office software to

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:41,790
write invoices who's who started their

00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:46,859
company doing exactly that okay who's

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:48,500
still doing that well some happy some

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:55,500
people still manage yeah it's awesome

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:58,049
okay so back in the time actually it was

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,200
a legal requirement in Germany to send a

00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,810
printed invoice by mail which is exactly

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,930
what we did today we have I think one

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,329
client left and they insist on receiving

00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,560
a printed invoice which really sucks

00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,660
because they are pretty much the only

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,930
reason why we still have printed

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,750
business paper stuff in stock all the

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:22,570
others just get PDF these days back in

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,820
the time yeah we still made it out

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:26,830
and soon ran into our next big business

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,270
problem well I mean maybe you should

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,020
explain a little bit how we actually

00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:34,000
work yeah I could a good idea but since

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,800
we are the three of us and obviously we

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,150
like to be at the same client at the

00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,760
same point in time that's not very

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:43,120
likely to happen all the time and being

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:45,610
a small company we decided not to have a

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,050
general income and whoever works makes

00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,380
the money and everybody else just gets

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,240
it

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,710
no it's based on the idea that if you

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,930
work you get some money so we have to

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,120
distribute it at some point hopefully if

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,910
the client paid then you can actually

00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,400
get whatever you charge the client

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:03,580
basically just having the company as a

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,370
wrapper around it so we figured that to

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,040
make a living it's not um it does not

00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,320
it's not enough to send invoices and

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,970
write invoices but you also have to

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,540
figure out how to distribute the money

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:20,620
internally so you probably need to keep

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:24,490
some track that kind of was our first

00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:27,430
fail in on realizing well just writing

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:32,050
invoices as office documents doesn't

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:34,570
really work out so yeah let's enter

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,700
phase 2 realizing we need more so just

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,430
getting money on an account and then not

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,040
knowing who's actually whatever share of

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:43,690
that money is owned by whom so we needed

00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,070
something to verify that and of course

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,560
since we started with office software

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:51,970
what's the perfect answer for office

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,850
yeah let's create spreadsheets those are

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,830
not the real ones that we used that just

00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:03,160
stuff that we stole off the internet

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:05,770
don't worry yeah that worked great for a

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,710
while well pretty short while though

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,470
yeah it kind of allowed us to keep in

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:14,410
track who performed what work at which

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,960
client it also helped at some point to

00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:19,330
have the shared calendar and actually

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,280
put back the client appointments into

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:23,170
the calendar so if you go back to the

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,760
calendar you figure out oh I've been

00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,950
with a client on that day maybe we

00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,480
should invoice them that would help they

00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:30,220
want one of your Christmas presents a

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,050
couple of years ago when we went through

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,840
everything you like found oh we haven't

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,440
we haven't built that client nice I did

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,180
I did a few days of work and

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:41,270
so--that's makes a nice Christmas

00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:44,840
present for me yeah but then we are

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:48,830
being developers and this is the big

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,130
problem you run into spreadsheets do not

00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:54,020
scale right we're using git so basically

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:57,590
everybody has a local copy of the

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,780
spreadsheet and I'm a lazy guy traveling

00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:02,120
a lot and where I live the internet

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,180
connectivity is really crappy it is

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,560
supposed to be yes they claim that it

00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:10,880
has improved but it kind of hasn't

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,190
anyway so I make that local change and

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,580
I'm trying to push the change and kit

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:18,830
tells me because on our sebastian has

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:20,600
changed the file and hmm we are trying

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,850
to be nice and help you like okay

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,140
customer paid so he modified the flex in

00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,950
the spreadsheet that the invoice has

00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,380
been paid for

00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,730
so it actually you have you you end up

00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,470
in a merge conflict that you kind of

00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:32,750
resolve because it's a binary file

00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:34,730
hey we're developers that's stupid and

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,130
then we have so much redundancy in data

00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,900
right we're entering the same data again

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,390
in the spreadsheet that has always

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,880
already been part of the invoice which

00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:47,600
at the time we would still create using

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:50,560
office software hmm maybe we outgrew

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:53,330
that solution relatively quickly so

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,060
that's not it either even but it and

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,040
it's actually pretty tough to recognize

00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,380
even with three persons you're

00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,960
outgrowing that simple solution if you

00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:04,970
have 300 it's definitely not going to

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,570
work ever I would assume so

00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:13,360
okay so what age three to phase three

00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:19,580
indeed so let's try to eliminate

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:23,210
redundancy that means that as being

00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,950
developers let's write software mm-hmm I

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,550
mean how hard can it be to write a

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,280
simple piece of software to manage all

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:36,099
that so well that actually was back in

00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:38,450
2012 and 2013 I was heavily into

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:40,400
researching and studying the main driven

00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:43,940
development back then and figured well

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:47,270
you know I'm I'm a smart guy I have that

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,520
handled so I started to create our

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,550
office software like the domain driven

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,610
way

00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,769
or what what whatever clean fashion

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,560
clean coat fashion whatever and I

00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:02,279
promise you this is this is no lie the

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:07,019
first thing I did was well we're going

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:09,120
to get CSV files of our bank statements

00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:10,350
and I'm going to parse them because

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,529
that's all the incoming and outgoing

00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:15,990
money and then we have to link that to

00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:19,680
receipts and invoices and stuff and this

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,509
is basically where we how we keep our

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,249
records and the cool thing is giving

00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:25,410
that's a bank account obviously this is

00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:26,970
something that could be considered like

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,339
an event because that's something that

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,959
happened it cannot be changed it's not

00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,399
very likely that to come include a

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,079
mistake that we might have made because

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,449
I mean that's the bank giving us the

00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,519
data so starting from there sounds like

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,019
a very solid idea yes and and this is

00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,589
actually this is now how the weather

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:45,329
plan hits reality this is actually what

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,910
the bank gives us and if you look

00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:50,790
closely that's that's a genuine record

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:53,939
it's the very first booking that shows

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:55,620
up on 1st of January 2013 which is a

00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:59,600
public holiday that's kind of weird but

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:02,430
anyway and the booking refers to 28th of

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,120
December but they don't specify the year

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,709
there to make parsing more interesting

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,290
because it's a different year but with

00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:12,689
all the other records like the 500 ones

00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:15,540
in that file they don't specify the year

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:17,040
but the same year so that you're passing

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,100
software doesn't really know in the

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:24,269
first place for what they to assume and

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:29,250
then they charge us 16 euros and 24

00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:30,769
cents in fees which I because well you

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,589
have learned that you should represent

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:38,300
monetary values by integers to avoid the

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:40,199
flow draw rounding different issues so I

00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:44,459
pretty much did that

00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:46,379
I dropped the - and I assure you the -

00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:50,009
doesn't change anything I dropped the -

00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:53,089
because to us it's an expense so for us

00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:57,389
it's in that context it was a plus and

00:10:53,089 --> 00:11:00,839
this is the result you can actually

00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:02,819
verify that with your own computer in

00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,850
your favorite programming language it's

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:07,030
not

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:10,270
it's definitely a WTF but it's not PHP

00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:13,510
specific the scary thing is that this is

00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:15,340
neither new or actually surprising but

00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,760
when you write a parser and have that as

00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:22,240
their well this is what it boiled down

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:24,310
to but I think we found that problem at

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,960
the total sum being one cent different

00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,820
actually I wrote the whole parser and

00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,240
then I had a difference or in one cent

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:34,810
and so had started tracking that down

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,910
and the parser was even unit tested and

00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,980
then I found that well that's the

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:41,020
conversion problem and we leave it X and

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,830
egg as an exercise to you to figure that

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:48,250
one out I tend to use that as an example

00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:51,130
ever since when it comes to maybe you

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,240
want to Google for what every developer

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:57,790
needs to know about floating-point

00:11:52,240 --> 00:12:00,490
numbers okay and this is that's my

00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:05,620
software written in two thousand twelve

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:07,840
and thirteen and you may argue that it

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,670
looks pretty clean you may argue that

00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,500
there are a lot of interfaces that are

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,350
implemented which may be an indication

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,520
that it's a big object which may be a

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:21,880
problem but I'm not sure you can already

00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:26,220
spot the real problem let me show you

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:30,280
the order the order essentially is

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:34,780
derived from the bid and going back the

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:37,300
invoice is derived from the order now to

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,190
that at that point that totally makes

00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,870
sense to us because you know we're gonna

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,790
write the bid or quote to the client

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,640
some clients are going to order that

00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,680
quote and that order then turns into an

00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,540
invoice it's pretty logical so we are

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,460
passing around those objects and they

00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,370
will do get the data about the line

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,650
items and then whatnot so we exactly

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,140
know what we have to put on the invoice

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,820
and we're avoiding all the redundancy

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,570
that ever was sounds really awesome

00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:06,030
doesn't it

00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:06,030
yeah and that was really proud of that

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:16,690
until we realized that the tight

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:21,740
coupling is a big of a bit of a problem

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:25,400
because at some point a client awkwardly

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,490
asked us to send them an invoice for

00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:32,060
whatever reason and there was no quote

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:34,310
and there was no order because there was

00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:38,360
no quote obviously so we had to start

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:41,090
faking orders and quotes because our our

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,640
system would require us to do so that

00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:45,740
started feeling kind of bad but we'd

00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,500
ignore that and just cockers it's

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:51,680
basically just a simple crud style

00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:55,400
system not not anything that of really

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,890
special significance then over time we

00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:01,910
started running into very interesting

00:13:57,890 --> 00:14:05,900
business cases yeah because we at some

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:09,350
point decided that we are not

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:11,360
necessarily going to fill out all the

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:12,740
travel reports and send all the details

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,620
to our clients because that's just

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,510
merely annoying for everybody but create

00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,890
like this is a fixed sum for traveling

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:24,800
and sometimes there's not enough in that

00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,420
fixed sum because you have to put a more

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,430
expensive flight or Hotel nights turn

00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:32,240
out to be more expensive and sometimes

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,500
you make a little bit of a win problem

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,530
though is that if you travel together

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,870
like for example say that we are going

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,520
the same route we could of course take

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:42,980
two cabs so just to make sure that

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,340
everybody is gonna have their receipts

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:50,330
or we can share one but who's gonna pay

00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:52,610
that that is fixham or mine I stayed

00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:55,760
here by ideally love this gentleman but

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,760
I'm not going to pay for his taxi so we

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:01,430
had to figure out a way of splitting

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:05,450
receipts you also have to do that if you

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:08,240
happen to have client a and client B in

00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:10,520
one week and you fly a round-trip like

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,140
flying out somewhere then traveling on

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,730
maybe by plane or some other means of

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,010
transportation to somewhere else and

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,660
then flying back home which makes

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:20,030
perfect sense also from an ecological

00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,600
point of view it saves time it saves

00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,420
money

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,300
it only gets you into trouble if the

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,250
client actually asks you for okay so can

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,520
I get can I see the receipt for the

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,950
flight oh yeah well I have a flight that

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,900
doesn't start where our company is based

00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:39,230
and it doesn't end where you are based

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:41,300
basically you don't really come up in

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:42,800
that receipt but we're gonna charge you

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,540
anyway and it's most interesting

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,150
question to figure out how to divide

00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,620
that you're the first couple of hundred

00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:51,110
kilometers for that flight are going to

00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,940
be that customer the next and we

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:55,940
actually we had that problem

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:59,180
and we felt that that doesn't doesn't

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:02,990
look nice then we ran tune into the big

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,820
issue of one makes a reservation for two

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,640
or three hotel rooms because we travel

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,910
together and again it's I'm spending the

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:14,660
money so I need my company to refund me

00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,790
the money but it's half it has to be

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,130
attributed to somebody else so I paid

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:22,880
money which is cost that honor incurs

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:25,820
and so we have to when it got really

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,860
weird pretty much the same with with

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,500
flight tickets right you already cover

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:34,130
that and you kind of end up with these

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:37,870
kind of things and as a as a consultant

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:43,940
if I get to see that I'm gonna say whoa

00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:45,410
that looks like it's complex anything is

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,450
that still didn't stop us from doing it

00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:49,610
and and the weirdest thing ever we

00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,860
encountered was a multi stop travel

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,840
where you combine a client that pays for

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:57,110
travel with a conference that does not

00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,520
pay for travel because then things get

00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:05,120
totally weird so at the end of the day

00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:08,120
our very small simple software had to

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,939
know these currencies and we actually

00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:15,740
run currency converter and currency

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:18,410
conversions caching the results we would

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:20,480
invoice people in Euro or US dollar and

00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,010
well sometimes even Canadian dollar

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,970
because if you can do multi currency

00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:30,980
then have fun with multi currency and

00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:34,160
the others it's is receipts that we had

00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:37,400
to deal with our software would

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:41,780
know these countries which is quite a

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:45,200
list and those are the entities that are

00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:48,320
suffering you now most of them look

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,900
pretty familiar and normal if you look

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,450
at the remote time account you get the

00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:57,590
idea that there was big trouble ahead

00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:00,110
now usually you have a quote and you go

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,420
to work for the client you return home

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,650
everybody's happy you get money you live

00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,250
happily ever after

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:09,650
at some point client relationships

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,380
started to build up and clients actually

00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,750
would just send us an email or call us

00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,600
and say hey I have that urgent question

00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:20,210
can you please help me of course there

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,210
was no quote for that of course there

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:25,730
was no order for that but well as being

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:28,190
nice guys we usually try to help out the

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:31,040
clients and sometimes the clients even

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:34,460
expects us to send them a bill which we

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,480
couldn't because well we had to fake a

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:40,160
quote I'm faking a quote for remote it

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,830
kind of doesn't really work out so

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,080
that's why we started to introduce those

00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,110
remote time account when we basically

00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,300
would keep track of remote time that

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,310
we've worked for the clients and later

00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,040
decide whether we'd actually gonna build

00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:57,260
them or not but do you see that kills

00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:02,980
the whole idea of creating an invoice

00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:05,540
from a quote or an order so essentially

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:07,940
it started going really bad when that

00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:09,560
happened you remember that was a fun

00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,050
thing and even though flowers might be

00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,090
actually really nice it's really weird

00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,370
if you just find on your bank account

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,170
somebody paying you for a bunch of

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:21,170
flowers like thank you for the flowers

00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,660
30 euros something okay like oh wait

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:27,170
what of course our software could not

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,180
handle that which basically from an from

00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:32,480
a physical point of view brought or

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:34,580
company to a halt so we said well maybe

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,250
we can fix the problem by sending the

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:39,950
money back which we did didn't help

00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:42,950
though we came back they paid for the

00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:47,059
flowers again two days later it was some

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:50,159
error in their whatever software thing

00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:53,309
so and then I think one of the weirdest

00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:55,289
things happened where one client got two

00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:58,080
invoices and they made three wire

00:19:55,289 --> 00:20:00,600
transfers that combined together would

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,950
make up for the two invoices and of

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,110
course our software could not handle

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,029
that because our basic assumption was

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,700
well we're gonna invoice them they're

00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:09,600
gonna pay us now if you get paid from

00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,730
Canada

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,169
they'll pay Canadian dollars which the

00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,269
bank internally is gonna convert to

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:17,159
euros and take on a deductr fee so

00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:19,769
whatever money you receive is not the

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,039
amount that you put on the invoice so

00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:26,070
you have all kinds of really weird cases

00:20:22,039 --> 00:20:28,950
hmm which lead us led us to do stuff

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:31,649
like that merging together various

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,129
transactions to then assign them to

00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:38,149
receipts and I think essentially it was

00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:41,909
a total mess we were missing boundaries

00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:45,210
failed again yeah it's really scary that

00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:47,279
took us way long to realize that we are

00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:51,149
violating basic rules of software

00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:53,580
development yeah so phase four we

00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:54,929
rewrote the software and we read we

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,429
wrote the software in a decoupled

00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,399
fashion now everybody talks about

00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:02,250
coupling from a technology point of view

00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:04,950
but now looking back I realized that we

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,139
were tightly coupled in our minds

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,509
because our whole business was just that

00:21:07,139 --> 00:21:12,480
one thing we are looking at it as a

00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:15,029
whole one thing without any clear

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,320
boundaries and separations that's why we

00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:20,879
build a monolith even as a small company

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,860
well it sounds like it's one process

00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:24,929
that we are dealing with it completely

00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:29,009
ignoring it's actually not so now we

00:21:24,929 --> 00:21:32,759
have invoices that don't even know line

00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:34,559
items in a certain context because it's

00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:37,019
just a total amount in the net amount

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,419
and the optional country I don't

00:21:37,019 --> 00:21:40,110
actually know why that we why we need

00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,879
that one

00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,129
but anyway further and rendering

00:21:41,879 --> 00:21:49,200
actually okay determine what language

00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:51,750
template to use yeah so this is the

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,580
invoice that we use in the context of

00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:56,220
the software that helps us distribute

00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:59,580
the money we don't even know about line

00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,190
items but this is how we build the

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,679
invoice actually we write a PHP script

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,230
let's assume that we earn 42 euros

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:08,940
that's the net amount somebody's gonna

00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:11,070
put that somewhere I think Anna has

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:13,230
created a life template in our IDE for

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:16,110
that so essentially it's just entering

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:19,409
those two numbers and this PHP code

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:21,690
allows us to then run our software this

00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:24,809
is code that we use to render the whole

00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:27,720
thing we're using latex to render PDF

00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:30,570
just in case you were interested and you

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,029
might think well it's it's kind of

00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,730
interesting but this could only possibly

00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:39,510
ever happen to a small company if you

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:43,289
think everything is so simple well turns

00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:46,230
out not really there are large

00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:49,169
corporations doing really weird good

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:54,149
things and one of our clients happened

00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:58,440
to probably made one blank slide in

00:22:54,149 --> 00:23:00,419
between okay one of our client this or

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,940
was depending on how you see it they

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:06,360
change their business model little

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,730
selling time of their employees or they

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:11,309
even get individual people to contract

00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:14,159
for them and then send to whatever kind

00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:16,320
of their customers and it was really

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,440
cool for them because it's really easily

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,510
scalable and very well efficient

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,210
business model whatever amount of hours

00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:25,470
people work you multiply that by an

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,119
hourly rate that you're gonna charge for

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,779
those people and that's the total that

00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,269
you're gonna win

00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:35,779
so that's easy so basically you work on

00:23:30,269 --> 00:23:38,309
timesheets and this worked great and

00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:40,500
they figured that basically we are gonna

00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,210
invoice from the timesheet which is

00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,340
exactly the same thing that we did at a

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:48,389
smaller scale the cool thing is that

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:51,750
this actually works relatively cool and

00:23:48,389 --> 00:23:57,360
it's not necessarily problematic unless

00:23:51,750 --> 00:24:01,379
you try to have other people participate

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,720
in in the winnings so saying that let's

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:07,500
say the amount of hours that you created

00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:09,480
what are you doing um there should be an

00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,590
image coming up which isn't I'm seeing

00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,100
it here and I'm seeing

00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:17,669
blank screen there don't ever ask me why

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:23,700
do you want to try I do believe you

00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:26,850
so imagine seeing an image of like like

00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:30,809
a Swiss clock maker putting in

00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:33,750
wheels into a thing and it says this

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:35,840
costs 2,000 euros I'm going to try to

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:38,419
fix that by moving the other screen over

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,980
if I find out where the mouse pointer is

00:24:38,419 --> 00:24:43,169
yeah that's the reason why you should

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,140
not rely on presenter consoles to work

00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:47,610
so that's the image I was describing it

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,010
wasn't what you had in your mind but

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:52,529
anyway so now you're building something

00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,570
that takes that costs 2,000 euros and

00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:57,380
that's exactly what that client started

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:59,940
doing it's project work essentially and

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,039
let's assume that it takes somebody the

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:06,120
whole week to build a thing then the

00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,899
problem is that you end up with 2025

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:09,750
euros

00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:12,149
based on these hours and the hourly rate

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:15,029
and that's not what your client expects

00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:18,929
you to build them so what they did was

00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:21,539
that well we are creating our invoices

00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:24,000
from the timesheet so we're gonna make

00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:25,590
the timesheets fit and since they can't

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,720
cheat on the time that people have

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:33,960
worked they just reduced the hourly rate

00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:37,470
which land yes they did so going back

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,630
half a year and of course everything

00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:42,929
else depended on that like people's

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:45,929
salaries which would fluctuate tax

00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:48,510
reports which the tax office did not

00:25:45,929 --> 00:25:51,659
like bonuses all kinds of nice things

00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:54,539
and the funny thing is it's exactly the

00:25:51,659 --> 00:26:00,779
same problem that we had at the small

00:25:54,539 --> 00:26:03,000
scale okay so it's like you know that's

00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:05,610
the waterfall that the idea of the

00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:09,470
waterfall always have has been to to

00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:12,000
stand up there on the edge and jump down

00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:13,440
it's called going down the waterfall and

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:17,070
you'll never be you're never ever gonna

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:19,260
be seen again and this gentleman is Kent

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,820
Beck you can clearly tell that he's

00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:26,379
afraid of the waterfall

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:29,259
okay he's one of the authors of extreme

00:26:26,379 --> 00:26:31,600
programming dating back to the turn of

00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:33,970
the millennium where one of the things

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,460
he said is well development should be

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:40,600
not waterfall and not that stuff that we

00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:44,109
always tried but it should be coding

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,759
testing listening and designing and he

00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:46,330
coined terms like yakhni you ain't gonna

00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,080
need it

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:54,809
don't build software unless you need it

00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:57,879
mm one who has read the agile manifesto

00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:01,169
everybody needs to please go take that

00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:03,309
as a homework read the agile manifesto

00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:06,549
essentially one of the things the agile

00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:08,320
manifesto says close daily cooperation

00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,539
between business people and developers

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,159
well it's kind of a problem if you are

00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:13,629
in your own business you are the

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,940
business people and you still don't have

00:27:13,629 --> 00:27:18,389
a clue maybe that's just like in real

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:21,669
life anyway

00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:25,599
Along Came domain driven design the book

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:28,509
written by Eric Evans in 2003 where he

00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:31,960
basically says we need collaboration

00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:35,710
between technical and domain experts so

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:37,749
it's not about writing JIRA tickets with

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:39,989
solutions that we think we need

00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:42,340
it's about discussing the problem

00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:44,080
between business people and developers

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,369
and it's not about writing software

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,960
either at least not in the first place

00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:52,659
yes and all that the most important

00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,869
concept that Evans gaves us is the

00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:57,639
bounded context which is exactly what we

00:27:55,869 --> 00:28:00,309
were missing out in our software which

00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:02,409
we may missing out in our brain since it

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:04,779
was our own company we never really

00:28:02,409 --> 00:28:06,220
thought about it and we figured that

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:07,809
everything is just the same we are

00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,419
basically going to create invoices

00:28:07,809 --> 00:28:12,009
because we have to we never thought

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:13,840
about the fact that we have for one

00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:16,389
creating invoices so that we get the

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,759
money number two for tax reasons because

00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:21,999
we have to report those invoices to tax

00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,590
office number three we need some means

00:28:21,999 --> 00:28:25,960
to internally distribute money

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:28,210
number four we somehow keep two kept

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,119
people have to keep track of our costs

00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:33,610
it's completely different requirements

00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:36,190
is completely different contexts that we

00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:39,490
and if you build software that sponge

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,049
multiple contexts you are likely bound

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,030
for trouble now if you want to know what

00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:45,549
a bounded context is we have a brilliant

00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:48,159
explanation yeah I mean it's having like

00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:49,510
wires there so that's kind of a bounded

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,000
context in the middle like of this thing

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,860
it's nice for fighting it's a box

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,870
fighting arena so of course you need

00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:00,220
boxers right I mean otherwise that's not

00:28:55,870 --> 00:29:02,950
boxing so let's get boxers well okay

00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:05,470
maybe not this kind of boxer yep

00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,169
now you've learned all about bounded

00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:10,000
contexts it is the same term has a

00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:13,059
completely different meaning in

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,010
different contexts and in a business all

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:18,429
that is closed together so it's really

00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:21,880
hard to make a clean distinction between

00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:23,620
which context are we in and if you mix

00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,960
up those contexts if they are blurry

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:30,250
then you end up with monoliths just like

00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,440
we did back in 2013 you're Tina SHhhh I

00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:35,830
think we started to rewrite the software

00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,570
in phase four and if you've ever heard

00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,080
as consultants if you've ever heard us

00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:42,940
say dear client you built a monolith and

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,570
you shouldn't have done so let's talk

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:49,659
about how you can avoid building more of

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:53,039
a monolith in the future we know what we

00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:56,890
are talking about so to conclude with

00:29:53,039 --> 00:30:00,220
Eric Evans once said domain driven

00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:02,909
design is not for everybody and I'm not

00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:06,130
sure I agree I think what he means is

00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,830
domain driven design is something that

00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:10,960
really needs needs a deep investment and

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,240
involvement in working with the business

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,340
and understanding the business and it's

00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,270
not about writing software that's just

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:21,340
an artifact it's about communication I

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:24,610
think that fundamentally should be part

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,380
of every software development process if

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,270
it's not worth developing the software

00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,919
because their stock software for that

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,340
well then don't develop software buy

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:35,409
off-the-shelf shop software but do that

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,970
during the analysis phase you still want

00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:39,190
to make sure that you understand what

00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:41,860
you need and what your software needs to

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:44,230
do so I don't think it's gonna work out

00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:46,270
to decide early on oh that's just a

00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:47,140
simple problem let's not apply domain

00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,720
driven design

00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,450
that which we kind of did in phase 1 and

00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,210
phase 2 it's just a simple problems just

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:59,170
crud it's just data entry no it's not it

00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:01,600
starts small but then it grows the funny

00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,880
thing is that if you use any type of

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,280
stock software chances are that you are

00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,110
faced with the option of not doing

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:10,300
something because the software doesn't

00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:11,530
support it or change your business so

00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,620
that it works with that software that

00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:15,460
you just picked and we definitely

00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:17,050
realized we don't want to be in that

00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:19,510
situation because we wanted to do the

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,480
business the way we wanted to do is in

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,720
sharing some of the cost getting other

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,010
stuff distributed all those things so

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,660
after looking around a little bit I mean

00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:33,040
of course we did not decide it directly

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:34,810
to only buy software or not buy software

00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,100
because we are programmers and we might

00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:38,350
be able to actually write the software

00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,120
but we didn't find anything that was

00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,390
supporting us in what we were actually

00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:46,630
trying to do so that was our reason to

00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:49,090
start writing software ourselves and one

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:52,450
of the main mistakes that that basically

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:54,670
had me spend whenever I was traveling I

00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:59,440
took out my laptop and worked on our

00:31:54,670 --> 00:32:02,890
software we let the Tex law basically

00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,650
invade our company so we have of course

00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:09,160
a tax advisor who does the official book

00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:11,980
records keeping for us and they do

00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,280
things quite differently then we had to

00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:17,620
do them and initially we wanted to have

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,420
the numbers match because we all know we

00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,190
are developers I want to see the numbers

00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,090
match because that's kind of my my

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:28,120
integration test yeah if tax advisor

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:30,910
gets to the same result than we do then

00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,710
the things have to match great and maybe

00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,690
at some point we can get even rid of the

00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:36,790
tax advisor we actually thought about

00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:39,670
that for a while thought we might save

00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:44,290
some cost if we could do that it turns

00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:49,330
out that you really can't comprehend

00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:52,900
text law and it changes every year so I

00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:56,110
would assume that tax advisers might be

00:32:52,900 --> 00:33:00,040
able to comprehend that but not regular

00:32:56,110 --> 00:33:01,090
people like us so we kind of learned the

00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,409
very very hard way that

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:05,799
we have to give up on that so

00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:09,610
technically we have a bounded context

00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:12,279
which is the tax law and this bounded

00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:15,249
context is being represented by our tax

00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:20,470
advisor and we don't care about all of

00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:22,120
that essentially we sign some papers we

00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,620
do actually read them before we sign

00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,690
them there was never an order for a

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,499
washing machine I know that but the rest

00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:30,850
of the numbers is like yeah kind of

00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:32,440
that's the amount of taxes that we have

00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:36,460
to pay well then so be it

00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:38,230
we really don't understand that and we

00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,850
we honestly gave up on understanding

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,039
that the only thing we actually check

00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,409
for is that whatever kind of final

00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:47,470
results he comes up with and what our

00:33:44,409 --> 00:33:49,240
software determines to be what we think

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,940
is the real world and if the numbers

00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,039
match up somehow then we are kind of

00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:56,799
happy because that's close enough

00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:58,570
which actually again is the scaling

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,850
factor because like this client that we

00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,320
just spoke about they actually had the

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:03,820
very same kind of issue that their

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,230
internal software how they managed all

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,929
that stuff and the official reporting

00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:10,659
was not actually the same thing and well

00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:12,220
if let's put it that way the amount of

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,560
money they are happy with if they are

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,990
close enough is not what I would be very

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,629
happy with they make a lot more money

00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:21,849
and they ignore a lot bigger of a

00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:23,829
difference I remember being there one

00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:26,349
day when they were searching for half a

00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:28,240
million dollars and that was even too

00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:30,669
much for their taste so they were really

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,619
nervous yeah but when they went down to

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:36,669
like 100,000 they were like well that's

00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:40,060
not worth want to know how they found

00:34:36,669 --> 00:34:43,119
the money basically it it it all boils

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:46,929
down to we changed some records in the

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,169
database admittedly that's not the

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:51,790
software they run the tax reports of

00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:52,990
likely not because that's audited that

00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:55,480
would be really weird if they could do

00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:57,369
that so there's at least two more

00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,069
observations that I'd like to share the

00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:03,150
number one thing why I have a love/hate

00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:07,180
relationship with honor he has an

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:09,130
extraordinary good gut feeling if you

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,130
discuss anything technical with him and

00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:14,380
Anna's gonna say like it doesn't feel

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:14,990
quite right or I don't know if I'm

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,390
convinced

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,490
you can be pretty sure that something's

00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,230
wrong that's gonna fall on your feet at

00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,250
some point and I've learned to trust

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,600
that gut feeling

00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:27,770
then the hate part comes from an is

00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,750
exceptionally good at looking at stuff

00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:32,420
and saying I don't think that's a real

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:35,060
case and if it is I wouldn't want to

00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:36,640
solve that so let's try to avoid the

00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,260
problem in the first place

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,970
so essentially what he did whenever I

00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:43,580
had I was spending a lot of time

00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:45,290
thinking about well I was designing our

00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:48,080
business processes as I wrote the

00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:49,520
software literally and I said well we

00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,619
need to figure out a way of splitting

00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,350
those receipts and how we do we do that

00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:56,630
and how do we record that and where what

00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:59,720
does that affect and I built all that

00:35:56,630 --> 00:36:01,369
and then I was so proud and showed it to

00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,490
the guys saying hey look at what I've

00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:07,130
built and then I look at science and you

00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:09,110
know I don't think we want to solve that

00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,780
problem in the first place maybe we

00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:14,390
should avoid it and then we had some

00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:17,210
discussions that ended us realizing that

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,910
we don't want that feature we want we

00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:23,090
don't want that software to exist in the

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:26,660
first place so yeah we removed it again

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:29,170
and really sorry though yes tell em yeah

00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:32,450
that's learning the hard way right so

00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:34,520
whenever we advise think about the

00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:39,590
problem and understand the problem first

00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:41,359
before you build any solutions I think

00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:43,670
we have very valid reasons to do that

00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,670
because we have our own experience that

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:49,760
it's really quite frustrating to build

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:51,350
stuff only to realize that what's so

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,060
complicated we don't want to be doing

00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:56,390
that in the first place and then we

00:36:53,060 --> 00:37:01,100
moving it and well removing all the side

00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:05,270
effects that had well yeah what was that

00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:08,840
planning can you know it over hours of

00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:12,080
programming can you save like weeks of

00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:13,700
programming can save hours of careful

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:16,630
planning yes yeah exactly

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:16,630
that was the way

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:26,500
okay so the message we want to leave you

00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:29,260
with I think as an industry we need to

00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,440
rethink software development we cannot

00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:35,020
do software development the way we've

00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,540
always done it because so many people

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:41,200
have learned that that way does not work

00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:44,500
or it does not work good enough we need

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,210
to rethink what we can change and that's

00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:49,119
not about technology it's about

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:51,910
communication it's about how development

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,640
and the rest of the business interacts

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:57,760
I hate being with teams that talk about

00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:00,970
us and them well they have requirements

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,190
and then if you ultimately get to the

00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:04,660
point like the other point I don't think

00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:06,220
you want to have this problem and

00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:08,710
basically I think that that whole

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:13,540
software module should not have been

00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:16,810
written then somebody's gonna say yeah

00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:19,990
but they required us to write that they

00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:21,250
and I think that's the wrong thinking it

00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:24,990
should be us

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:28,869
we have decided um another observation

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,060
there was a meeting in with Anna and

00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:34,420
Sebastian like you met I think for two

00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:37,690
days in Hamburg designing parts of the

00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:40,119
software that we use now and as part of

00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,560
that like refining our process so how

00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:43,570
should we do it in the first place

00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,030
basically it's bent they spent the two

00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:48,369
days talking about the process and then

00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:52,810
there was some software being developed

00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:57,280
subsequently and I was not part of that

00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:59,470
meeting and to this day I do not fully

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,680
understand what we are doing in that

00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,450
area and why we are doing that I'm

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:06,190
continuously still confused and I really

00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:07,960
have a hard time understanding that just

00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:10,900
because I was not part of that meeting

00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,030
so maybe that's an incentive to say hey

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,580
let's really get together as a group

00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:17,650
initially and get clear on what the

00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:20,200
whole thing is about what's the business

00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,690
about what why are we doing that and how

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,790
should we do it best and then get into a

00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,730
conversation how we can automate that

00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:30,700
the fun part was that we spend literally

00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,990
two days discussing and on the first

00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,430
day in the morning figured like okay

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:38,260
what are we going to do the two days I

00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:39,670
mean how hard can it be so we discussed

00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:41,380
some things and Danny okay this is

00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:43,599
getting more complicated again so let's

00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,770
scrap that and start over and I think we

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,619
spend like three or four iterations

00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:49,390
until we realize okay we are still

00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:51,670
trying to just rewrite the original

00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:53,349
software and we're not trying to solve a

00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:55,270
problem that we are actually having and

00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,859
by the time we realize that then it

00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,329
suddenly became really easy because like

00:39:56,859 --> 00:40:00,550
wow this is a simple problem this is

00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:02,440
let's handle the invoices don't care

00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:05,290
about anything else let's do that and

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,020
then do the other part and vote small

00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:09,730
pieces that ended up being well what we

00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,530
consider our controlling software but

00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,849
it's still only tiny pieces that

00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:14,980
actually don't really know much about

00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:18,070
each other and whether you want to use a

00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:21,010
term or not what what we have learned to

00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:27,369
do that's the main driven design yeah

00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:29,440
well thanks for listening if you have

00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:33,660
any questions I think we have a few

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,660
minutes and we can take a few questions

00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:46,590
