Description: 
	Terrence Ryan (Google) at IPC 2017: Different jobs require different tools. There are times where PHP isnâ€™t the right tool for the job. When those times arise, Go can be a great alternative tool to use. Go is a compiled programming language created by Google and used in emerging tools like Docker and Kubernetes. This session will take you through the basics of Go, compare and contrast it with PHP, and give you some pointers as to what problem areas can you best use Go to compliment your PHP applications.
