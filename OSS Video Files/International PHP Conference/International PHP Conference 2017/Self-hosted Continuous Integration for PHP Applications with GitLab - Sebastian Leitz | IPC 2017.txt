Title: Self-hosted Continuous Integration for PHP Applications with GitLab - Sebastian Leitz | IPC 2017

Description: 
	Sebastian Leitz (ETES GmbH) at IPC 2017: Over the course of some years, we established a workflow for developing PHP APIs or web applications which we’d like to share with you. We’re a German company, and the business model is very focused on data security and self-hosted solution with maximum control over where the data resides and who has access to it. We try to stay away from Travis CI and the likes without cut back on features.
Using GitLab, PhpStorm, Docker, Codeception, PSR-7 middleware, Zend Framework, Doctrine, custom migration routines, messaging and more we created and refined a self-hosted setup for developing our applications.
Together, we can set up a new demo project and discover the steps necessary to travel from idea to deployment. This is only based on our best practices, so hopefully it is relatable to your daily business, tasks and perspectives. Maybe it can help you refine your own workflow or move away from cloud services. We’d also love to get feedback and discuss further optimisations with you.
