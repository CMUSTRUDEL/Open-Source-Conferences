Description: 
	Web applications and specifically Single Page Applications leverage the power of our computers and give a fast, fluent experience to users who have a strong wifi connection. But a huge proportion of web activity is done on mobile devices, which require different capabilities, such as minimizing data usage and power consumption. Native mobile applications also introduce additional features to engage the users, such as notifications. But they lack some of the features web applications have. Today’s technology and rapid browsers’ advancement allow us to enjoy the best of both worlds. We can write web applications with a native mobile app look and feel. We can run these applications on desktop browsers and enjoy the features introduced by native mobile apps. In this talk Shmuela Jacobs (ngGirls) will present the wonderful world of possibilities with Progressive Web Applications, and how Angular helps you to enter this world.
