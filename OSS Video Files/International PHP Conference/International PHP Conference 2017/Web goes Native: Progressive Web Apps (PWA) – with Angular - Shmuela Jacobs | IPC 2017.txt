Title: Web goes Native: Progressive Web Apps (PWA) – with Angular - Shmuela Jacobs | IPC 2017
Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2017
Description: 
	Web applications and specifically Single Page Applications leverage the power of our computers and give a fast, fluent experience to users who have a strong wifi connection. But a huge proportion of web activity is done on mobile devices, which require different capabilities, such as minimizing data usage and power consumption. Native mobile applications also introduce additional features to engage the users, such as notifications. But they lack some of the features web applications have. Today’s technology and rapid browsers’ advancement allow us to enjoy the best of both worlds. We can write web applications with a native mobile app look and feel. We can run these applications on desktop browsers and enjoy the features introduced by native mobile apps. In this talk Shmuela Jacobs (ngGirls) will present the wonderful world of possibilities with Progressive Web Applications, and how Angular helps you to enter this world.

[Music]

00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:16,139
okay hi everybody how are you doing

00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:20,189
how's the conference so far good yeah

00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:23,430
alright so it's a 4:00 in the afternoon

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,760
you're already after a few talks and I

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:31,500
will try to see something a bit more

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:37,040
dynamic and to see how we progressed if

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:44,180
I our web applications with angular and

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:46,590
this is going to be live demo session so

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:51,000
hopefully everything will be okay of

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,059
course I went to my private room and

00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,579
prayed a little bit to the god of life

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:03,420
demos and so usually she hears me she

00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:10,260
listens to me

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:12,450
so hopefully also today okay so I'm more

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,619
like Jacobs and just a little bit about

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:19,560
myself before we start I'm front-end

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,259
developer consultant and a trainer I've

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,650
been working with front-end for the past

00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,900
few years three years I think and I

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,650
started working with angularjs and of

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:39,650
course and now I moved on to angular

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:46,619
it's just angular angular 2 4 8 16 32

00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:50,820
and before that I also worked a little

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:57,290
bit with C++ Java Python and the other

00:01:50,820 --> 00:02:00,420
stuff so if you're coming from other aim

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,329
from other worlds other programming

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,590
languages I hear you I know I know how

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:09,270
it feels like yeah but I fell in love

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,650
with angular and

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:17,520
that's what I loved to do until now so

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:22,740
what I do in my free time on organizing

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:26,460
ng girls so this is currently the main

00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,700
activity is workshops that are free for

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:33,570
women who are beginners in the in the

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,930
programming world maybe their students

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:41,330
and they come and participate in this

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:44,670
workshop there's a tutorial that shows

00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:48,020
them tell them how to build their very

00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:53,100
own angular application from scratch and

00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:56,610
they sit with mentors and just sit the

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:59,640
whole day and they have a working

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,410
application by the end of the day so

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,780
that's really great the mentor is also

00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,800
volunteer they're experienced web

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,350
developers they can be girls or guys is

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,450
so if you're interested in this activity

00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:15,120
we're doing workshops all around the

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,230
world I don't have to be in every

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,840
workshop so you can organize something

00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:24,450
by yourself and I will help you and I

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,460

do in my free time is I organize the

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:08,550
angular Knights meetup in in Israel it's

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:10,980
it's a meet-up that's about angular of

00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,650
course and its ecosystem and learning by

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:18,780
doing learning from the through the

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,640
keyboard a with the fingers so if you

00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,770
are in Israel you're very welcome to

00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,729
come and if you

00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,400
to talk about anything that's related to

00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:33,330
web to angular and the ecosystem then

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,470
I'd love to have you alright so let's go

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:41,280
back to our main topic today progressive

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:46,349
web applications so what is progressive

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,590
web applications let me ask you how many

00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:53,940
of you are already working progress off'

00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:58,500
eyeing your web applications okay great

00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:01,319
we have quite a few how many of you are

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,669
working with web applications developing

00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:08,220
web applications okay so all of you are

00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:12,810
going to progressive by your web apps

00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:16,740
air right after this talk how many of

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:21,360
you are working with angular okay great

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:24,650
so we're in the right place so I will

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,270
give a bit of an intro about what

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:30,060
progressive web application is where it

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:34,680
comes from and then we'll start doing

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:39,360
the demo okay so a little bit of

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:42,539
unofficial history we're developing for

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,300
the web and we know that the browsers

00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:51,110
and the computers have become stronger

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:54,080
in the past few years so we have

00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:58,500
computers that can run really

00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,180
complicated logic and calculations so we

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,380
can do everything on the computer

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,500
instead of on browse on servers the

00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,870
Wi-Fi connection that we're using is

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:13,860
usually strong so we can send a lot of

00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:19,020
data and to the client and let the

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:22,349
client deal with this data something

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,870
that we like about web applications or

00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:28,770
websites is that they're linkable if you

00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:32,550
enter a in a certain state in the

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:34,320
application then if this application if

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,210
it's for example a single page

00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:41,340
application and it uses a

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:44,160
router then there's a specific URL for

00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,380
every state in this application and you

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,979
can just copy this and send it to your

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,530
friends and share it so you can share a

00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,120
state in the application and that's

00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,819
really nice and you can share the

00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:01,440
application itself because eventually

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:04,259
it's just a website but that does a lot

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,960
more than just show you text and images

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:16,580
and maybe a few links and so it is very

00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:21,990
very powerful but like I said in a a

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:26,190
panel that we had in the morning who who

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,750
doesn't have a mobile phone and in every

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:29,970
all the time right

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,280
we don't always carry around our laptops

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,440
but we do have the mobile phone and the

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,330
mobile phones are like little computers

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:38,849
there are there and that's like their

00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:42,930
they are actually little computers with

00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:48,000
also very strong capabilities so we

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:50,159
start using them for a for using

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,199
applications for managing our whole life

00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:58,039
actually and mobile applications have a

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,060
lot of advantages to them they're

00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:05,430
installable so whenever you want to use

00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:08,430
the application you have an icon and you

00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:10,440
just click it and it opens right so you

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:16,560
don't have to search it or enter a URL

00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:19,289
and it gives you a notification so even

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,159
if you haven't used the application for

00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,949
a long time

00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:28,289
whenever something important happens and

00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:30,840
it can notify you and just you know give

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:33,390
you this message and tells you click on

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,880
me and do something about it so it's

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:39,510
engaged well it's it's engaging the

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,880
users it uses the device API and the

00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,699
devices that we have have have a lot of

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,180
capabilities of hardware that we can use

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,279
the

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:54,810
the GPS location of course calling

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:58,200
someone by the phone um and of C and so

00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,670
on so it can use all of this the

00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,760
applications can use all of these

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,880
features so that's really great but

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:09,740
there are a few things that we started

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:15,750
not really liking about native

00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:17,730
applications and they also they start

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,870
improving okay so some of the things

00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:24,270
here are getting better so for example

00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:30,450
you need to search the application in

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:32,220
the store okay actually this this week I

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,950
had a weird case where I was searching

00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:40,709
an application and I just couldn't find

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:43,020
it and I knew that it exists so turns

00:09:40,709 --> 00:09:46,200
out that this application was not

00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,930
available in the region that I'm in and

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,430
I don't know how to change the region

00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:59,510
and something there just went really

00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:04,290
wrong so that was really really weird so

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:06,860
so you have to use the store to search

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:09,000
for or to download the application

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,060
sometimes you can get a link to the

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,550
store so that's nice the applications

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:19,850
are not linkable you can't enter a

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:23,310
certain State in a native application I

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:27,860
like unlike the web applications that we

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:30,329
talked about you need permissions for

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,760
everything when you install the

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:35,220
application first thing it tells you

00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,890
okay I need permission for your contacts

00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,980
for your phone to get pictures actually

00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:44,640
now it's getting a lot better because

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:47,579
you get notified for permissions before

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,290
you do some actions so when you try to

00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:51,930
take a picture through the application

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:54,750
for the first time then it tells you hey

00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,180
this application needs your permission

00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:58,339
to take photos but also the permissions

00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,009
that you get

00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:05,779
when installing it can be really

00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:07,870
frightening for the users so so that's

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:11,620
also a downside

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:16,670
and when you're using a web application

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:18,589
then you can it doesn't ask you anything

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:21,350
because it doesn't have access to

00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:25,160
anything only when you try you actually

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:30,110
try to use something on your way like

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:35,749
the camera and updates well some updates

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:38,839
can happen in the background but most of

00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:42,259
the updates especially if you need new

00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,059
permissions then you have to click on it

00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:47,629
oh yeah I want to update it

00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:50,269
oh no why is the update so large why do

00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:52,309
I have to download now fifty megabytes

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:56,779
or 100 megabytes just to update the

00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:59,990
application so you know this really

00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,790
makes the users think again whether they

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,379
want to update whether they want to use

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,610
the application whether they want to

00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:09,410
install it and of course with mobile

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:10,939
applications you also need to think

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:14,929
about whether you're developing for

00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:17,089
Android or iOS or something else and you

00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:22,160
have different code bases maybe and

00:12:17,089 --> 00:12:24,139
that's also a whole different story so

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,149
progressive web applications have to

00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,790
actually give you the best of both

00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:33,679
worlds

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:37,699
so the apps are linkable the you don't

00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:40,579
need to install them from the a store

00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:43,309
but you have the option to install them

00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:45,769
once you enter the application on the

00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:49,879
browser and then you get an icon that

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:52,759
you can just click and it it will open

00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:56,839
the application and if you use this it

00:12:52,759 --> 00:13:00,439
can also give you a very native look and

00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:03,139
feel to the application so at some point

00:13:00,439 --> 00:13:05,449
you might even forget it this is

00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,900
actually a web application running on

00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:10,140
the browser

00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:17,220
and the updates are always done in the

00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:21,570
background and and also web applications

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:26,810
now can access the native features the

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:26,810
hardware that you have on the phone so

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:34,260
so that's great and what's really really

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,570
great is that you write one application

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,120
with one one time you have to write your

00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:42,570
logic your JavaScript and it can run

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:48,420
both on the computer or on the mobile

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:52,260
phone okay so we'll talk in a moment

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:56,310
about the hardware that it can access

00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:59,339
the camera and so on these are the 10

00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:01,560
pillars of progressive web applications

00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:05,040
so what does it mean when you want to

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,880
your application to be progressive so

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,770
I'm not going to go over this really

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:16,050
deeply I'm just going to touch a few

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:19,589
points here so well progressive it uses

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:22,550
new features it uses the the best

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,550
practices and

00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:29,130
all the new things that the web gives us

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,670
allowed us to do the browser's allow us

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,779
to do

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:37,020
it's discoverable you can search it eh

00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:39,480
eh you know on the web and Google or any

00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:42,839
other search engine that you'd prefer

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,450
and you can find it because it's

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:51,500
actually a website but you can also find

00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:54,690
it on the store the the search engines

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,279
when they crawl the web they recognize

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,089
these web applications which are

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:03,000
progressive web applications and some of

00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:06,060
them actually take this and show them on

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,730
the store now it might take time ok so

00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,860
you don't find them immediately but

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,510
eventually they'll be there

00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,910
they're linkable like I said because

00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:19,240
there are web applications they're app

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:23,380
like so us developers need to

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:27,010
about how to do the look and feel to

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:31,120
make it more apt like to use scrolling

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:33,610
and menus the way you use in native

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,630
applications so you need a different

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:41,529
version that will run on your mobile

00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:48,459
phone a slightly different version which

00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:51,940
is mostly and this the display is a bit

00:15:48,459 --> 00:15:55,000
different and maybe you will also have

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:59,080
different features because things that

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,020
look good on a big screen will not work

00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,750
on a little screen of the mobile so you

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,399
have to think about what features you

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:11,320
allow on the mobile and what features

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:17,200
you allow on the web and computers and a

00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:23,860
large screen so it's responsive so the

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:29,790
same idea here that it will look good on

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,790
every screen connectivity independent

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:35,200
well of course the first time that you

00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:38,800
want to access the application you'll

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,790
need internet connection but we're used

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,500
to having our applications on the mobile

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:49,870
working even when we offline so it can

00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:53,320
show you some data you can perform some

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:55,779
actions and it can even save some

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,930
actions that you do so it will later on

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:02,459
sync them to the server so the same

00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,459
thing you can do with web applications

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,410
it's reengage Abell that's mostly about

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,720
the notifications let the talk up and

00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:19,890
talked about its installable like I said

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:23,470
and it's fresh and fresh means that it's

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:27,790
not only that it's cool and fresh but it

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:31,000
also gives you the freshest data the

00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,680
latest data from the server if you're

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,470
connected to

00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:40,870
a strong internet connection to Wi-Fi or

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:43,690
so on on the other hand it will not give

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:51,600
you too much data it will not load you

00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:55,210
with with heavy communication it because

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,990
it will slow down the application on one

00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:01,750
hand on the other hand it might increase

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:05,040
the battery usage which is also

00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:08,260
something that we want to prevent in in

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,150
mobile applications okay so these are

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,740
things that you need to think about when

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,170
you develop a progressive web

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,540
application because when we're working

00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:18,370
with the computer then we don't always

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,750
think about it we say okay we have the

00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:23,410
Wi-Fi connection it doesn't really

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:26,320
matter how much data is being sent to

00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:29,830
the computer okay it might take a bit

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,630
longer than usual if we have a large

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,780
chunks of data so it's also not really

00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:37,360
really great for the user but usually

00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:42,820
the computers are connected to the

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:46,540
electricity so there's no problem with

00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,550
the battery and so on progressive web

00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:53,320
applications are safe they're using safe

00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:55,870
a secure connection HTTPS and you have

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,850
to keep the it this way they won't work

00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,560
like a lot of the features will not work

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:01,780
if you're not using a safe connection

00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:05,110
and of course you have to think about

00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:10,780
other security issues that might be

00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:18,670
relevant for mobile applications all

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:23,830
right so I talked about using the native

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:26,740
mobile API with the web application so

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,470
you might think hey so the browser does

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,290
it has access to all these things well

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:34,240
yes browser has access to a lot of the

00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:38,880
things it can do a lot of things that

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:42,730
the mobile can do it is very strong

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,910
nowadays now it's not perfect still

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:50,110
but this is taken from a website called

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:53,080
what web can do today and I'm sorry the

00:19:50,110 --> 00:20:01,420
link was in a different color it's what

00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:04,060
web can do that today and um and it gets

00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:06,820
updated all the time ok so you can see

00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:09,810
that we have of course geolocation we

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:13,510
have offline my own local notifications

00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:16,000
you know like you probably noticed all

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:19,210
these websites that ask you for

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,760
permission to show notifications even on

00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:27,310
the computer not on your mobile ok so I

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:33,100
have a slide about it later on so keep

00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:37,380
this in mind um it asks for permissions

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:42,460
what if it can use Bluetooth camera

00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:44,560
audio recording media a lot of stuff

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:47,050
okay so there are things that still the

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:51,390
browser's don't have access to like NFC

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:54,880
but it's not a lot and we really can

00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:58,150
have a very very rich web application

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:02,260
running on the mobile and feeling like a

00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:04,290
native mobile application if you want to

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:07,840
hear more about the features of

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:11,610
progressive web applications about how

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:15,400
to do them build them the right way

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:20,320
which features to think about this guy

00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:25,810
Chris Hillman Hillman he gave a really

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,230
really great talk in a jazz Poland last

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:31,750
June and he really talks about all the

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:35,680
aspects of progressive web application

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:38,380
and it gives really really great points

00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:43,390
great ideas so I really recommend you

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:46,240
watching this talk ok so to go deeper

00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:49,750
this is the guy one of them there are

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:53,650
lots of great resources on the web for

00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:55,530
telling you best practices and so on so

00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:58,800
let's go

00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:01,190
to do some actions they have any

00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:10,560
questions so far

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:13,200
okay okay so how do we test if our web

00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,320
application is progressive enough there

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,990
are several tools but one of the most

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,560
popular is lighthouse

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,230
it is a tool developed by Google it was

00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,880
first available as a Chrome extension

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,060
but now it's actually built into Chrome

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,500
in the dev tools and if you don't want

00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,540
to use Chrome or don't want to use it

00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,710
through the dev tools then you can

00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:41,700
install it a via nkm or yarn or whatever

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:43,830
and use it through the command line so

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,400
we're going to use a lighthouse to test

00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:50,130
our application and our application is a

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:53,280
demo application which is a song book

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:55,950
and this is the icon and you can

00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:00,030
actually access it through this link

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:02,760
right now but now the deployed version

00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,830
is not progressive at all it's a very

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:10,080
basic version and I'll show you in a

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:12,870
moment so what I'm using to develop this

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:17,670
application so of course on the front

00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:20,100
end I'm using angular and this talk is

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:24,230
about angular and angular CLI and the

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:29,360
tools that they give you to help you

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:33,350
progress if I or your application - they

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,990
automatically give you the test your

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:41,450
application and they can build for

00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:45,930
example the service worker for you and

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:49,280
so we'll see how it's done there I'm

00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:53,220
using angular material for the

00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:56,640
components to have a nice look and feel

00:23:53,220 --> 00:24:01,170
for the application I'm not a designer

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,570
so this really helps me if I want to to

00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,700
quickly have an application that looks

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:10,630
well both on the

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:14,620
and the big screen and on the mobile and

00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:18,910
I'm using a library that actually comes

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:22,660
with what kind of comes with a angular

00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:26,110
material you install it together which

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:30,340
is called flex layout and I'll talk

00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:32,800
about it in a moment because there is a

00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:39,130
very important feature that flex layout

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:42,400
gives us I've also installed the package

00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,470
angular Service Worker which will with

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,240
the help of the angular CLI gives us the

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:50,230
serviceworker and we'll talk about this

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:54,540
in a few moments on the backend so I'm a

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:57,040
front-end developer I use serverless and

00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:59,260
write service applications but they're

00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,360
not really service you need the server

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:05,590
you need the database you need somewhere

00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:09,430
to deploy so I am using firebase and I

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:11,950
host the application that I use the

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:13,900
authentication specifically in this

00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:16,210
application I use the authentication

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,270
with Google and it's really just a few

00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:23,380
lines of code really minimal

00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:27,070
configuration to do this I'm using the

00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:31,000
database and we'll talk about the

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:32,770
database also we can use storage

00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,500
actually in this case I'm not using

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:41,920
using the storage but it gives you free

00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:45,220
storage for a4 files images and so on

00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:48,190
and am using cloud functions which is a

00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:53,640
relatively new feature it was announced

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:58,090
last March and it really gives you the

00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:01,120
the what what was really missing in in

00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:05,140
firebase until then giving you the

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,720
option to add some logic to the server

00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:09,490
side because there are some things that

00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,830
you don't want to do on the client

00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:15,610
because of security reasons because you

00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:18,550
have web developers who know how to open

00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:19,090
the the dev tools and change your code

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,999
right

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,039
so you do want to do stuff on the a

00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:27,009
server and it also allows you other

00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:32,289
things like sending notifications so you

00:26:27,009 --> 00:26:36,580
do this from the server and the cloud

00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:41,679
functions they have triggers so the the

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:43,629
functions run whenever there's a change

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,610
in the database when other and whenever

00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:54,070
a new user is registered to your web

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:57,220
application it has triggers connected to

00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:00,039
the storage whenever you upload an image

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:03,340
for example so it can take the image and

00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:05,409
process it using Google Cloud API so

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,590
there's also integration with Google

00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:11,470
Cloud and check whether the image is

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:14,409
appropriate or not and do something

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:15,970
about it to give you the result there's

00:27:14,409 --> 00:27:18,279
so much that you can do with cloud

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:23,230
functions and it really gives you the

00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:32,169
missing part in the server less a server

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:37,659
application okay any questions so far

00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:39,940
firebase by the way is it's it's a

00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:44,399
really good great platform that you can

00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:55,029
use and that the connection is already

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:58,480
secure it uses HTTP and HTTPS so it's

00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:00,309
free if your application is as small and

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,980
you don't have a lot of users but once

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:06,249
it starts to grow then you start to pay

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:09,429
but it also gives you the option to get

00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:12,789
revenue from your application for

00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:16,090
example to use Adwords so it's really

00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:17,919
something that if you if you don't have

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,350
a server sided then it's really

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:25,749
something you should start looking into

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:28,750
and it's not it well it's good for for

00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:32,130
demo applications like I do here but

00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:36,840
also real projects real

00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:41,929
big projects big companies use it for

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:45,870
their applications so check it out okay

00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:48,090
so this is the initial state I'm going

00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:51,419
to show you the application first and

00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:54,030
we'll run the lighthouse audit on it so

00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:58,440
this is the application

00:28:54,030 --> 00:29:02,250
it's a songbook and basically it just

00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:06,419
has a list of songs and it shows you the

00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:09,179
lyrics and to be able to add a song you

00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:11,250
need to sign in and right now the option

00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,260
with email and password does not work

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,740
and so you can sign and only with the

00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:18,929
Google

00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:21,419
yes I'm signing in and I need to choose

00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:26,630
some kind of one of my many Google

00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:29,280
accounts and then we can also add a song

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:38,309
so is there a song that you want to add

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:40,049
now something yeah what's that knocking

00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:46,679
on heaven's door we don't have it here

00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:50,760
no okay knocking on Oh what okay sorry

00:29:46,679 --> 00:30:03,690
forgot the key okay let's take the

00:29:50,760 --> 00:30:09,960
lyrics okay okay so I'm adding a song

00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:12,299
here and adding the lyrics oh yeah

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,320
that's the one and it's supposed to be

00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:16,710
saved

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:20,520
maybe Oh some of you already put test

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,830
songs here right okay so this app is not

00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:27,809
really perfect

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:30,419
um and the thing is I don't use the real

00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:34,400
time I've used a real time database but

00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:39,420
I access it with a Jason

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:41,820
API REST API that's because of the

00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:45,390
caching with the service a worker I'll

00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,640
explain this a bit later but so some

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:53,760
things are not updated immediately and

00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:57,330
that's maybe maybe will change it in

00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,780
later versions so the reason I decided

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:03,210
to write this application and to

00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:08,070
progressive Phi it is because a lot of

00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:10,680
times I go to trips in the in the wild

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:14,610
with friends and we stayed there at

00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:16,500
night we have a campfire and someone

00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:18,840
brings a guitar and we start singing

00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:23,730
songs right we're waiting for the food

00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,280
to be ready and we just we want to sing

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:27,930
some songs and of course we don't have a

00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,580
Wi-Fi connection and we don't have

00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,740
internet connection

00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:36,180
even ok so it's difficult to get the

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,940
data so we want some of the songs to be

00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:42,630
available offline so when you're online

00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:45,600
you can just save the songs that you

00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:48,450
want and when you're offline if you've

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:53,070
looked at the song the songs that you've

00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:55,590
been watching they are cached and you

00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:59,490
can open them offline so right now it

00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:04,710
will not work and let's perform an audit

00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:08,730
on this application so here in the dev

00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:13,950
tools I hope you can see I can also lip

00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:16,620
bigger okay so in the audit tab we have

00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:20,520
lighthouse perform an audit run audit

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:24,510
and let's see how not progressive our

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:27,420
web application is ok so it actually

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:33,720
runs the application as if it were on

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:36,150
mobile on low internet connection it

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,210
checks what happens if there's no

00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:43,110
connection at all if you're offline it

00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:47,780
measures performance it measures the

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:50,420
time until you get a the first

00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,430
the initial view of the application

00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,450
there are a lot of things that it

00:32:52,430 --> 00:33:06,400
measures okay so it takes a little bit

00:32:56,450 --> 00:33:10,760
of time and and in the meantime so okay

00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:13,820
so this was the result of a few weeks

00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:16,610
ago the result might change this might

00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:29,810
be something a bit different but let's

00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:34,970
see the results now takes time okay so

00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:38,990
let's talk about a the app shell in the

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:42,500
mean time and I'm sorry this is now

00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:44,630
going to be a little bit a going back

00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:48,200
and forth because of lighthouse so I

00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:49,730
hope you keep up with the presentation

00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:55,030
with with them what I'm talking about

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:58,640
and remembering what lighthouse was a

00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,750
was checking on which version we're on

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,170
okay

00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:08,780
so app shell is is giving you the

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:15,500
initial load of the application the HTML

00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:18,440
and CSS that a as long as the JavaScript

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:26,260
isn't loaded it isn't ready it can show

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:31,730
something to the user so let's see okay

00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:34,460
so we got 45 on progressive web app 67

00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,850
on performance accessibility and best

00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:43,070
practice is pretty high okay cool but if

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:46,100
we go to metrics then we see that the

00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:51,500
first meaningful paint is after almost

00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:54,650
five seconds okay so for for the first

00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,330
four seconds we have a blank page and

00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:59,390
this is horrible like the user doesn't

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,280
know what what's happening and only then

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:05,000
we have something showing

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,940
the the header and after five seconds we

00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,740
have the content so this is not really

00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:12,080
great and we want to fix it with the app

00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:14,180
shell so at least you have some kind of

00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,890
a spinner to have we can have the header

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,920
already because it's static we don't

00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:22,550
need any logic to have the header of the

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:28,130
application okay so actually this is

00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:31,730
something that you might use angular

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:36,500
tools like angular Universal to to build

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:39,350
to get a your app shell but you can also

00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:43,130
do this by us by ourselves so here I

00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:48,170
have a style for aim for a loader for a

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:54,280
spinner and I have the the spinner

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:56,780
itself so I'm going to a source

00:35:54,280 --> 00:36:10,640
index.html I'm going to add here the

00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:12,800
style I'm adding also so so as we wrote

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:18,410
I'm using here the prefix s bees for

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:23,540
songbook so when angular aim is ready

00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:26,000
and has all the logic and all the all

00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:30,140
the components that it needs then it

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,990
will show the content the the component

00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:35,210
itself dsb root but as long as angular

00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:38,360
is not ready the javascript is not ready

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:43,850
then it will show what's inside this

00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:46,940
element okay so if we put some regular

00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:51,640
HTML in this then this is the thing that

00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:57,350
we'll see okay we can see this offline

00:36:51,640 --> 00:37:02,630
and you serve in the localhost not not

00:36:57,350 --> 00:37:09,070
really offline and we're also going to

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:13,270
build this and deploy and test it with

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,270
with the lighthouse again

00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,910
okay okay let's open the localhost oh

00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,000
you'll see

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:27,670
what I'm adding here here's the spinner

00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:33,200
and you already have also the header oh

00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:38,690
no it was too fast okay so I'm going to

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:44,720
deploy it so let's start stop this

00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:48,860
so first ng build for production okay

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:53,300
so this will build our whole application

00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:56,930
and we'll put it in the dist folder now

00:37:53,300 --> 00:38:04,070
I already have firebase tools installed

00:37:56,930 --> 00:38:07,700
here and I use it a here I have firebase

00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:10,180
that jason telling me what alpha the

00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:14,320
firebase tools work in this application

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:20,780
so I'm using the database rules I'm

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:25,520
using the hosting and and I'm also using

00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:28,270
a cloud functions here so you you see I

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,450
have an inner mini project of functions

00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,660
okay

00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:34,340
so I built the application and it's

00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:38,210
supposed to be here in this and we can

00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:45,680
see that in index.html it has now all

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:49,870
the style and and what I added inside

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:58,040
the root element so I just do firebase

00:38:49,870 --> 00:39:00,680
deploy deploy a only hosting because I

00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:04,310
didn't change anything in the functions

00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,770
or in the database rules and so in just

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:08,960
a few moments it will deploy and you'll

00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:10,700
be able to already see the new version

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,970
so you'll have to if you if you're

00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:16,910
watching it on your mobile application

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:20,240
then you'll have to refresh so we'll

00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:23,040
also refresh it here and to do empty

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:30,240
cache and hard without it's

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:32,670
open open it again audits and perform an

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,040
audit okay let's see if anything has

00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:43,430
changed okay we have the spinner let

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:47,790
give it the time it needs to run okay so

00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:50,520
so this is the state that we want to

00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:56,400
reach to have an initial load very

00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:59,820
quickly first meaningful paint and in

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,670
the meantime a while a lighthouse is

00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:09,710
working I'm going to talk about flex

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:12,840
layout and I promise from before okay so

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:15,570
let me open this application in a new

00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:19,410
tab and show you something okay

00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:22,080
so we have this song the list of the

00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:25,290
songs and when you open it on a large

00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,780
screen then it is initially opened and

00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:32,150
you can minimize it you can like close

00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:35,130
this menu in the sidebar but if you're a

00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:38,850
if you have it on mobile phone now we

00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:41,960
have to refresh to do this then the

00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:45,990
initial view is with the side nav a

00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:51,720
closed and with an option of course to

00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:56,870
open it and to select a song so this

00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:59,370
side now is is a feature that comes with

00:40:56,870 --> 00:41:04,430
it's one of the components it comes with

00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:09,540
angular material and I'm using it here

00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:11,850
song a song book song some book

00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:16,100
component okay

00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:16,100
yeah here it is the

00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:24,880
I know no sorry

00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:30,130
yeah okay this is the angular material

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:33,190
side now and it gets a flag whether it

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:37,360
starts opened or closed and it gets also

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:40,210
a mode of weather when it's opened

00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:42,010
whether there's a backdrop whether the

00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:46,440
contents it's pushed to the side or the

00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:48,880
side nav is opened over the content and

00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:54,250
because we're using angular then I can

00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:57,240
bind my variables to it so I'm using

00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:01,510
binding here for opened and for mode but

00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:05,560
we're using heat here in the JavaScript

00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:07,870
part nothing the CSS if it was in

00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,050
something in the style and CSS what

00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:15,940
would we use to to change the style in

00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:18,700
different views we would use media

00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,280
queries right if it's a small screen do

00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:27,280
this if it's a large screen do that but

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:31,990
here we can't do this so I'm using flex

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:35,410
layout and specifically observable media

00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:41,110
so flex layout is a whole every detail

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:43,870
it gives us flex box a features that we

00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:48,250
can use in our templates so everything

00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:50,740
you know from flex box it it gives us

00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:53,710
directives to use them directly from the

00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:56,410
template in angular but the observable

00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:59,230
media gives us a feature that we that

00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:04,780
just tells us what kind of screen the

00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:12,850
user uses so we of course injected here

00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:15,310
and on init week we asked it whether the

00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:19,330
screen is extra small if it is extra

00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:22,210
small then we want to start with a list

00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:25,390
close so list open is false and the sine

00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:29,170
of mode will be push and if it's open if

00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:30,520
it's if the screen is large a like

00:43:29,170 --> 00:43:33,160
larger than extra

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,400
then it will start with a list open and

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,070
the sign of mode will be side so this is

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,480
really really powerful to use in angular

00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:47,170
applications because a material design

00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:51,730
needs it in in this part of the

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:55,090
application and not the CSS okay so

00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:57,370
let's see what lighthouse gave us okay

00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:01,870
so remember we had 45 on progressive web

00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:06,090
app so we have now an improvement of 10

00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:06,090
points so that's really awesome

00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:14,890
let's see the metrics so in one second

00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:19,000
we already have some kind of a view for

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:21,730
the user still lighthouse doesn't call

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,950
it a first meaningful paint it still

00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:26,740
recognizes that the meaningful paint

00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:29,890
comes after we have some data but that's

00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:33,960
ok at least we can see something we can

00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:39,990
see that the application is working ok

00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:45,700
so let's go on so this was flex layout

00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:47,740
okay now this is also something that is

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,020
relevant to all web applications not

00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,080
only to angular applications the app

00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:57,940
manifest so if you just add this

00:44:53,080 --> 00:45:00,070
manifest manifest dot JSON well with

00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:04,630
some configuration and you can give it

00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:07,030
the icon that way that will be used if

00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:10,180
the user is installs the application it

00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:12,430
will give also the option to install the

00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:17,410
application on the mobile or on the

00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:21,720
computer even and it will also give the

00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:25,180
look and feel of the browser so the

00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,000
browser itself can get the colors that

00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,400
you choose for your application so

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,540
that's really cool now guess what color

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,540
is my favorite

00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:45,730
all right so so let's do this and then

00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:46,900
we're gonna that's a spoiler and while

00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:50,230
we're auditing it

00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,680
we'll also talk about the manifest

00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:56,890
itself

00:45:50,680 --> 00:46:04,170
so let's first add it so in a in source

00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:11,950
I'm adding a new file manifest dot Jason

00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:13,450
ok salida to get all right now I have

00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:19,079
the content here

00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:24,960
scratch one of the scratches no scratch

00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:32,559
seven no sorry

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:35,079
okay this is the one okay so it's a very

00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:37,809
simple Jason where you basically add

00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:41,740
colors and icons and some description

00:46:37,809 --> 00:46:46,349
about your application so I'm just going

00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:49,900
to copy what I already did there also

00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:52,299
well you can find it on the on the web

00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:55,660
some examples for how to build this

00:46:52,299 --> 00:47:00,730
manifest really really simple where is

00:46:55,660 --> 00:47:05,200
my manifest file here it is okay so I

00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:07,529
have this and it tells me that oh it's

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,500
okay

00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:16,569
and I have to add it to it you angular

00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:19,059
CLI Jason to the assets so that when we

00:47:16,569 --> 00:47:25,240
build the application it will also take

00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:30,779
this file man if other other resorts and

00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,779
faster Jason okay let's build it

00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:40,750
and let's see just a little bit what we

00:47:34,870 --> 00:47:43,030
have in this manifest okay so for

00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:45,370
example we have the direction left to

00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,810
right you can also say right to left the

00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:48,810
language the name of the application

00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:54,880
theme color which is purple of course of

00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,810
background color that's when the

00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:02,440
application starts when you install it

00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:07,870
then the the view it will give you the

00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:15,070
icon and with a background color let's

00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:19,030
deploy it to firebase and you need to

00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:22,120
give it a list of icons oh I hope that I

00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:24,070
added yeah there are all in in assets so

00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:29,650
it's okay it's already added in the

00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:38,460
angular CLI let us reload the

00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:41,860
application and add it now form an audit

00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:48,850
okay another thing that you can see

00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:56,770
actually if you if you open the dev

00:48:48,850 --> 00:48:58,900
tools you can go to application and see

00:48:56,770 --> 00:49:04,300
whether there is a manifest or not so no

00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:09,960
manifest what it's not deployed yet now

00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:09,960
it is so I need to do this again

00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,140
okay it's supposed to I hope it's there

00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:23,660
oh no no no I forgot to do something

00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:29,540
very very important sorry I forgot to

00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:35,690
add it to to call it in the HTML in the

00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:37,090
index.html so I'll need to build it

00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:42,230
depend again

00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:47,540
so again index.html we go somewhere here

00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:51,500
in the head let's do this here okay so

00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:55,130
this actually gets the manifest loads

00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:58,900
the manifest for us and also gives a

00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:01,310
theme color if you're using the browser

00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:06,860
so sorry we have to do this again

00:50:01,310 --> 00:50:09,890
I always forget this little part but but

00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:14,590
then when I try to show that there is a

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:22,100
manifest then that's the way that oh

00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:25,730
that's what I forgot okay let's go back

00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:28,010
to the manifest in the meantime so you

00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:30,260
need different icons for different sizes

00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:37,340
for all the devices that you're going to

00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:39,950
use and there are of course a services

00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:44,750
on the web free services that you give

00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:50,240
them an icon your own little picture

00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:55,420
that you that you did and a and then

00:50:50,240 --> 00:51:03,410
it's let's run the audit again sorry and

00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:07,420
then I want to do hard reload and and

00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:09,740
then it generates the whole all the

00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,320
different icons that it need that you

00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:16,310
need

00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:20,810
okay performance no a oh here it is okay

00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:23,000
so we have a manifest and it gives you

00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:24,059
the start URLs theme color background

00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,630
color and

00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:29,699
okay here are the icons all the list of

00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:32,699
icons that I have here okay so I only

00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:35,549
had to draw this once and I use the

00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:39,930
website to to generate all the icons

00:51:35,549 --> 00:51:45,150
okay let's see it's taking time of

00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:49,019
course trimming trace oh sure okay yeah

00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:51,329
what was the score before 55 right okay

00:51:49,019 --> 00:51:57,839
hopefully it will be increased a little

00:51:51,329 --> 00:51:58,259
bit okay you see that it's doing a lot

00:51:57,839 --> 00:52:03,930
of things

00:51:58,259 --> 00:52:10,829
oh yeah okay we need to do a few more

00:52:03,930 --> 00:52:12,660
things before we can finish okay let's

00:52:10,829 --> 00:52:14,699
see the next step will be adding a

00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:19,619
service worker so I'll talk about

00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:22,079
service worker in the mean time so

00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:26,609
service worker is also a new feature

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:30,569
that is implemented in browsers now I

00:52:26,609 --> 00:52:34,170
have to say a word about browsers an

00:52:30,569 --> 00:52:36,449
apple they didn't really care about

00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:39,869
progressive web applications until very

00:52:36,449 --> 00:52:45,989
recently about two months ago they they

00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:47,969
gave in they said that they're going to

00:52:45,989 --> 00:52:50,579
support progressive web applications and

00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:52,559
they're going to give the ability to

00:52:50,579 --> 00:52:55,429
write to use service workers in the

00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:58,079
applications and all the other features

00:52:55,429 --> 00:52:59,549
because they realize that everybody

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,099
wants to use them everybody wants to

00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:08,189
write progressive web applications okay

00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:16,910
so let us see the okay 73 now pretty

00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:21,779
good okay so um the Service Worker is is

00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:26,249
a file a JavaScript file that runs in

00:53:21,779 --> 00:53:29,759
the background and it kind of it it is a

00:53:26,249 --> 00:53:32,519
proxy between your application and a

00:53:29,759 --> 00:53:35,460
server and the the Internet

00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:39,240
okay so you can cache data

00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:41,610
there and it also works offline

00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:44,640
and it even works when the browser is

00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:47,180
actually closed okay so it runs in the

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:55,080
background whenever your phone or your

00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:59,220
your computer is is on so the way we do

00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:03,890
this with angular in angular CLI we

00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:13,310
adhere to our app we tell it to use a

00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:19,530
service worker so worker true okay and

00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:22,350
this will already build a very minimal

00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:26,280
service worker which goes through our

00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:28,530
application and checks all the assets

00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:33,960
the aesthetic assets that we are using

00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:37,950
and it tells like the service worker and

00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:40,730
knows how to catch them and we're using

00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:44,700
because the service workers can be

00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:48,860
really really really large files we're

00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:53,490
using here a service worker manifest

00:54:48,860 --> 00:55:00,930
which which tells angular the the

00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:04,680
service worker a library in angular it

00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:08,940
tells it how to build the actual service

00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:13,920
worker so this is the angular service

00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:16,380
worker that is created so it has the

00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,530
static URLs of the everything that we're

00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:21,810
using so we have material icons

00:55:19,530 --> 00:55:24,420
polyfills my and all the app icons that

00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:29,130
we've added all these can be cached now

00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:32,070
in the service worker and the service

00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:34,500
worker itself this is the file worker

00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:39,000
basic which is a really really long file

00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:43,140
ok now we want to add some capabilities

00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:45,510
to the service worker we want to a to

00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:48,260
cache also

00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:53,250
[Music]

00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:56,730
we want to cache dynamic assets and we

00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:59,340
also need to tell it a what are our

00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:07,410
routes because it may catch the

00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:10,380
index.html but um but it doesn't know

00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:12,330
that when we're out because it's a it's

00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:14,220
a single page application it doesn't

00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:17,820
realize that all the routes are supposed

00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:22,140
to go to index.html okay so I'm creating

00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:25,890
a new file in the root of the

00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:29,070
application and supposed to have here

00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:38,040
another scratch file for this yeah

00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:39,650
so in this Jason let me just a build it

00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:43,530
again in the meantime

00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:46,710
so in this JSON file I'm telling it what

00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:49,560
routes we have and there will also be a

00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:53,400
angular tools that will go over your

00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:55,320
application and identify the routes by

00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:57,330
itself so right now I'm doing this

00:56:55,320 --> 00:57:01,050
manually but you will be able to do this

00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:03,630
automatically with the tools it I'm

00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:07,410
telling it what dynamic assets I'm using

00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:09,420
so here comes the the reason why I'm not

00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:11,520
using the real-time database in firebase

00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:14,580
because when you use WebSockets then it

00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:21,210
doesn't go through the the service

00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:27,690
worker so just to show that it works I'm

00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:30,359
using here the rest API is regular REST

00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:34,320
API but if you want to use the the

00:57:30,359 --> 00:57:37,200
real-time database then just either use

00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:42,570
index DB instead of the Service Worker

00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:46,380
to cache the data or use the new feature

00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:48,660
that they have the new the new database

00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,830
which is called firestore which already

00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:55,160
has these capabilities built in okay so

00:57:51,830 --> 00:57:57,930
right now if I'm not refreshing this and

00:57:55,160 --> 00:58:00,599
we were looking at knockin on heaven's

00:57:57,930 --> 00:58:03,510
and I'm gonna turn out turn off the

00:58:00,599 --> 00:58:06,300
Wi-Fi for a moment and I'll go to some

00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:09,690
other song it will it will not slow a

00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:12,839
load and we were knocking on heaven's

00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:15,660
door and it doesn't load right but if

00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:22,770
I'm turning it right back on and I'll

00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:25,710
refresh the application now then it's

00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:27,660
supposed to also work offline okay so

00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,670
we're in knocking on heaven's door let's

00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:33,109
also go to dust in the wind and heal the

00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:36,059
world let's turn off the Wi-Fi

00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:36,809
hey let's go somewhere else ritual and

00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:39,059
sanity

00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:43,589
didn't catch it we weren't there but

00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:49,020
heal the world oh man come on did I do

00:58:43,589 --> 00:58:55,890
it right let's see sorry

00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:59,880
oh yeah so uh so angular CLI gives it a

00:58:55,890 --> 00:59:02,790
reference it in index.html it calls here

00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:07,460
the Service Worker register so it was

00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:14,700
supposed to be there okay maybe I didn't

00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:18,480
reload it okay I guess it just didn't

00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:21,030
reload correctly okay again empty cache

00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:26,900
okay we'll just run the audit on it in

00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:32,309
the meantime and hopefully it was okay

00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:35,730
let's check it here is where is that

00:59:32,309 --> 00:59:40,430
what mm-hmm

00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:46,079
what what did I do okay cancel cancel

00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:48,270
again run out it okay it's running oh I

00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:52,079
can't turn the Wi-Fi off because our

00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:59,430
audit audit will be ruined what what

00:59:52,079 --> 01:00:02,250
happened here let's do this again okay

00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:16,890
this is supposed to be the last step

01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:18,780
come on don't fail me now okay so so

01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:21,660
like I said once you put serviceworker

01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:25,859
true in the angular CLI when it builds

01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:28,140
it adds the serviceworker registration

01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:33,150
file you can see also that all the files

01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:35,640
have now their hash in their name so the

01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:38,490
serviceworker also works this way if a

01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:40,460
file is changed then the hash is changed

01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:43,770
and that's how you know whether the

01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:49,730
whether it needs to reload it or it can

01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:54,809
use it from the cache what else okay um

01:00:49,730 --> 01:00:57,869
when you cache the dynamic resources

01:00:54,809 --> 01:00:59,760
then you have configuration for a

01:00:57,869 --> 01:01:02,160
optimisation for freshness or

01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:05,609
performance whether to always look for

01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:09,420
the new file or or take from the cache

01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:13,730
first a max entry is max age when the

01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:19,640
when the data will become stale strategy

01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:24,089
for example here it's least least

01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:28,740
recently used there's also an option to

01:01:24,089 --> 01:01:31,859
cash a outside resources for example

01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:35,880
icons or fonts but I didn't use it here

01:01:31,859 --> 01:01:36,299
so it takes this JSON that I that I've

01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:40,290
written

01:01:36,299 --> 01:01:44,970
it adds it to the adjacent to the

01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:47,020
software a serviceworker manifest that

01:01:44,970 --> 01:01:52,120
it builds by itself

01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:55,360
okay so it has also the static URLs here

01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:58,300
and it builds a serviceworker and added

01:01:55,360 --> 01:02:01,480
to index.html now it might be better

01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:03,970
practice to load the serviceworker not

01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:06,880
in index.html but in your angular

01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,800
application after you bootstrap your

01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,020
application because bootstrapping your

01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:14,050
application and I want to show you this

01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:18,730
is really really quickly where the

01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:22,420
source a in the main TS when you do this

01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:25,360
bootstrap module it actually returns a

01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:30,490
promise and then it's it's best to load

01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:35,950
the serviceworker okay let's see oh my

01:02:30,490 --> 01:02:38,170
god okay we have a hundred and

01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:40,900
progressive web applications we have a

01:02:38,170 --> 01:02:42,550
hundred on best practices there's still

01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:46,360
some things to do with performance and

01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:52,140
accessibility and now a few notes just I

01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:52,140
know that him it's best my hour already

01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:59,290
okay so we had really really boosting in

01:02:56,590 --> 01:03:03,640
the progressiveness of our application

01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:06,840
so we talked about most of these

01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:09,070
features we didn't really talk about

01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:11,650
notifications but one thing that I want

01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:13,780
you two to know well two things first of

01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:16,240
all the notifications also work through

01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:19,030
the serviceworker so you can use it for

01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:21,370
that but really try to think about your

01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:24,550
users this is a screenshot of my mobile

01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:29,560
a at one day that it just didn't have

01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:33,490
time to open or the Twitter and it has

01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:35,320
37 more than 37 notifications only from

01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:37,030
Twitter and I don't know what to do with

01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,640
it like I have to go one by one because

01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:42,480
I don't want to miss anything so please

01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:45,100
think about your users when you do this

01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:48,640
more in progressive webs in a
