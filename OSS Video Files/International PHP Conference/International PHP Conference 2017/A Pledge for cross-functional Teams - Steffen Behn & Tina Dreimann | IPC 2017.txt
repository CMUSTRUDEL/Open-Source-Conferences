Title: A Pledge for cross-functional Teams - Steffen Behn & Tina Dreimann | IPC 2017
Publication date: 2019-01-23
Playlist: International PHP Conference 2017
Description: 
	Steffen Behn (die kartenmacherei) and Tina Dreimann (die kartenmacherei) at IPC 2017: One year ago, we were still happy to have scrum tech teams shielded from the rest of the organisation. Product managers were our gatekeepers for outside stakeholders. Our developers were even based in another office. Twelve months later we have changed the setup completely. Strongly inspired by the Spotify model, we transformed the structure of our product company into a network of fully cross-functional and self-organized teams. Discover why we took such a drastic step, what worked and what did not work â€“ unfiltered and raw.

00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:15,020
good morning everybody how are you great

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,960
to see you and before we start with our

00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,580
refreshening good morning talk I just

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,380
want to show you a little detail you

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,320
might wonder why there is a link above

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,840
the presentation that's a link you can

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,960
use to already post questions during our

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,600
session so we don't lose any thoughts

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,149
and afterwards we can like them

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,920
prioritize them and also hopefully

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:43,110
answer all of them and with some

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,160
pressing really hard also just shoot it

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:49,940
out don't worry and you do have the veal

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,510
on you have your iPhone so it I'm sure

00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:56,219
it will work well and before we start

00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:59,820
with the talk a quick introduction to

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:04,409
ourselves this is Stefan Stefan vane our

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:06,420
CTO and formerly a product manager BMW

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,409
and still the petrol head on the

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:15,299
weekends it was a long time ago in his

00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:17,700
early days or the old days I'm Tina

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,970
diamond I'm business and agile coach at

00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,460
the CAD Mahara and in my old days I was

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,250
a management consultant and luckily I

00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,979
switched to e-commerce quite a while ago

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:31,290
and got to know all the coolest stuff

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,290
like agile and lean and design thinking

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,229
and we're really happy that there's

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,659
already such a really big crowd today

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,400
for this talk we're happy you're here

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,189
and we're also really glad that you

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:50,479
didn't leave the room when you saw this

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,479
slide and you made it

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,939
more than 2 years ago and I think I

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,689
really think you're a really smart guy

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,880
and there's a lot of good stuff in this

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,119
process and the fun thing is that behind

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,799
the red boxes there even more processes

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,830
hidden there was a process for

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:15,170
everything basically exactly and

00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:21,810
but the the good news that already then

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:24,900
we were working in agile teams we did

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,599
have for example a full prioritized

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:31,319
backlog and we had small EDI developer

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,209
teams with product owners so we thought

00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,470
hey we're doing scrum we working agile

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:39,510
we're fantastic we did scrum I mean

00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,280
quite close to to the scrum back

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,519
practice best practice I would we did

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,650
exactly but our product owners where the

00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,170
gun does in the organization and they

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:54,870
were standing there saying you shall not

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:56,760
pass before every two or four weeks

00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,890
you're sitting in a big prioritization

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,319
meetings with ten other people's and you

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,890
have to fight on the totally wrong level

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:08,489
on what is the next topic in the backlog

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,530
and then going to the developers and the

00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:12,660
developers were really lucky they were

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,790
shielded so they could really focus well

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,549
had small teams they could choose their

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:29,609
own names before example had unicorns I

00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:31,889
want him but surprisingly it failed this

00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:35,849
really complex process failed and we had

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:41,910
two learnings from that don't throw a

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:45,440
process at it and really important to us

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:48,569
is that you shouldn't escalate decisions

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:52,919
just because they are difficult within a

00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:55,620
team and shielding really smart people

00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:59,940
our developers from decisions that

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,690
affect them is I can't put it on you any

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:07,889
other way

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:11,130
plain stupid and this is why we are here

00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:14,760
today firstly to to really convince you

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:20,000
that there is an agile and agile and

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:22,349
that this agile agile is much more

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,710
motivating and cool than than the old

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,440
edger we

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:29,110
and secondly also to to encourage

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,720
everybody if you're not doing it it yet

00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:35,280
to to experiment in other ways of

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,289
working in new ways of team setups

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:44,770
really with more autonomy smaller teams

00:04:38,289 --> 00:04:47,470
with a purpose and I hand over to you

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,389
yeah I will give you a quick quick

00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:50,889
overview of what what we do actually at

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:54,160
Kappa high don't worry it will be just

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:57,009
three sentences hopefully so we do cards

00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,400
Kappa high stands for card maker e if

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,710
you want to we do cards we don't do

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,710
Google Maps like cards we do printed

00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:08,080
cards greeting cards personals mint

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:14,440
cards wedding invitations etc really

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:17,229
sexy and we are right now something

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,759
around 130 people 3 offices across

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:23,889
Germany Munich and Hamburg mainly and

00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:25,840
there's one important fact which which I

00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,820
want to go a little into into detail

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,340
because it determined a lot of things

00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,010
about how we develop things and how we

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,990
do product management we call it that we

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,909
have like a symbiosis of hardware and

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,430
software yes it's not a cool hardware a

00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:41,260
phone thingy or something but it's a

00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:44,710
product right it's an actual product

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:46,900
which is somehow created in terms of

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,490
product management graphics etc also

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,500
needs to be launched and there is

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,690
production and then there's the digital

00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,610
product because we are on our own and

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,400
the only sales channel we have so our

00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,949
online store is the only place so there

00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,930
was always a big fight like who is

00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:03,580
actually the front-runner in terms of

00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,199
innovation is that the product manager

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,210
print how we called it or is it a

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,210
product owner slash product manager

00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,830
digital and we never really figured it

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,720
out and we were looking in the past we

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,550
were looking for this unicorn who knows

00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,530
bows and it's almost not available

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,080
because the print guys don't know how to

00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:25,900
talk to tech people and vice versa so

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:29,560
that was always an issue yeah and let

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,120
let me beam back now however this

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,490
picture was taken

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,190
more than one year ago and

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:40,880
we were at that time we were roughly 90

00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:43,670
employees and I was still head of shop

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,510
management and in and international so

00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:51,910
at two things at the same time and it

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:55,640
was a very painful time for me because

00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:58,820
the good part was over we had managed a

00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,000
major relaunch in-house we redesigned

00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:05,690
our brand and did a responsive front-end

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,820
and we always thought that's the

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,410
scapegoat because we are slow we are

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,550
slow because we in the relaunch phase

00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,860
then suddenly we were done it was

00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:19,010
launched but we didn't get any faster

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,960
and it was really frustrating because in

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,360
my shop management team I did have

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,030
quarterly goals and I really like to set

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,110
my own goals but honestly the the the

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,450
things that we put down there couldn't

00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,610
be fulfilled by the team because within

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,090
the team there was only the silo and the

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:41,210
shop management and I had to realign

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:44,030
with other teams with head ops and we

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:45,950
had 13 functions at that time so at

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,770
least had to align with five other

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:52,250
people to ensure the priorities were all

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:54,440
in the right order and usually they

00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:56,150
weren't and you always had to escalate

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,280
go to the founder kiss stuff and say

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:04,250
please tell everybody we have to do this

00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:06,290
because really we don't manage and good

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,670
thing is that I wasn't the only one in

00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,890
pain and many people started talking to

00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:15,170
to the leadership team so this is an

00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:18,050
actual quote and we translated it Anna

00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:21,080
said it in German but Anna is one of our

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,360
most dearest employees she's working

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,070
with us since 2011 she started a couple

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,070
of months before me she was the third

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:32,090
employee in the Attic yes the ethic of

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:34,790
my brother's house and I mean she went

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,430
through several development phases but

00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,020
in last year she there was an actual

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:41,540
quote she came to my brother and me and

00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,150
she said what the I really want to

00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,650
be as fast and have as much fun as I had

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,380
in the old days and what she meant was

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,180
that is basically

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,870
we were small when we were four or five

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:54,730
people we had no Jireh no nothing and

00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,980
you just talked with each other and you

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,600
simply said okay this is really the most

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,310
highest priority right now let's get

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,950
this out of the way there was one

00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,930
external developer an agency and he was

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,790
working full-time for us and it was

00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:12,640
really easy there was no communication

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:14,800
overhead so ana was luckily not the only

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,070
one who felt the pain it was us as well

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,410
and we thought about it and with we

00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,140
talked a lot about what actual problems

00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,930
we have and I want to run through them a

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,330
little with you so first of all

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,950
prioritization right if you have we had

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:32,710
at that time Tina already mentioned it

00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,140
we had three individual development

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:37,690
teams all in their way cross-functional

00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,030
meaning like perfect scrum setup product

00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:42,700
on back and front end and they basically

00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:44,950
were able to work on esday wish on their

00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:47,590
backlog their backlog was externally

00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,830
determined but they were able to work on

00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:51,610
their backlog and but they couldn't

00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,050
prepare for it

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,640
they couldn't prepare for it because

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,560
basically there was a bigger backlog

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,390
yeah there was a bigger backlog which

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,550
was then determined by some kind of

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:02,170
priority meeting and it was really

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:03,700
painful because nobody was able to

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:05,800
decide what is actually the highest

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,810
priority and it always ended up with

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,330
them saying Christophe Stephane you have

00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,250
to take a decision and we actually

00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:14,260
didn't know the details anymore so we

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,700
had to take decisions of which we didn't

00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,250
know the details so you take bad

00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,580
decisions all the time and that was

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:24,760
really frustrating secondly for me the

00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,470
most painful part was we're taking every

00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,210
three months we're taking an employee

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,300
survey and we basically ask a simple

00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,190
question how likely would you recommend

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,650
us as a company to your friends and

00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:39,090
family and you can answer in the scale

00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:41,680
from zero to ten and what we saw that

00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,890
the longer people stay with us the less

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,310
likely they were

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,960
suppose we're likely to recommend us and

00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:51,250
that's really frustrating and if you if

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,900
you have a company and you see that

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,940
you're like those should be the

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,590
most loyal people they are staying with

00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,960
you since five years why aren't they

00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:01,240
happy and we talked to people and people

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,890
tell you it's normal you have to accept

00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,380
that people are very motivated at the

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:06,220
beginning but they it settles in it gets

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,530
boring

00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,540
it's get frustrating especially if you

00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:12,870
grow and we said that that can't be

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,870
ended

00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:20,530
we had Tina already mentioned it we were

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,480
in a phase where we were growing over

00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,060
all the years before in between hundred

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,670
and sixty percent and we were slowing

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:30,130
down obviously because we were at that

00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,990
time since two years market leader in

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,120
Europe so it's not that easy to grow

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,500
anymore if you're already on top but we

00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,390
still wouldn't didn't want to accept

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,560
that because we had so many ideas but we

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:44,290
couldn't get them on the road and also

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,590
to add that it's a usual size that when

00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:48,610
you're getting above 70 employees that's

00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:51,310
the time where you really have to

00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:52,300
rethink changing something completely

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,140
right

00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:58,810
and one important fact was also for us

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:01,150
we work in a seasonal business so yeah

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,920
we want to work a July etc but in the

00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:04,750
end Christmas is always at the same time

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,610
in the year and if you want to get out

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:08,200
things in before Christmas then you have

00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,240
to launch them before otherwise you

00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,250
won't have any impact and the same goes

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,960
for wedding even birthday is seasonally

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,390
you won't really you won't believe it

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,700
but people have their celebrations in

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,920
the summer so they send invitations for

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,990
the big parties in the summer but like

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:28,570
headless chickens everybody runs to this

00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:30,280
side now oh we missed it we were all run

00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,140
to the other side and then we run there

00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,890
oh and we missed the little season from

00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:39,790
Communion yeah so it it was just not

00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:42,070
good yeah and what was our answer we

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,860
reorganized teams we reorganized

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,900
everything or if every two months we

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:48,280
reorganized something and it never had

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,200
any traction

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,490
it just didn't change there was always

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,830
the same stupid discussions of different

00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:01,180
separated silos right

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:04,959
so then came this moment when I came to

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:08,410
us and that evening we had some wine and

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,470
we decided no more and we already had

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,329
started a time where we were already

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:14,649
reading a couple of different books and

00:13:13,329 --> 00:13:16,540
tried to figure out if there are

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:18,570
companies out there who had the same

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,940
problem and surprisingly there were--

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:23,620
and we did a small road trip we went

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,470
around Germany visited a couple of

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,290
companies who were already who had

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:32,200
already changed the way they work and we

00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:34,269
read a couple of books and we at that

00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,300
point we decided we want to actually fix

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:39,100
three things so first of all we want we

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,959
want really sustainable motivation with

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:42,910
the team and at that time we thought we

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,550
still had to motivate nowadays we know

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,260
we just cannot be motivate and that's

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:50,399
already enough people are motivated by

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,600
themselves secondly we wanted

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,370
prioritization doing the right way

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,220
meaning the people who know and the

00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:59,470
people who have that conflict should

00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,950
decide what is the highest priority the

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,540
people who actually know the details and

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:06,490
then again we wanted to become smaller

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,760
without firing people so we wanted to

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:13,660
become smaller in parts more separated

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,990
more more more autonomous and that only

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,930
works in a small team so to startups

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:24,010
back to startups but with out all the

00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:26,620
disadvantages startup and we actually

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:29,589
set up with one book which is really

00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:32,050
easy to comprehend it's not like not

00:14:29,589 --> 00:14:34,180
like a tough reader and it's from Daniel

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,240
pink and it's called Drive what really

00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:40,149
motivates us and he gives a a couple of

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,790
interesting TED talks about motivation

00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:43,660
and it really can recommend that and

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,709
basically he says there are three

00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,980
pillars which you have to achieve

00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:51,459
purpose mastery and autonomy for people

00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,019
to be motivated and purpose I think is

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,420
the word of the last couple of years

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,920
everybody knows what it is mastery it's

00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,470
not so much so that's really about

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,050
getting yourself better at something you

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:04,690
do every day and it's basically the

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:06,130
inherent things of developers so every

00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,510
developer you asked why you are

00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,060
developer in the second or third

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:10,880
sentence latest comes because I can keep

00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:15,440
on innovating

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:17,240
self-right and it's not just mastery for

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,900
yourself but it's also for your team and

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,790
then autonomy yeah I mean we don't

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,620
really love the word autonomy anymore

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,050
because it has a lot of misunderstanding

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,780
nowadays we would rather call it self

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:33,340
governing self organizing and especially

00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:37,790
in Hamburg autonomy has has a very bad

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,690
meaning since a couple of months and

00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:43,130
yeah

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:44,900
so our goal was and we we figured after

00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,910
reading the book after talking to those

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:50,000
companies that the only way you can

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:55,010
achieve those things is by having small

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:58,010
autonomous cross-functional teams and I

00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,080
mean we were still conservative in our

00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,930
thinking so we had a company of 90

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,540
people we were financially successful so

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,460
why would you just throw it all away and

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:10,430
do something completely new so we were

00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,980
rather a little careful and started to

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,540
do some experiment and the experiment

00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,790
which is most interesting for you guys

00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,680
probably is like every shop like every

00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,770
producing company we have Reclamation's

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,470
people complain about things going wrong

00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:27,080
and at that time we had something like

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:30,110
0.6 percent and still that was too high

00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:32,030
for us we wanted to reduce it and all

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:34,190
the efforts we did try before ended up

00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,330
in the same priority discussions etc and

00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:36,800
like now it's the fault of the

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:39,530
developers no it's the fault of the

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,160
service team know anybody else fault but

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:45,710
mine and so we didn't a small experiment

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:47,540
in two days to developers to service

00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:49,970
people one product manager and they went

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,980
together to our printing partner put

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:55,640
themselves into a room and they had no

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,960
external prioritization guiding nothing

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,730
they were just there to solve the

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,570
problem and they went out and solved it

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:05,060
by reducing it by 50% in two days so

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:12,260
down to 0.3 and that was something for

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:16,189
us was like crazy and after doing

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:19,310
several experiments we decided that we

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:22,040
really want to change the entire product

00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:23,709
organization there was about 50 people

00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:28,480
at that time

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:30,490
from the entire set and we did do one

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,130
thing we got inspiration from the

00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:37,210
Spotify model so we are working in

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:39,370
squats and chapters nowadays playing

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:43,510
business talk in a matrix organization

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:46,419
but our way of doing is a little bit

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:49,480
different from Spotify because we

00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:53,139
decided that in our cross-functional

00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,940
teams meaning in the cross-functional

00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:59,350
teams that include product manager

00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,690
developers there is no product owner

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:04,510
there's no lead because we had the

00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:09,070
difference we have three business parts

00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,840
that are that meet all the others we

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,539
wanted to make sure they figure it out

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,820
without just tuned we know that the

00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:18,039
product owner is not a classically

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,769
hierarchical position but let's face it

00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:23,080
most product owner positions I to some

00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:24,789
extent lift in that way that I mean if

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,559
they set the backlog priority

00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:29,019
they somehow decide on what the team is

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,760
doing they can do that good and talking

00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:32,950
to the team and figuring out what should

00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,220
be done they can also really be really

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:40,330
bad I've seen it and all the decisions I

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:42,549
just put to them so it's it's it's again

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:45,549
another another bottleneck so we wanted

00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:47,049
to try it out without and something else

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,010
we did do a little bit differently is

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:54,100
that we really put the whole value chain

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:56,860
into our teams meaning that it's more

00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:01,950
than I used to work earlier it's we also

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:04,600
used put marketing inside of it design

00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:07,120
editorial so they are really a whole

00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,580
unit that can function without any input

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,559
from outside and that was really

00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,559
important to us that they are autonomous

00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,200
sorry for the word autonomous teams so

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,139
that's what kind of differentiates us

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,269
from how we started and now the question

00:19:20,139 --> 00:19:25,870
is certainly for you like how did you

00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:28,330
decide on like why to work like this

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,659
what are the cuts and interesting we

00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:33,879
told you before we had 13 functions so

00:19:31,659 --> 00:19:36,530
we were very specialized

00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:37,850
so we had product management shop

00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,220
Anna German who also worked with

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,290
products and we had UX within the shop

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:46,330
management and we even had designers

00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:49,450
some designers who were responsible for

00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:53,600
just the card design but others did

00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:55,910
digital banners and we decided that is

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,460
too complex and its really restricting

00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:02,510
people and so the first step was really

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:05,120
to talk to people like how we can reduce

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:07,700
complexity within the functions how can

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,800
we build more generalistic domains and

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,840
again here the the best example he is

00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,490
front-end development before we had a

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,350
markup team and a JavaScript team

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,700
because when you talk to some people

00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:19,310
they say I don't want it to markup

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,610
anymore and some others say I would love

00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:25,370
to do JavaScript one day but I can't yet

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:27,740
and we talked to people and they were a

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,600
little resisting in the beginning but

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,510
after telling them you have all the time

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,040
you need you'd get the coaching you need

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,560
you do the pairing you need you do the

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:39,260
code reviews you need we decided and

00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:43,850
that was just one of the from 13 down to

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,350
7 where we went into the direction of

00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,780
having less specialists and more

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,600
generalists because otherwise you have

00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:53,690
if you just want to have one function or

00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,000
each function represented at least once

00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,890
you have a team of 13 people and you

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,870
only have one back-end developer and you

00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,450
don't have enough people to fill this

00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:07,280
once now they can had enough people to

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:11,330
fill this one now the question certainly

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:15,410
is what do you do with the I'm breaking

00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:17,420
the thing how do we decide on the

00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,850
cross-functional teams how do you form

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:22,520
them and I've talked to many other

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:25,880
companies who did that and a really good

00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:27,200
guess is go with a customer or customer

00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,260
needs if you only have one customer

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,900
group try to slice it in customer units

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,120
and form a business really along the

00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,790
customer so it is the first edge I

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:42,080
principle to deliver value to the

00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:43,940
customers and our teams now are set up

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,460
by the different customer groups we have

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,490
mostly not only but mostly we have new

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:52,000
weds

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:54,440
that team is really responsible for

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,540
getting a better service getting a

00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,360
better shop getting better cards better

00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,390
products to our newly engaged and the

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,790
people who are just married while the

00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,310
moms I'm a mom myself have totally

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:10,760
different needs we needed to be fast we

00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:12,860
don't have any time and we love the

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,260
pictures of our baby so there are really

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,480
differences that the teams can work with

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,390
to deliver better products and a better

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,940
service so that's something I would

00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,670
recommend again and about the other team

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:29,870
cut like infrastructure Stephan will

00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:33,500
sell something later and the third step

00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:36,830
we did to get this done in one day and

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:41,090
that was November 16 last year we put

00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:43,490
the entire team affected into I'd say

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,890
almost one room we had a workshop in

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,350
Munich connected to a workshop in

00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:52,810
Hamburg because we have several offices

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:56,180
and we let the teams themselves decide

00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:58,400
in which team do you want to be I mean

00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,020
surely they couldn't the back-end

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,220
developer couldn't become suddenly a

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:07,550
editorial content but they could decide

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,390
do I want to start in new weds or do I

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:14,900
want to go into the celebration squad

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,300
and we were really surprised and we

00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:21,190
scheduled four hours for that workshop

00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:23,840
and it took 15 minutes so 50 minutes and

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,430
it was really easy because people had

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,340
different preferences they had talked

00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:30,200
before and surely there's also some

00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:34,820
things we could have done better like

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,010
defining certain rules like seniority

00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,450
should be more mixed across the team

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,810
stuff like this so there are some

00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:46,120
learnings but overall we were really

00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:49,130
happy and proud that the team was so

00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:55,300
responsible and self-organized to to get

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:58,350
this done in 15 minutes and we promised

00:23:55,300 --> 00:24:01,380
unfiltered and draw to you

00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:04,320
um so now we're starting with letting

00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:06,179
our pants down and since usually I'm the

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,330
one wearing the skirt defin gets

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:13,650
together great III will start with the

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,240
best we didn't work out so there's

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,549
several things which didn't work out as

00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,690
planned of course but three things I

00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:23,160
want to focus on first of all conflict

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,990
now we'll go into detail in a second

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,890
infrastructure Tina already mentioned it

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,280
thank you

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:31,409
and the third thing is and that was one

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,080
of the toughest one long-term versus

00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:41,630
short-term thinking right so what's

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:43,740
about conflict that's really really deep

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,559
ingredient of cross-functional work

00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,750
there is conflict and it has to be

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,880
surfaced and if it's not surfaced all

00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:53,750
the cross-functionality doesn't help you

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,770
at all so don't get me wrong but if

00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:58,380
introverted developers sit with

00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,120
extroverted marketeers and the market he

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,770
always talks and the developer never

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:03,990
talks then you have a problem because

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,240
what you don't do legacy you don't do

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,830
anything like that you just do the next

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,780
product the next product because it

00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:11,280
makes so much sense and that's exactly

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,169
what happened over the first years of

00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:15,929
cotton haha that's why we had to work

00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:18,720
with anna and some other people from

00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:23,730
HPCC to get rid of legacy we're still on

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:25,260
it and it obviously had to happen in

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:27,240
this setup as well even though we were

00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:29,640
talking a lot about it the first quarter

00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,270
of okrs those our objectives per quarter

00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,600
didn't include a single legacy

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:40,020
refactoring so why was that even though

00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,600
we talked about it is because decisions

00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:46,169
were taking by the loudest in the team

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,750
and we had to work a lot on that because

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:52,049
like I said we don't have a person

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:54,840
responsible for taking per say this

00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:57,330
decisions in the team and it's also not

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,490
consensus and it's also not democracy so

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:01,679
how does it actually work it works that

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:02,309
the decisions are taken by the right

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,919
people

00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:11,190
it sounds very general and it sounds

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:12,210
very unprecedented on which is the most

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,700
beautiful banner

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:17,070
and a graphics artist shouldn't decide

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,490
on if we do test-driven development or

00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:23,640
not and if that if the team lives up to

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:25,140
that they have the right arguments with

00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,120
the right people so it's not always

00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,560
those ten people of a team sitting

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,060
together for everything and having

00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:37,490
bigger meetings now that's actually the

00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:40,650
opposite of it infrastructure squad yes

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:43,370
so the idea was quite good as I would

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:46,970
say of course I have to say that

00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:50,190
infrastructure was supposed to be a team

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:51,360
who were focusing on getting our core

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:53,520
technologies better

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,240
meaning more focusing on legacy and

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,100
doing rather bigger projects they were

00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,600
also responsible even though we work

00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,140
with a managed hosting they were at

00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:08,840
least supposed to take care of let's say

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:12,440
the link and in kind of a way DevOps

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:14,130
role as well and they were also

00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,520
supporting very important only

00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,930
supporting releases so everybody we from

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,820
the beginning we said we have end-to-end

00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:24,990
responsibility for the squad so they

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:27,270
called test and ship but what happened

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,340
in the end infrastructure obviously took

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,200
care of the releases because they were

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,820
the guys who knew best and they were the

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,030
guys who knew best what to do when

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,580
something goes wrong at that time we

00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:42,080
only deployed every two weeks so there

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:44,640
was a lot of things going wrong and

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,480
basically they were taking care of all

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,400
kinds of things which other squads

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,370
didn't want to do so if they came up a

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,200
back the other squad said and I think

00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,800
infrastructure takes care of that so

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,970
what obviously happens is this right

00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:02,160
infrastructure squad was completely

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:03,960
overloaded they couldn't again they

00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,680
couldn't focus on legacy they were just

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,810
running doing hot fixes and they took

00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:11,640
out exactly the integral part of our

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,580
cross function idea that the squad has

00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,410
end-to-end responsibility they had

00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,570
somebody to load it off to and what

00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:22,800
happens they do it unconsciously but

00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:25,680
they do it so that's basically they were

00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,830
simply that the the catch-all for

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,550
 that's that's how they I mean yeah

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:34,920
that's how it was one quote was they

00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:37,560
always destroy the codon we have to fix

00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,330
that's right they ship new stuff they

00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:42,960
don't take care of it properly and we

00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:44,190
have to fix it and last but not least I

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,730
want to talk to you about long-term

00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,470
versus short-term again we don't believe

00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,480
that there was a bad intention of the

00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,130
teams but if you're if you're a new team

00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,930
and you feel like yeah we want to get

00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,670
 done what do you do you do

00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,620
low-hanging fruits you do the things

00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,900
which were already aware of you know you

00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,360
have some impact they're not too much

00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:07,070
but you have some impact and you can get

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,900
that out there and - there's a lot of

00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,910
connection to business thinking here but

00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,660
there's also a lot of connection to

00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:16,770
development thinking so again simple

00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,410
example what do I do

00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:21,270
if there comes in a back nothing

00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:23,460
critical something you can fix in the

00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:25,290
next sprint nothing nothing crazy

00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,700
so there my point of view there are a

00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,250
couple of different ways of how you

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,110
could fix that bug first thing and that

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,450
happened mostly you can just fix the

00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:34,170
symptom right it's gone nobody sees it

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,820
anymore

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:37,910
somebody else will figure out the rest

00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:40,890
later second thing is you could at least

00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,390
refactor the code already that the the

00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:44,850
code responsible for the back already

00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,890
that didn't happen quite often and the

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:49,620
argument was always the same we don't

00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:51,870
have time for that and if you have

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,840
listened slightly at least then you

00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,030
would all agree that that's a wrong

00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,770
answer because nobody defines anymore

00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:01,410
how much time you have to fix it back

00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:03,420
you fix you have you dude you decide as

00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:05,550
a developer because you have nobody who

00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:07,230
tells you you have to do this in this

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:09,390
sprint and you have one week and you

00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,730
only have 20% overhead and you have to

00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,770
do legacy in your overhead it doesn't

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,240
happen anymore so the developer can and

00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,600
has to and that's the important part

00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,110
stand up and say no I won't do anything

00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,300
in worst case strike I told them I won't

00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,910
release I won't code anything new until

00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,890
I manage to solve this part and if

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:30,690
you're then really good and we're

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,880
talking about legacy stuff not about the

00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,800
shiny new things we have but legacy then

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,500
at least write a test for it so that

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,480
also the back even though Yuri fact that

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:42,300
it shouldn't appear anymore if it

00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,570
you know about it but without a customer

00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:49,950
calling and that didn't happen often

00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:52,080
enough and now Tina can talk about the

00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:54,390
things not worried well yeah you

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,910
probably might wonder what is the basis

00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:59,670
for why we tell you it worked well so

00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:02,400
what's the data behind it and if you

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:04,440
have a business without seasonality z'

00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,000
and no changes in marketing invest I

00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,490
think it's easy to see because your

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,120
kpi's will change now you've heard that

00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:14,370
we have many different seasonals we have

00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,800
over thirty categories and in addition

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,450
to that we also invested majorly heavily

00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,480
in marketing at the beginning of the

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:24,720
year at the same time that we changed

00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,580
the organization to create a bigger

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,720
distance to the followers in the market

00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:33,300
so it was really hard to distract like

00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:37,170
what effect is the team or is it just

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:41,520
the investment and the only way to do it

00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:44,280
was to ask the team and we we wrote down

00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:48,030
the the reasons why we changed the

00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:50,700
organization and then let the teams rate

00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:53,850
like how was it before what's your grade

00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,310
you give us and how do you rate us now

00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,210
now the question is certainly what were

00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:01,860
these factors you wanted to rate firstly

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,690
it was a closer collaboration between

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:08,880
the functions so there the CEO Saigon

00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,130
the second one was that we have a better

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,280
customer focus that's what why we

00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:16,890
changed it in addition to that more

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:20,370
responsibility for the team's personal

00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,830
growth team happiness innovation and

00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:26,280
speed let me jump in there because we

00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:27,720
didn't mention it earlier we always talk

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,000
about getting closer to the customer

00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,520
closer what does it actually mean I mean

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,050
how often have you seen developers or

00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,750
tech teams being like two or three

00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,720
layers away from extra customers for us

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:43,320
we do since then we do custom events

00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:45,420
where we do a coffee something with moms

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,980
for example and the whole team is with

00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,570
them even though there are sometimes

00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,000
Ukrainian developers and they don't

00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,080
understand everything they are there and

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,470
they get the whole thing

00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,570
and they told us afterwards that it's it

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:00,669
was like a crazy shift of mine because

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:03,009
they see what problems the custom

00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:06,309
actually have themselves so they are in

00:33:03,009 --> 00:33:09,009
the first line now sorry almost always

00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:11,289
they also some not always some who don't

00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:13,059
like it and want to have a different

00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:17,409
customer but that's a different story so

00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:20,110
back to the rating and these were the

00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:22,090
criteria and the surprising thing for me

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,429
wasn't that we didn't do a trade off and

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,249
something improved and something else

00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:30,480
got worse it was that we had a great

00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:33,970
point average on the old side on before

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,330
worse than 3.5 like somewhere for

00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:41,409
somewhere three and all of the factors

00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:44,289
to now increased so the team was saying

00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:46,809
on everything of these factors we got

00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:49,269
better I mean there's still some we have

00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:51,039
to work on but really on everything we

00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:55,179
got better and and that was really

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,999
impressive to me most importantly what

00:33:55,179 --> 00:34:00,639
got better was the Cee Lo's are totally

00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:02,470
gone because our teams are sitting

00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:05,200
together they are working together in

00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:08,260
the agile cycles they know each other

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,379
they discuss their problems and you

00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:15,659
change the social context the in-group

00:34:11,379 --> 00:34:19,149
out-group before we put them into

00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,970
cross-functional teams before we formed

00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:25,359
cross-functional teams with them they

00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:27,700
always went okay the developers are the

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,349
bad guys they are not fast enough and oh

00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,299
we are so good but we prepared the whole

00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:35,530
story and we have the different

00:34:33,299 --> 00:34:37,960
definition of ready everything is there

00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:40,510
but we're waiting and nothing happens so

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,639
it was always the other the bad guys and

00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:46,389
and it totally dissolved because there

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,510
is a mutual understanding between each

00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:51,609
other's problems and why things have to

00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:53,379
take long sometimes I meet funny things

00:34:51,609 --> 00:34:55,480
since then I have never heard a

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:57,970
developer complain about that the story

00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,940
isn't good enough not because the

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:02,799
stories got better they got way worse

00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,540
but they know what's what's actually in

00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:06,520
there they don't need to they talk about

00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,990
it a huge amount of except

00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,210
since criterion if they needed they've

00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:12,220
right in themselves because they were in

00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,990
the conversation at the same table when

00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,630
they talked about the actual feature and

00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:19,240
the actual purpose for the customer and

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,680
that's really when I enjoy working with

00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,930
the teams when you for example have a

00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:25,200
planning and you already see the sparks

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:28,420
going between the different health heads

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,130
like really syncing together oh there's

00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,660
a back side of that format then I have

00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,500
to program it as well in the

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,510
configurator

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,130
and the designers thing about Odin I

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:39,810
need a design for the two and they

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:44,200
realize early what mistakes they might

00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:46,480
make so they can pre-empting because

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,310
they talk to each other quite a simple

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,410
thing the second part you already

00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,620
brought an example for that is the

00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:55,710
customer focus we are ready for

00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,890
Christmas this year

00:35:55,710 --> 00:36:03,160
we were in the last year's because we

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:05,410
gave a team the focus and it could think

00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,240
about it the whole year certainly there

00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,280
are also other things not only Christmas

00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,380
in it but it's there and it's small

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,020
enough as a business to be manageable

00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,630
yes I mean a simple example they put it

00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:19,120
into their q 2 and a quarter two and

00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:21,970
quarter three objectives and to be ready

00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:24,370
for Christmas it sounds awful but it was

00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:26,110
really good for them yeah because they

00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:28,180
didn't have to work on the on the

00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:31,840
wedding season because it's in another

00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,550
squad and what's really interesting is

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,200
that many people stayed in the gate

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:38,560
halls and whatever that that they're

00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,180
more motivated and I still have to

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,950
figure out what's the real driver for

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,630
that whether it's autonomy or whether

00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,550
it's they have the responsibility or

00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:49,720
also because they have a broader field

00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:51,280
and their personal growth we're not only

00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,650
doing retention marketing but also

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,170
online marketing we learn constantly we

00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:59,260
have to learn otherwise we can't do what

00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:03,460
we need to do in a team I can't answer

00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:05,580
that yet but it's fun to watch and to

00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,410
close the positive side I brought one

00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:11,350
beacon of hope I would say it for the

00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:15,130
infrastructure problem one example from

00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:19,920
my from my favorite team I like to work

00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:19,920
with the moms and taking sides

00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:30,430
one of my favorite yeah okay the cat

00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:34,360
Mahad is my favorite good one example we

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:36,220
did a veto and we used exactly exactly

00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,380
this rating I told you about and the

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,570
worst rating was the speed so let's do

00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:43,900
it rate or about speed why we are bad at

00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:45,700
speed and the answers weren't like oh we

00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:47,890
talked too much in the day we talked too

00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:51,340
much in the planning but it was really

00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:55,900
we took so long to ship a project where

00:37:51,340 --> 00:38:00,190
a product in particular because we have

00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:02,320
old systems because the system we have

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:05,140
wasn't built for the product we wanted

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,520
to launch because we never went back to

00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:11,830
refactor it and it wasn't the developers

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,350
in there it was stating these facts it

00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:17,410
was everybody and it didn't matter

00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:21,190
whether designer or product manager they

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:24,940
were all agreeing that we need to go and

00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:27,130
refactor and they learned that and they

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:31,960
see the necessity now so they give the

00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:34,390
room yeah and it was actually product or

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:36,340
feature set was I don't know ten

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,880
features if you break it down into

00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:42,430
features it was a simple functionality

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,380
sounds simple it was

00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:48,100
it's a profit some product called photo

00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:50,470
box and it basically needed our

00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:53,550
configurator we have a configurator for

00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:58,200
the cards to individualize it exactly

00:38:53,550 --> 00:39:01,210
and so cards have fixed amount of pages

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,880
it's quite quite clear right so but with

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,410
photo box you can choose how many photos

00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,170
you actually want to print it's like

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,920
this old Polaroid style photos and in a

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:15,190
box the simple one-line feature which

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,960
took three months was we want to be able

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,200
to change the amount of photos inside

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,550
the configurator and because there

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,260
nothing was prepared for that and we

00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,630
were always afraid of that feature and

00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,570
that's why we never built it and they

00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,420
just said we do it and I mean it turned

00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,920
out to be wrong to put it into the first

00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,750
roll out because that

00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,060
prolonged the whole release of that

00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,250
feature for three month on an MVP it was

00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:42,190
not an MVP but the cool thing is was

00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:44,140
again that the the business people never

00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,570
mentioned that it was the developers

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:49,270
fault that it took so long but they said

00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:52,630
we were so stupid to put that into the

00:39:49,270 --> 00:40:00,970
minimum requirement set and that clique

00:39:52,630 --> 00:40:04,930
I have very seldomly heard before and to

00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:07,690
summarize the good and the bad stuff to

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:13,300
end with a note one really important

00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:15,910
basis to have an agile transformation to

00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:19,210
succeed even to go from agile to another

00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:23,350
edge rail is the mindset at the culture

00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:26,020
and if you haven't seen it before the

00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:28,330
growth versus the fixed mindset and also

00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,840
if you had kids I really recommend look

00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:34,360
into that Google management trainings

00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:38,890
also build on that sometimes it is a

00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:41,140
different how people see change if you

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:43,110
are if you don't see mistakes as a

00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,080
threat it doesn't matter if you don't

00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:49,480
manage to meet the first sprint goals

00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:51,850
there was one team who was really afraid

00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,980
and perfectionist in the beginning and

00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:56,470
it was horrible for them to work in the

00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:59,770
scrum mode because they were always like

00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:03,750
not getting things done but to lose it

00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:06,310
to use it as a learning opportunity that

00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:09,580
okay the next time we get better we

00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:13,720
didn't make it yet let's use it to

00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:18,190
improve it's a tool not not a knife that

00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:21,850
that can kill us that's really important

00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:24,030
that you you help the team's first it's

00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,910
good if you already have it in the teams

00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,860
and secondly that you help the teams to

00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:32,020
get better at that and to to ensure that

00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:34,740
there is a failure culture as well it's

00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,740
okay to make mistakes

00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:48,539
and certainly you might have already

00:41:44,059 --> 00:41:51,480
gotten our DNA we don't stop so we're

00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:54,720
still are already working on new things

00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,480
so we are having a new try at the

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,150
infrastructure the text text evan can

00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:05,279
tell more about that and you wanted to

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:09,630
yeah I mean we very seldomly nowadays

00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:12,539
say no to an opinion but there is one

00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,789
where I strongly oppose and it's when

00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:17,460
somebody says we have to stop changing

00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:19,559
so fast and it's coming back to the to

00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:23,329
the picture we still have that sometimes

00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:27,029
and it's obvious that if you do if you

00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:28,950
they could so many people and then you

00:42:27,029 --> 00:42:31,999
change the whole mindset of the company

00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:34,529
that not everybody works with that and

00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:36,569
we have to talk to those people you know

00:42:34,529 --> 00:42:38,849
I wanted you to tell the bots yeah I

00:42:36,569 --> 00:42:42,480
know texting and I'm coming to that

00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:45,599
because when people saw that

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,130
infrastructure was dissolving themself

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,369
because actually was their own decision

00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:52,019
to dissolve themselves they said ah now

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,509
finally we have something which works

00:42:52,019 --> 00:42:56,009
better and then some other said yeah not

00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:58,619
everything is perfect but let's optimize

00:42:56,009 --> 00:43:00,210
and we said no why let's let's change

00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,920
keep on changing things and there were

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,839
people reluctant to that in the first

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,539
moment but right now we're having an

00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:10,980
experiment we want to get out one more

00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:13,319
optimization one more legacy system out

00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:18,569
the way before Christmas and we form the

00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:21,960
tech stack team sophisticated name for a

00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:25,279
very simple thing it's basically me in a

00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,930
position of product owner again or

00:43:25,279 --> 00:43:30,839
technical product manager and three

00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:34,200
developers and we sit in one table they

00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:37,079
come from each squad and they now tackle

00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,329
our basket I mean our shopping cart and

00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:42,239
it's now two weeks and we're almost done

00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:44,489
and it's a really cool feeling and that

00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:47,190
might be an evolution in in the

00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:49,680
direction of having bigger problems

00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,520
which are completely across squat to get

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,460
them out of the way so we feel our whole

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,830
zatia to become more fluid and more

00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:59,080
adaptive to things which we see we don't

00:43:56,830 --> 00:44:01,330
think that squats are the answer for

00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,610
everything the world and the universe

00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:05,260
but we rather think that they are the

00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:08,380
answer for our main problem and we have

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:09,430
other answers for other problems and why

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,340
do you think it's better than

00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:15,820
infrastructure because it has a purpose

00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:19,000
so they have a clear purpose they have a

00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:21,190
clear customer they are they are

00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,190
determining themselves what is important

00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:27,610
they they don't have this externally

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:29,830
determined backlog they say we want to

00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:32,680
solve this problem and that's the way we

00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,780
do it and not like please do this

00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,680
feature there because we need it not

00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:41,320
like that but it's an experiment it's an

00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:45,010
experiment and what I like about it is

00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,710
that it's it's a task force so you you

00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:51,610
decided this is an important topic and

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:53,530
it was not a top-down decision but we

00:44:51,610 --> 00:44:55,870
all know it's critical to do it

00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:58,990
so let's form a team who really gets the

00:44:55,870 --> 00:45:00,490
time and the focus to fix it and we're

00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:02,230
doing additional things because the

00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:05,320
teams are cross-functional teams are

00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:08,230
quite large sometimes some are only four

00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:11,770
people but others are 14 now so they

00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:13,510
have to also get into I don't want to

00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:18,490
call it less or anything but they have

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:20,440
to reconstitutes and once they are done

00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:25,890
with something reforming to something

00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:28,540
else so they it's a constant

00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,400
reorganization even within the team to

00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:36,310
get things done

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:39,310
yeah and last we we're defining or we

00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:41,410
defined with the team out of the

00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,500
company-wide retrospective and need for

00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:46,840
some new roles inside the team not roles

00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,760
per se like that's the only role but

00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,950
rather additional roles to your standard

00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:55,240
role weeks are which are agile Minds

00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:57,610
they are basically satellites of the

00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:02,970
edge I coaches they get a specific

00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:05,410
training on edge I'm mindset edge I

00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:08,320
everything edge I'll above the norm

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:10,870
stuff right so you know what what scrum

00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,180
but you don't maybe know exactly the

00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:15,670
reasons why why you do the things the

00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:17,740
way you do them so they can interact in

00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:19,120
every meeting or every conversation

00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:21,640
which happens in the squad and go

00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,010
against things which which don't make

00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:25,780
sense yeah basically the devil's

00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,660
advocate because we're only two coaches

00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:31,000
so we can't do everything we need

00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,310
multipliers and it's a role that

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,990
shouldn't be dedicated to one person and

00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,750
B and we want everybody in the company

00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,940
to be agile minds in that sense so if

00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:42,280
you're interested in it you can like

00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:45,490
enhance your knowledge in that area but

00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,020
it's important I think that that there

00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:49,690
is somebody in the team we'll also

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,060
drives the the customer focus who drives

00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:55,810
the cutting things into smaller pieces

00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:59,380
to focus and show that the communication

00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:00,940
flows and we're starting with different

00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:04,900
roles so there's also like a business

00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:06,550
mind role it it's not a total product

00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,980
owner in that sense but someone who's

00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,840
now working with the team on a longer

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,390
vision because earlier you you heard

00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:16,270
we're missing the long-term vision if

00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:18,760
you just focused on on the low-hanging

00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:21,220
fruits so there are some answers we're

00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,580
finding and last but not least we're

00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:27,640
even like transforming the the agile and

00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:30,900
cross-functional working mode to other

00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:34,300
teams our support teams for example

00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:37,810
where we also want to transform the

00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,810
learnings or the success we we could see

00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:43,690
in the other teams to our support teams

00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:46,840
and hopefully last but not least also to

00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:49,300
the customer service team next year so

00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:51,160
to come back and it's how we want to

00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,050
round it up to come back to the initial

00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,320
picture that was before the

00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:59,650
transformation who can see developers

00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:02,140
they're here yeah up there far in the

00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:03,670
back right and I promise you that we

00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,250
didn't staged it that was this year's

00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:09,250
team event and it could be by

00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:10,990
coincidence but there is a developer

00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:15,160
here's the developer they're there

00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:17,320
they're there so it's completely here

00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:20,470
here it's completely

00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:24,780
mixed and it's I think it's a good

00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:27,220
indicator yeah and that's that's it I

00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,040
think we overrun the time a little but

00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:33,630
we still have some minutes for questions

00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:38,040
there are three questions here for sorry

00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:41,380
so the first one let me show it to you

00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:45,730
if we have some ideas or techniques how

00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:48,270
to break up actually into customer focus

00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:51,340
teams I think for us it was quite easy

00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:53,080
but not at it not as easy as it seems

00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:56,320
because we have clear customer groups

00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:59,350
but we also have a some people might

00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,540
call it catch-all team celebrations they

00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:03,130
are doing several celebrations in

00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:05,290
families but we have we I think we're in

00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:09,370
a good position but we also clearly

00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:11,980
decided against the way Spotify does it

00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:14,680
they broke it up more into so for

00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:16,840
example they have a team search and they

00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:19,030
have a clear technical focus on search

00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,790
and we decided clearly against that with

00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:24,100
all the downsides which brings but we

00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:26,560
decided against it so what does it mean

00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,780
everybody has to work into the shop

00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:31,920
repository if everybody has to work into

00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:34,030
the configurator without the repository

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,640
when I'm when I'm looking at the

00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:39,100
question I also have an answer because

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,680
you say you're selling into education in

00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,130
the USA so I see two options the first

00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:48,700
thing is um who are they are they

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:51,030
different types of schools who asked the

00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,030
question

00:50:10,789 --> 00:50:17,399
so do the countries have different needs

00:50:14,819 --> 00:50:30,599
like it does the education system

00:50:17,399 --> 00:50:33,630
different and therefore or could you we

00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:37,589
had always did yeah what Jimmy did is

00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:39,869
like really put it into process steps I

00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:44,339
would say really what is the customer

00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:46,079
doing at that point of time and then cut

00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:48,029
a pocket from it and then you have a

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,099
bigger probably I don't know how many

00:50:48,029 --> 00:50:52,289
guys you're but then you have one bigger

00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,179
scale which is tribe which is spot which

00:50:52,289 --> 00:50:55,769
Spotify is using which we also started

00:50:54,179 --> 00:50:57,630
using now we didn't put it in because

00:50:55,769 --> 00:50:59,909
it's too much detail but basically it's

00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,809
a group of squats which work on one

00:50:59,909 --> 00:51:05,279
purpose then again and they have a

00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:08,159
non-hierarchical try pleat meaning

00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:14,880
somebody has is working with the squats

00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:16,649
but is working on aligning them that's

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,109
maybe maybe afterwards we do for a

00:51:16,649 --> 00:51:25,199
second yeah so how often do you release

00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:30,269
depends the most favorite answer right

00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:32,880
I want the goal is clear and in all the

00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:34,829
new technologies we have it's it's

00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,859
already possible to release every hour

00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:41,069
every minute we have everyone seamless

00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:42,119
but we still have a big legacy monolith

00:51:41,069 --> 00:51:45,899
in the background

00:51:42,119 --> 00:51:48,029
Magento yeah so you guys know the

00:51:45,899 --> 00:51:49,619
problem so we are right now Magento is

00:51:48,029 --> 00:51:50,969
being released every two weeks and if

00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:53,249
there are dependencies then it's

00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:56,130
released together but we're trying to

00:51:53,249 --> 00:51:57,659
decouple it as much as possible and in

00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:00,329
terms of the whole front end for the

00:51:57,659 --> 00:52:03,679
customize its own application to replace

00:52:00,329 --> 00:52:03,679
and to replace it yeah

00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,299
do you still have a management layer

00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:16,890
here or layers that's a really good

00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:19,920
question we have we have chapter leads

00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:22,380
and so I wouldn't call it a bath but if

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,799
you remember the the matrix organization

00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:28,970
they are the how do you say Clemmie they

00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:32,910
put the bracket they are the bracket for

00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:37,319
the people working in the squats and are

00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:39,900
responsible to to push the vision and

00:52:37,319 --> 00:52:42,119
the quality in their teams so you could

00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:46,229
say before a team lead is now a chapter

00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:49,109
lead but there is a clear definition now

00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:50,729
even though it's not achieved 100% but

00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:53,430
the goal is that a chapter lead only

00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:55,920
uses 20% of its time for its chapter

00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:58,950
lead role because it's just a role and

00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,529
he's still part of a normal team so the

00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:06,089
chapter lead back end is a back end

00:53:01,529 --> 00:53:08,220
developer in a squad and so what

00:53:06,089 --> 00:53:10,680
leadership do we have generally I think

00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:13,259
anybody can lead in their field so

00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,089
that's not just a personal thing but we

00:53:13,259 --> 00:53:20,009
did do it by that I would say almost

00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:23,369
agile book and we put the king of

00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:26,160
leadership into the contents like the

00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:28,349
the expert of the chapter lead and we

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,839
also have coaches so I do see the coach

00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:33,660
as a leadership role as well

00:53:30,839 --> 00:53:36,119
because we do have we can quite mess

00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,920
with our impact as well so it includes

00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:39,569
responsibility and we have the board

00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,789
yeah but for me the important part in

00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:42,690
the question is the buff so I don't see

00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:44,849
that anymore

00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:49,140
I rather see it as supporting functions

00:53:44,849 --> 00:53:56,390
nowadays so it's it's clear and I don't

00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:56,390
know yep No No

00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:16,450
they let me think let me think about it

00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:18,130
is there even a chapter lead in their

00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:20,260
team because the chapter lead is in the

00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:23,950
chapter not in the squad so he leads

00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:26,109
technically so basically it's simply

00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:28,150
said the squat decides on what to work

00:54:26,109 --> 00:54:30,940
on and the chapter decides how to work

00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:33,340
on things so they decide we work in pair

00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:35,020
programming or we want to do test-driven

00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:37,300
development but that's all they do they

00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:39,490
don't have capacity obviously they

00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,830
should raise their voice if they see

00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,720
something which is going on but it

00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:45,400
doesn't always happen because that's one

00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:49,270
of the disadvantages of having those

00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:54,640
squats and which we clearly accept it

00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:57,160
that you have yeah you have a separation

00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:59,920
and not everybody knows everything all

00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:03,220
the time and what they so there's a

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,710
clear rule Wednesday is chapter day so

00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:08,260
the chapter should use the time exactly

00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:11,170
for this to spare for example on an MEP

00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:14,560
I came up with and honestly I think

00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:18,880
particularly that MEP we all saw it yeah

00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:22,510
I saw it but we did not but we we didn't

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:25,720
have the know-how or the the guts to say

00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:28,600
this is it's too much yeah next

00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:31,240
time we will know better I hope and and

00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:33,070
again the bus for me is the important

00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,050
part because no the board isn't the buff

00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:37,090
anymore because we don't have any

00:55:35,050 --> 00:55:40,900
reporting meetings anymore

00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:42,670
so it's now completely turned around we

00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,980
sit there doing nothing until somebody

00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:46,780
asks us for our opinion and we don't

00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,080
really want to give an opinion like a

00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:52,480
per se approval where people say like I

00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:55,240
really want to know what you say no

00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,310
please come with a proposal come with

00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,260
something you're really convinced of and

00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:02,350
then we will challenge that idea and not

00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,810
the other way around and just from what

00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:07,150
makes sense not from an approval and I

00:56:04,810 --> 00:56:09,039
know Stefan likes to see it this way but

00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:12,910
I slightly disagree

00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:14,859
I think they anybody should wait until

00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:17,169
sparing comes but also when I see

00:56:14,859 --> 00:56:18,789
something where I think it's not going

00:56:17,169 --> 00:56:27,609
in the right direction I should voice it

00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:31,140
I don't disagree so it's not totally

00:56:27,609 --> 00:56:33,699
letting loose to everything you want so

00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:36,059
on the one hand we live in la-la land

00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:39,039
that caught my eye but not in this way

00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:40,809
so Lucas is asking how we actually

00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:41,619
schedule and allocate cross-functional

00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:44,499
teams

00:56:41,619 --> 00:56:47,459
so whenever do we do team changes and

00:56:44,499 --> 00:56:51,039
the correct answer is we don't know yet

00:56:47,459 --> 00:56:53,669
so we have we tried out different things

00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,569
so it came from the team like

00:56:53,669 --> 00:56:57,759
infrastructure where they dissolve

00:56:55,569 --> 00:57:00,489
themselves because they didn't see see

00:56:57,759 --> 00:57:06,400
any purpose in what they were doing and

00:57:00,489 --> 00:57:08,559
it also came from I think one developer

00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:11,859
advocate sebastian who who gave a speech

00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:13,869
a talk yesterday who said like hey i

00:57:11,859 --> 00:57:15,999
would really like to get out the basket

00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:19,299
let's try to build up this task force

00:57:15,999 --> 00:57:21,429
before christmas and in the end we're

00:57:19,299 --> 00:57:23,259
trying to figure that out but one

00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:26,199
important thing is we didn't try to go

00:57:23,259 --> 00:57:28,659
into changing the company was having an

00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:30,489
answer for everything so we said we will

00:57:28,659 --> 00:57:32,289
figure out an answer when we need it not

00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:35,079
right now let's focus on the problems

00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:36,909
for right now Lucas

00:57:35,079 --> 00:57:41,880
did we get the question right like

00:57:36,909 --> 00:57:41,880
what's okay but you know

00:57:54,789 --> 00:58:00,189
I mean what we what we do is we didn't

00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:02,529
talk about it too much because we

00:58:00,189 --> 00:58:05,410
focused on what we call the core we have

00:58:02,529 --> 00:58:07,390
new ventures where a team works on a

00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:10,119
completely new business idea and that

00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:11,709
one for example comes up because some

00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:14,049
people in the company have a great idea

00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:16,509
and then it's some kind of a recruitment

00:58:14,049 --> 00:58:20,289
inside the company first of all and so

00:58:16,509 --> 00:58:22,390
that happens responding to external but

00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:25,119
there's a really good quote from spotty

00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:27,969
from somebody at Spotify for that if you

00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,160
want to know exactly who takes a

00:58:27,969 --> 00:58:30,999
decision at what time you're in the

00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:33,489
wrong place

00:58:30,999 --> 00:58:35,619
so it's not everything there's not a

00:58:33,489 --> 00:58:37,199
process a definition for everything and

00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:42,789
we're just trying to have the right

00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:46,419
discussion when it's necessary it's a

00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:48,669
it's a mix as well for me because for

00:58:46,419 --> 00:58:51,939
example we're now working on really what

00:58:48,669 --> 00:58:55,569
our big levers for the core teams are

00:58:51,939 --> 00:58:57,489
and for example the business mind is

00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:59,829
doing it together with the team to come

00:58:57,489 --> 00:59:02,999
up with that spares in the in the

00:58:59,829 --> 00:59:07,329
company to really get good ideas that

00:59:02,999 --> 00:59:09,189
hopefully will create revenue but he

00:59:07,329 --> 00:59:13,179
also sees when he won't need developers

00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:16,150
so maybe the ideas is to create a new

00:59:13,179 --> 00:59:17,919
channel so we use for example wedding

00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:22,169
location as channels we don't need a

00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:24,489
developer for that and they will say it

00:59:22,169 --> 00:59:26,799
exactly they just don't keep the

00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:29,439
developers because they are they are

00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:30,069
there so celebrations once what just

00:59:29,439 --> 00:59:32,650
said that

00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:34,630
honestly we see ourselves working the

00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:37,359
next couple of months on nothing where

00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:40,109
we need major development support so our

00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,640
developers can rather go to other teams

00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:45,089
and I mean that's for me the best case

00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:48,369
right if nobody on top has to say

00:59:45,089 --> 00:59:50,529
there's too many people and in in in the

00:59:48,369 --> 00:59:54,249
final goal we have positions per squad

00:59:50,529 --> 00:59:56,469
and the squad hires people internally or

00:59:54,249 --> 00:59:58,539
externally when they need and when they

00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:59,829
see that there are numbers it make in

00:59:58,539 --> 01:00:01,869
their numbers that it makes sense

00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:03,819
because now they have complete access to

01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:05,650
all their all their financial numbers

01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:07,490
that if they see it makes sense for them

01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:10,720
to hire

01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:14,450
one more senior developer they can do it

01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:18,680
we're not there yet but that would be a

01:00:14,450 --> 01:00:21,650
lovely vision for me there is one more

01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,180
question at least here in this tool how

01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:25,819
we deal with decision that affect

01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:28,339
multiple squads I would say again there

01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:31,540
is no catch-all answer but I think the

01:00:28,339 --> 01:00:36,819
the most important or the best fit is

01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:40,880
chapters again so they align over squats

01:00:36,819 --> 01:00:43,040
so if there's for example we want to try

01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:46,520
out a new technology that normally comes

01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:48,410
from a chapter or if somebody know if

01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:51,440
the whole team decides that our

01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:53,180
configurator is so sorry to use the word

01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,280
 up that we have to rewrite it

01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:58,790
that should come from the chapter and it

01:00:55,280 --> 01:01:01,849
will affect all squats and I have one

01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:04,430
rule of thumb for the decision making

01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:06,109
for me is it always depends on which

01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:08,690
decision you have to make so you should

01:01:06,109 --> 01:01:10,760
think beforehand what's the decision and

01:01:08,690 --> 01:01:14,630
who who do you need to make that

01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:16,910
decision and it's a simple simple

01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:19,520
example is that development and

01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:21,710
promotion structure for our employees we

01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:23,809
can just lock ourselves up and come up

01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:25,790
with something but we can also decide

01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:27,740
hey we need input from a really good bi

01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:30,079
guy because he's good with numbers and

01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:34,220
we do together with him and we need one

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:36,380
from the board and two really depending

01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:38,470
on what we do get the right people into

01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:41,960
the boat and then manage the process

01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:45,109
that it runs effectively okay so since

01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:50,180
we run really out of time the the bigger

01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:52,400
the decision like you should or when

01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:55,369
it's a real big decision you should make

01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,799
sure that you had an advisory process

01:01:55,369 --> 01:02:00,260
and not maybe only internally but also

01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:03,680
externally so that's why I mean it is

01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:05,900
also often in our house yeah so yeah

01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,700
thanks everybody if there are any more

01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:10,190
questions we will still be here a couple

01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:12,170
of minutes so feel free to come to us

01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:17,980
and ask

01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:17,980
[Applause]

01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,880
