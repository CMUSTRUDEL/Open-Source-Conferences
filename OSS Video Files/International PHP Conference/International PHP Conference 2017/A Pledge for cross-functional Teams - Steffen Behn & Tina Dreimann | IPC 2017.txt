Description: 
	Steffen Behn (die kartenmacherei) and Tina Dreimann (die kartenmacherei) at IPC 2017: One year ago, we were still happy to have scrum tech teams shielded from the rest of the organisation. Product managers were our gatekeepers for outside stakeholders. Our developers were even based in another office. Twelve months later we have changed the setup completely. Strongly inspired by the Spotify model, we transformed the structure of our product company into a network of fully cross-functional and self-organized teams. Discover why we took such a drastic step, what worked and what did not work â€“ unfiltered and raw.
