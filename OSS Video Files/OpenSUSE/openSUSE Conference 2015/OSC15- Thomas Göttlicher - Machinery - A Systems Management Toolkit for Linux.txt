Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Alfred is a system administrator of a real world data center. He faces the reality of systems nobody knows about, people making mistakes and forgetting about best practices, or not riding the latest DevOps trend. SUSE has started an open source project to help Alfred to keep his sanity and fill the gaps current tools don't address yet. The project is Machinery (http://machinery-project.org) and it is released for openSUSE as well as SUSE Linux Enterprise. The presentation will provide a deep dive into what Machinery can do for system administrators and how the community can benefit and contribute.
