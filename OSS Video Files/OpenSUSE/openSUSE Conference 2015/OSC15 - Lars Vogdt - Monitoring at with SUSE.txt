	Thousands of running services on hundreds of machines ask the admins to pay attention. At all times, on all channels, with all available software packages that openSUSE has to offer. Lars does not only keep an eye on all devices inside SUSE R&D, he is also maintaining some of the biggest packages in the server:monitoring repository like Nagios, Icinga, Shinken, check_mk, mod_gearman, Naemon, PNP4Nagios or the monitoring-plugins (and others). The integration of some of those packages into a complex, secure and high available monitoring setup together with some tips and tricks and insights into the SUSE R&D infrastructure will be demonstrated.
