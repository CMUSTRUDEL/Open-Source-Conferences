	00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,710
I

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:26,540
just

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,020
I

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,009
I

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,520
Oh

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,230
it's cool

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,900
we

00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:28,810
it

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
I

00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,980
yes

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,970
so

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,410
the

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,350
and

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,360
k tonight

00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,470
now

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:09,649
support that things you believe

00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:09,649
Oh

00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,490
which is

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,490
Oh

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,720
there are no videos

00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,030
the video

00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:34,110
in box

00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:11,999
so

00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
I

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:32,440
the most is

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:42,850
they just

00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:44,919
I

00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:04,409
so

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,220
Oh

00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,470
Oh

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,040
and

00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,880
baby

00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:16,179
to do

00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:32,460
three years

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:49,360
so we drop the ball that intentionally

00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:49,360
and

00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,780
very good

00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:15,929
now we are the situation where we again

00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:18,600
need to drop the ball and somebody else

00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,669
needs to pick it up on my part I moved

00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,440
out of Souza and with own cloud now so

00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:24,720
I'm not really connected with that so

00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:27,600
much and I said I can no longer maintain

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,100
the infrastructure and I cannot make the

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,289
organization helping like recruiting

00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:33,690
people who are volunteers who want to go

00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:36,179
that and I dropped the ball there and

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:42,119
apparently applause to Martin he picked

00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:44,340
it up so so this is your official

00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:48,119
appointment now you are the team lead of

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,799
the opensuse wiki team now you heard the

00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:53,759
applause there's no way denying that

00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:55,379
that's that's your ball now so the

00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,340
important message I want to leave here

00:25:55,379 --> 00:26:01,350
is we have a technical call it crisis or

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,629
situation that needs to be fixed because

00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,309
we need to switch over to other software

00:26:03,629 --> 00:26:08,129
to other hardware you already found some

00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:09,869
solutions for that that's way cool but

00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:12,059
we also need to have a community around

00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:13,679
that there are many other as we

00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:16,499
mentioned many other conferences that

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,809
also do pretty much the same as we do so

00:26:16,499 --> 00:26:21,769
go there ask the people how do you

00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:24,179
record how do you do that and try to

00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:27,480
bring that together so I thought I don't

00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:30,149
want him to create another island from

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,820
some technology that some other guys in

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:35,100
the u.s. does and nobody in in Europe

00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,960
does with the deviance I was quite happy

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,299
because they do it all over in Europe

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,129
and that was good until firewaia

00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:45,330
suddenly well eventually die it away and

00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:48,330
so we have to recreate that on a new

00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:50,730
technology HDMI is in the picture every

00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:51,960
camera can do that and there are some

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,460
grabbers around which are quite

00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,919
expensive there's open source hardware

00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:59,009
that can do that so technically it's

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:03,720
doable but it needs people to plan that

00:26:59,009 --> 00:27:05,730
to go there and carry on the ball so

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,909
there's this many aspects that I have in

00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:11,490
mind for that but I don't want to flood

00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:14,669
you all with my crazy ideas so is there

00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,920
any input from you like what are others

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:19,530
doing what do you like about that if you

00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:22,800
experience with that for example other

00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:25,050
conferences that would be a question I

00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,880
would ask to the room so that we don't

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:32,280
create and invent something that's

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:34,710
already out there so if there's no good

00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,300
ideas and I heard that before that

00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,920
there's not really good ideas most

00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:40,560
people just record and do post

00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:42,240
processing and I want to have live

00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,700
stream there because that's that's just

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,130
cool to have it and it gives us the time

00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,980
pressure to really do it and not wait on

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:52,190
somebody later to make the recording

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,510
happen life is not the perfect quality

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:58,320
but I think for conference like this

00:27:54,510 --> 00:28:00,750
it's good enough and it gives us the

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,710
pressure to really finish the job and

00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:06,390
not just delay it on and on and on so

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,600
that's one thing right want to stick to

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:12,510
the general setup like this have a mixer

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,830
there in the room do it live and once

00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:17,700
the recording is there it can be

00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:21,360
uploaded that that's my suggestion for

00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:24,060
the future and don't change the process

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,100
so much rather change the software that

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,590
does the recording and try to keep the

00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,870
setup as similar as possible especially

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,520
as we know there are many people out

00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,160
there in the conference's that do a

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,810
similar setup for for Debian and there's

00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,540
the other one I know that's from the

00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:42,630
chaos computer club in Berlin the c3

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,580
walk team they do a similar setup but

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,690
they have money with much more hardware

00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:52,050
and they have their four kids like every

00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:54,600
organization that joints their way of

00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:57,180
doing video every organization should

00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,310
build up a set of this hardware which is

00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:01,920
a mixer and cameras and all the

00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:05,040
equipment and train one or two people

00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,070
and then if a conference comes near that

00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:10,560
place they pulled together two or three

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,790
of the sets do the conference with the

00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,720
equipment they have and they ship it

00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:19,610
back home so this is like a shared pool

00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,610
of equipment that is around in the world

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,320
yeah I think this is this perfect idea

00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:29,280
what what we should do because at the

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:32,190
moment everything this odd heart I was

00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:34,590
on the conference then we put it back to

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,080
the Susa which stay for one year in the

00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,300
boxes nobody care and then suddenly I

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,160
don't know 23 weeks before the

00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:43,260
conference somebody unpack the boxes and

00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,480
say oh what is this the laptop is broken

00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:49,410
camera is not working and make

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:52,260
immediately a lot of panic and stress so

00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,870
we maybe should do in this way that we

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,300
will build the small small boxes and the

00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:01,650
people who want to be in the video team

00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:03,900
will join to these things and have that

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,740
works is at work or something like that

00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:09,810
and we they will be responsible for dead

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,020
things that it's working and it's fine

00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:15,840
and when the conference will be closing

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:20,450
in the one month we can have a team

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:25,170
meeting on a real phone and all kinds of

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:27,600
things and we can see if everything is

00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:30,510
ready if there are any problems who will

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:34,260
go on the conference that the hardware

00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:36,600
is and and things like that and that

00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:40,760
it's just about of communication it's

00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:44,550
not much much big problem to do it and

00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,830
it's better than have these things for

00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,990
example this this year white colleagues

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:51,690
at all we tested everything but then I

00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:54,600
came here and the high drive was not

00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,940
working because somebody put the wrong

00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,480
charger for these things the second

00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:03,630
second was that the disk on the one

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,180
laptop have only eight Giga free space

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:08,610
this is like less than one hour ago

00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:11,670
heading it's horrible you know and and

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,890
so on so to avoid these problems with

00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:19,350
video grinding we need people in the

00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:21,780
team who really want to be there and we

00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:24,090
can we can we can have kind of meetings

00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:26,700
some day after the conferences or before

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:31,830
the conferences maybe better before and

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:35,400
sit together teaching each other how we

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:37,910
are doing this and make a better

00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,910
recording

00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,049
for the further for the general

00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:44,749
organization I have a very simple

00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:47,909
proposal I don't know if it would work

00:31:44,749 --> 00:31:51,599
this year we saw it how it should not

00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:53,279
work like when I asked two months before

00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,289
the conference is there anybody taking

00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,559
care of infrastructure taking care of

00:31:55,289 --> 00:32:00,690
video who is organizing that then from

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,580
Susie the answer came back oh yeah

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,039
somebody should do that right you're

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,659
right we want to continue do you want to

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,179
lead that I said oh hey I'm no longer

00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:10,499
with Susie I have really no time and you

00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:13,469
should do that in house or with a

00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:16,019
community somehow together and that was

00:32:13,469 --> 00:32:18,749
the hard way to find out that is needed

00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,969
that is an organization around that so

00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:24,029
my proposal is very simple like for

00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:27,509
example Martin as the one who is the

00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:31,200
head on for for video i would suggest

00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:32,789
whenever there is a like this conference

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,679
or if less faust them where you go two

00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,320
or there's linux talking billion or

00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:39,119
kemnitz and any any of the conference

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,009
where we go to and where we have more

00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:44,460
than just one speaker where we have

00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:47,729
rooms and and words worth recording for

00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,369
such a conference calculate backwards

00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:53,369
three months in ahead of time and make a

00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:56,159
call and try to grab people together is

00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:58,859
there anybody going who can help really

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,629
three months ahead of time and if you

00:32:58,859 --> 00:33:02,639
say that it's easy i'm going there i'm

00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:04,950
organizing that and say okay we need

00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:07,289
another call when like a month ahead or

00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:09,359
if it's a huge setup like this one when

00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:11,879
we play for three rooms or four rooms

00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,469
and need a technical setup then we

00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:15,200
should really start like three months

00:33:13,469 --> 00:33:17,969
ahead of time and then every two weeks

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,859
they call a meeting ioc session or

00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:22,289
whatever the best form it is so that we

00:33:19,859 --> 00:33:24,599
have a regular schedule and see how it's

00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:26,909
progressing or it's not progressing if

00:33:24,599 --> 00:33:28,440
you are relaxed on time like we say we

00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:30,149
can skip the next meeting because

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,609
there's nothing to discuss everything is

00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:34,139
on track that's perfect on the other

00:33:32,609 --> 00:33:37,289
hand if you just start one week ahead

00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:39,570
then we run into trouble like I don't

00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:43,169
want to repeat what we did this time we

00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:47,099
had all of thursday to lay the first

00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:48,809
power cables today the network cables

00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:50,590
and to do the setups for the rooms that

00:33:48,809 --> 00:33:52,990
was one day Thursday

00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:55,299
for three rooms that's not the best way

00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,340
to do it and there were only three

00:33:55,299 --> 00:34:00,159
people like the two of us were not even

00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,010
here so it was it was three others that

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,620
did it Lars tarick's and Robert so it's

00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:07,539
all on them to do this set up here at

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,669
least for the Wiggio team something like

00:34:07,539 --> 00:34:11,530
that is best avoided if people are there

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:12,849
ahead of time and talk to each other

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:14,770
actually that's the most important

00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:17,080
because they were volunteers already in

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:19,510
the city and asked for where should I

00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:23,830
help there was no communications going

00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:25,929
on so that's my simple suggestion find

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:27,730
out the conference's when they are and

00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:30,820
then calculate backwards three months

00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,500
and start the first round and find out

00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,609
is there anybody who wants to travel

00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,490
around the world is there somebody

00:34:33,609 --> 00:34:39,280
locally for next year it will be much

00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:41,440
easier when we have conference in

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,149
Nuremberg that means there are many many

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,790
Suzy people around there I will be

00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:48,220
definitely around maybe some of the

00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:53,139
foreigners will come again love to see

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:55,060
you and so I guess then we don't have

00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:57,640
the issue of not not enough people there

00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,430
in Nuremberg we have them it's just the

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,900
idea of organizing everything it's a

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:04,359
hardware issues also so we have to

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:07,180
prepare the hardware and software yeah

00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:09,580
and then also may be kind of wiki

00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:12,940
material to do how to do how to not to

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:15,609
do things and this this documentation

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:17,410
for a people who will actually occur

00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:24,910
with the staff and paper the stuff

00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:28,800
before and I think that the most things

00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:33,040
how to start it that the public eye as

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:37,210
leader of these things will try to weld

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,460
kind of news on the lizard or a noose

00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:41,530
opensuse org about those things that we

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:43,540
are looking for the volunteers that for

00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:47,109
people who want to work it with us and

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:49,480
be in touch and create the group I don't

00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:53,410
know if someone from five to ten maybe

00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:56,710
twenty people depends on on the interest

00:35:53,410 --> 00:36:00,310
for the volunteers and bid them beat in

00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:03,430
the touch with the email and IRC and do

00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:04,359
as you said see months before one months

00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:08,589
before

00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:10,839
and even create kind of a list what kind

00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:17,650
of hardware we have who has it actually

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:20,980
I built not may be in dead things that

00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,690
everything will be stored in a in Susa

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,410
for one year and nobody will watching

00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:28,059
for that thing's tested it and try it

00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:30,519
headed that things would be that if we

00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:33,880
split this into I don't know two three

00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:38,230
five locations each one the set and can

00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:40,539
do his local independent recording that

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:43,450
means he also can attempt the things

00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:46,509
like a linux talk or linux days in fact

00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,759
and if we have a track there for

00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:51,759
opensuse he can record all the stuff

00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:56,859
there independently on the on the under

00:36:51,759 --> 00:37:01,660
local things look Lucas stuff so that's

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:12,190
this any other idea any more questions

00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:14,499
from the audience you just so basically

00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:17,440
a feature request because you notice

00:37:14,499 --> 00:37:20,619
that we had a second camera in the poet

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,109
project meeting this morning and it's a

00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:25,749
bit hard tuchus can I quickly move

00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:28,480
around to the next speaker am I on the

00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:31,869
stream just now so it would be nice if I

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,119
somehow have feedback like the easiest

00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:35,619
thing red light at the camera or even

00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,430
better at the live stream on my laptop

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,630
screen next to the cabepfir yeah I

00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,420
understood that I will take care of this

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:46,180
I will make this feature happen I wanted

00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,039
to do that with TV switch already but

00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,380
i'm not going to implement that with tvs

00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:52,299
which we first choose or a new software

00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,630
platform and then you get yours feature

00:37:52,299 --> 00:37:58,359
I promise that I know that it's very

00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:00,369
critical for a secondary camera man to

00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:03,940
know when he's live or when he is not

00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:05,769
live currently we could only wave across

00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,170
the room like you are on or no you are

00:38:05,769 --> 00:38:10,390
not on and be careful what you do and

00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:12,339
now you can move your camera we need to

00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:15,009
relearn hand signs in the room that's

00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:17,380
not really that good so next generation

00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:17,590
will have a screen for each camera where

00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,050
he

00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:21,910
these are hard this is what's going on

00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:24,940
or maybe even have whatever I really

00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,490
like is an online chat integrated in the

00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:29,470
the mixer panel we have a few lines of

00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:31,960
text messages any bear can't bear can

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:34,090
type something and talk to all the other

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,710
people that are in the room or to the

00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,840
back office people that sit on the

00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,820
server and do the encoding so that we

00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:44,710
have a way to communicate without

00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:46,180
actually talking or whispering which is

00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,850
sometimes not possible in a small room

00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:50,830
like this and where the echo is very bad

00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,230
imagine that the two or three in the

00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:55,360
back that do does this thing right now

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,870
if they would constantly talk to each

00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:00,370
other you couldn't hear anything in in

00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:03,610
some conferences we did it with other

00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:05,710
ideas which was cool to have a small

00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:08,740
radio and talk about it is a problem but

00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,360
this video was constantly pppppp beeping

00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,300
like the people while talking to each

00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:17,950
other in different rooms which didn't

00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:20,200
work well so the last thing if you like

00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:22,600
to stand up and walk a little bit around

00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,760
the room I'd like to give you a show

00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,470
where everything is placed and how it's

00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:29,530
connected the most interesting part is

00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:32,200
in the far back of the room where we are

00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:35,020
currently doing exactly what Martin

00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:37,060
described we are filming with the camera

00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,620
we are grabbing the slides there's a

00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:41,350
laptop that mixes everything together

00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,270
and actually sends it out to the

00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:45,160
Internet do you have network on their

00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:49,230
laptop you can actually show that if it

00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:53,290
works so we can complete the loop now

00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:56,050
talking about is set up while the setup

00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:59,650
is working and we can present the end

00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:01,360
result on screen to see that I can wave

00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,490
in the camera and a few seconds later

00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,570
you should see me waving their that

00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:09,250
would be great to see if it actually

00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:12,550
works there on that channel yeah and if

00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:15,130
we are good we see we see like yeah we

00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:16,690
are live that's cool and there should be

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,150
two live streams actually we can also

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,329
sneak over in the other hall yeah after

00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:26,220
two

00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:27,960
this is us this isn't the main hole so

00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:30,869
we can sneak into the main hall and see

00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:37,140
what they are doing and we can really

00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:39,030
life is it let know if you shot on their

00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,710
slides you cannot see me waving you need

00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:44,910
to use the camera then you can see me

00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:47,700
waving and there's a delay oh yeah

00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:52,250
that's me that's me baby okay cool so

00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,250
that's how it works actually thank you

00:40:53,150 --> 00:41:09,329
one more yeah so how much delay do we

00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:10,980
have one two three four five okay so it

00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:13,650
takes five seconds for the signal to

00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:16,260
travel out there to the internet and

00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:21,539
back to his laptop which is cool it's

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:23,460
not much so very delayed I have to

00:41:21,539 --> 00:41:29,900
repeat myself for each other speaker

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,900
saying the same it's great fun

00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:42,890
yes as long as they're nothing coming

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:45,590
backwards I'm fine oh yeah we could open

00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:50,060
the audio and you are you and hear us

00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:53,450
talking in cycles here that would work

00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:57,440
to you okay so much for the presentation

00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:58,850
yeah this is this is done I think and we

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,940
can show you what we have here how we

00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:04,700
are doing how it's connect and I will

00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:08,210
wrote the proposal the things which we

00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,850
talked about it on or on kind of blog

00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,800
and search for volunteers so then you

00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:14,540
can step up and say hey I want to be

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,140
there I want to join to this team and I

00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:21,730
want to work on this close together with

00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:21,730
