	Hawk is a cluster configuration and management tool implemented as a Ruby on Rails app which runs on Linux HA clusters. It includes features for monitoring clusters, configuring new cluster resources, simulating changes to the cluster, setting up access control lists and more. This session is an introduction to High Availability clusters in general, focusing on using the Hawk web interface to interact with a cluster, modify resources, and using its history explorer feature to quickly figure out what has happened based on cluster events and logs.
