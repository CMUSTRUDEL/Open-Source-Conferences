Title: OSC15 - Michael Schloh von Bennewitz - How and why to protect communications with Tor
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Proxy bridging, tunneling, and routing are some of the most useful and least understood networking techniques that novice users can leverage in their daily work. We'll consider use cases for connecting OpenSUSE clients over SOCKS5 proxies generically as well as examine the topic of cross platform client anonymization and how the onion router achieves a high degree of communications protection by combining a number of concepts like random relaying, bridging obstacles, encryption, browser lockdown, pluggable transport, and obfuscation techniques.

As users, we'll see how proxy technology can safeguard personal data and return us to the free world. As developers, we'll consider use cases integrating Tor libraries and modules as well as administrators choosing the right pluggable transports. We'll see how easy it is for attorneys, doctors, patients, law enforcement, and even novice geekos to use proxy connectivity to increase security and productivity in daily work.
