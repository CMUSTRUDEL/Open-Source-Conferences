Title: OSC15 - Michael Schloh von Bennewitz - How and why to protect communications with Tor
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Proxy bridging, tunneling, and routing are some of the most useful and least understood networking techniques that novice users can leverage in their daily work. We'll consider use cases for connecting OpenSUSE clients over SOCKS5 proxies generically as well as examine the topic of cross platform client anonymization and how the onion router achieves a high degree of communications protection by combining a number of concepts like random relaying, bridging obstacles, encryption, browser lockdown, pluggable transport, and obfuscation techniques.

As users, we'll see how proxy technology can safeguard personal data and return us to the free world. As developers, we'll consider use cases integrating Tor libraries and modules as well as administrators choosing the right pluggable transports. We'll see how easy it is for attorneys, doctors, patients, law enforcement, and even novice geekos to use proxy connectivity to increase security and productivity in daily work.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,309
so I think we can start hi suni welcome

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:12,719
and it's see I think it's time yeah it's

00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:15,570
time to get started so just to let you

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,279
know this is a presentation on tour so

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,859
we'll be talking about using tor

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,130
installing it configuring it not so much

00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,220
development because it's a it's a

00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:28,859
beginning level presentation my name is

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,489
Michael Schlow phone benifits nice long

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,320
German name and I live in munich i'm a

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,420
software engineer with my own company

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,700
and i do consulting for telecom

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,350
customers and a little with mobile some

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,710
browsers mozilla and tour as well I

00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:48,360
don't have my clicker luck so in this

00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:52,559
half hour we'll get started by defining

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:56,340
tour to understand what it is see how to

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,820
install build it configure and do a

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,250
simple test so we know how to use it

00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,309
from a command line as well as from a

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:09,260
browser which is how most people use the

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:11,790
tour proxy by using the tor browser

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:14,280
there will be plenty of live

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,799
demonstrations and at the end we'll take

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,110
a look at how it works internally how it

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,799
writes how it routes the various packets

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:31,049
from the originating application to the

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:33,780
service that it's connecting to so this

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,549
is what wikipedia says about tor what is

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,920
tor exactly it's quite a lot of text

00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,909
there but this is one of the the main

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:49,320
definitions it's a router for TCP

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:52,439
connections and routes it's it's it's a

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:54,960
tough definition to to swallow because

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,899
it's not only a client tour as a network

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,329
which which offers hidden services for

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:01,740
example as well I think we see that best

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:04,469
later when we look at the various

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,369
projects here are some other definitions

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:12,700
focusing on acronyms so T 0 r started

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:14,230
The Onion Router but as of late

00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,030
kind of more than that it's the people

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:18,160
involved the contributors the various

00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,950
projects there's more than just the

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,190
proxy and server today so it's basically

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:28,150
the entire project Network that's what

00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:33,160
we consider tour to be and if you ever

00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:34,599
see it written all caps like that that

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,430
means a person doesn't know what they're

00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:38,080
talking how if they think that it's The

00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:40,950
Onion Router and there may be living

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,299
back in this in the 80s or something

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,819
little teat or you might hear this

00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:48,370
expression will use it quite a lot today

00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:52,599
little tea tour is basically the command

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:56,140
line tor server which you execute on the

00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,690
command line and it connects to the Tor

00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:02,140
network so we'll take a look at that

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,690
later it's a socks5 proxy so if you are

00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,120
if you search for socks5 you can kind of

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:12,700
understand what for a protocol that is

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:17,829
and it's a generic abstraction protocol

00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:21,609
for TCP what's very popular is the socks

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:24,430
I'm sorry that the tor browser for many

00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:26,290
reasons it's actually what's suggested

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:29,319
to use we're going to be looking a lot

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,530
at the little tour the little tea tour

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:34,209
but most people use a tor browser will

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,329
take a look at that as well later and

00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:39,760
then there's a whole variety of projects

00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,859
which are decommissioned like Vidalia

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,900
privoxy provides he actually is not

00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,450
decommissioned it's living and well but

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:54,430
it was never part of tor tor was using

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:57,700
it to to serve as a to serve as a second

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,209
abstraction they're quite a lot of those

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:03,069
and this is we this is kind of a funny

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,810
thing because if you ever hear about the

00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:06,120
dark web you're not talking about tor

00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,980
you're talking about misinformed

00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,750
politicians or journalists who are

00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,690
aiming to get their story on the front

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:18,250
page with some buzz words right so this

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,500
is a this is a non definition just to

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,950
keep that clear I really hate that word

00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,340
dark web anyway so these are the sub

00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:30,410
projects of the

00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:32,150
or network and what we have in addition

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,860
to the little tea tour which I didn't

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,840
even put on there because it's obvious

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,910
is the tor browser we have all of these

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,460
things i'll try to give a quick rundown

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,280
not even sure I can get this right so

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,060
tour to web is basically an index of

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,740
hidden services which in a half hour

00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,330
presentation we don't have time to get

00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,280
into Hidden services kind of the

00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,440
opposite of what most people do with

00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,020
tour when they're using it as a client

00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,900
to reach out and connect to services

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:02,450
hidden services is a service provider

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,690
who's placing their service on the Tor

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:08,870
network tour birdies i believe

00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:12,370
thunderbird extension which allows your

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:15,260
Thunderbird 2 to serve as a tour client

00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,470
tails is really exciting this is really

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:25,460
really cool right here tails it stands

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:28,220
for was it here on the VIP what does it

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:31,760
stand for it's on one of these slides I

00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:33,680
know it no it's not there so it's got a

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,639
really good name but it's basically a

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,620
distribution a line x distribution which

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,000
once you start it up it does not access

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,460
the hard drive it has a lot of

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,520
additional protections that the tour

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:48,139
proxy is not made to address so

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,840
obviously as soon as you started up

00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,720
Torres running and if you click on a

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,349
browser you're you're loading up Firefox

00:05:53,720 --> 00:06:00,770
but it's configured to use tor proxy as

00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:03,320
by default so it's like a USB solution

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:06,289
for people who are on the move and they

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:11,870
just want to be extra careful you know

00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:14,960
anybody so unie is a this one I can't

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,300
remember the difference here so this one

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,960
is I believe yeah this is the project

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,450
that many countries are running this in

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,010
in in their networks are you know just

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,080
contributors like people like us in

00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:31,210
countries say let's take a just a wild

00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,210
example Iceland or Brazil or

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:37,650
Nepal and you basically run this service

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,290
and it reaches out to makes random

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,630
queries and then sees what things are

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:45,570
censored and which aren't and it tries

00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,540
to understand if people are monitoring

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:50,640
the the TCP headers that are sent out by

00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,820
your client and then what it does it

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,310
reports these statistics I think to a

00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,480
central server or maybe it does it over

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,970
a peer-to-peer network so that it kind

00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,320
of broadcasts the results so that if

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,200
we're in Germany we want to know okay

00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,150
I'm traveling to Nepal am I going to

00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,890
have any problems there then we have the

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:19,080
statistics at hand by this project it's

00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:22,500
quite useful so obs Oh BFFs proxy is a

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,280
is a transport that works together with

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,190
tor hand in hand which makes all of the

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,780
the efforts at defeating tour serve a

00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:35,940
defeating tour more difficult so what it

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,540
basically does one of the the transport

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:42,979
methods it has very many of them is that

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:46,229
it it sends your your network connection

00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:48,750
over a content content delivery network

00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:50,820
a CDN like for example Google has one or

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,190
Akamai or something and there is not a

00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,620
single government on the planet that is

00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,240
going to censor completely censor any of

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,010
these connections for a variety of

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,470
reasons they just they can't figure out

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,990
which ones are legitimate and which ones

00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:07,380
aren't so that's a very smart use of a

00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,910
CDN network it's actually a little more

00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,710
complicated than that but it gets into

00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:14,220
HTTP headers and how to redirect them

00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,470
and so on or bot is basically tour for

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:18,660
Android so that's quite a cool thing

00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,110
there's a lot of Android users and then

00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,830
tour cloud I think is a in Amazon based

00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,290
it means that any of us were the ECE

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:31,860
with a III C or whatever that the

00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,110
cloud-based Amazon solution is we can

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,270
kind of contribute to the Tor network to

00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:38,729
help things go a little faster if we

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,380
want to do things really simple and then

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:42,940
of course the tor browser will be using

00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,070
in the demonstration later on

00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,079
let's see so if we want to install tour

00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,449
and we're opensuse users like we all are

00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:52,839
and what we might do is start out by

00:08:50,449 --> 00:08:56,600
looking on you know the software

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,980
application or online and if you typed

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,430
or up here you're going to get all sorts

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,959
of stuff can tour and bittorrent and

00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:04,160
whatever else there is there you just

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,779
won't find the thing that you're looking

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,990
for right even if you search to the

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,540
sixth page if you try to find the tour

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:14,720
socks program which we're going to use

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:16,579
later on as well for testing that's that

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,459
comes up but this is an this is this

00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:21,860
points to a non official repository so

00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:24,050
you've kind of got to add that to your

00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,579
posit or e list this is I'm trying to

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,339
say there's quite a lot of problems

00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:31,009
finding tour the tor browser tour bundle

00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:32,690
doesn't exist at all in any repository

00:09:31,009 --> 00:09:35,810
that you can search for so we're going

00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:38,300
to do is use a command line if you type

00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:40,480
cyber search tour you do get some

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,970
results and these are in official

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,130
repositories so that's quite useful and

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:48,319
this is the the base of the basically

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,380
the easiest way to install the tor

00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:53,510
server their little teat or on your

00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,019
opensuse machine you install it in the

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:59,889
user way usual usual way was I / there

00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:04,100
and if we look we scroll down a little

00:09:59,889 --> 00:10:10,459
will kind of see how that works out too

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:13,010
much scrolling there and then we take a

00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:16,839
look at what was installed and we get

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:19,699
the tor server there as well as a

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:23,240
configuration file and a bunch of other

00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:27,649
things like Torah Phi which is useful as

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:29,660
well to wrap non tour programs like

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:36,350
telnet or anything else that works with

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:39,740
TCP um so tour socks is a useful program

00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:43,339
which we can use if we have an IRC chat

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,709
program anything it doesn't it doesn't

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:47,689
even have to be command line based it

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:51,019
just has to work with TCP so if we have

00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:53,510
a chat program or anything that we want

00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:55,250
to protect with tour but doesn't have a

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,100
configuration or we don't know how to

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,269
use it

00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,569
with tor you basically run tour socks as

00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:06,990
as first as a first command and then

00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:08,940
we'll see it later but it it wraps the

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:14,029
program that you're trying to Torah Phi

00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:16,529
and and sends all network connections

00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:20,730
over the Tor network instead of the

00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:22,680
clear text non-protected network you can

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,000
see how that works when we scroll down

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,339
and these are the things that it

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:37,019
installs not too many things looks good

00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:39,180
doesn't it right I think the last day is

00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:42,750
basically running tour so after we have

00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:45,449
it installed via cipher for example it's

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:47,699
pretty easy to use you don't even need

00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:51,120
to be rude so you're the normal user and

00:11:47,699 --> 00:11:54,240
it's going to be listening on port 9050

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,839
on your localhost and what that means is

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,759
that anything you run on that computer

00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:03,360
will connect to this address and port

00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:06,060
and then that will reconnect to other

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,130
ports on different other computers on

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,300
the Tor network and bounce things around

00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:16,339
as we'll see later and if you were to do

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:20,069
a diff of a netstat command before and

00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:21,870
after we run this tour command we would

00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:24,110
cease at this that some additional ports

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:26,850
are open on your network on your

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,970
computer we would see first of all the

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,100
local host with port 9050 is open which

00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:39,509
we saw here is opening a sox listener

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:44,930
and and we would see as well that there

00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:49,290
is a connection what from I see from

00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:52,529
yeah from from the from the tour program

00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:58,019
going outward to another computer

00:12:52,529 --> 00:13:00,000
somewhere over to port 9001 and that

00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:05,130
other computer is serving as it as a

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,019
tour relay so that's why so it I know

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,550
it's it's a little confusing now but

00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,420
we'll take a look at how that works

00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:13,610
later

00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:16,070
here's basically how to test if tour is

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:20,209
working properly what you really want to

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:23,360
know is that without using tor you get

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:25,490
your real IP address sent back to you by

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,100
a service like for example what is my IP

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:30,019
com so if you just type what is my IP

00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,600
com and a browser window the one that

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:33,829
you have open right now nothing will

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,769
happen because the network here is

00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:38,450
broken but if it was working then you

00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:43,060
would get this kind of address right a

00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:45,560
basic IP address associated with your

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:50,089
computer or the or the router for this

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:52,160
network now if you if you do that when

00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,769
you're using a tour program like I

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,110
described before instead of only telling

00:13:54,769 --> 00:14:00,130
it in the same way as up here you wrap

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:02,240
that with Torah Phi or tour socks

00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:06,140
horrifying tour socks are actually the

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,320
same thing sorry but if you wrap that

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,750
with one of these then you end up with a

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,269
different result so your IP address

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,500
really is the same but the service that

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,870
you're connecting to doesn't know that

00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,550
and that's the whole point the service

00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:21,649
that you're connecting to doesn't know

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,620
who you are where you located or what

00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:26,750
you're browsing signature is right so

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,690
that's kind of the way to test to know

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:33,110
if tour is working and what happens when

00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:37,190
you use Torah Phi on ssh or anything

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:40,519
else any other tcp program is that it's

00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:45,740
going to connect to that local host port

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:47,959
that we saw earlier 9 9 05 and and then

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,019
that will forward that connection on to

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:57,260
other computers running tour throughout

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:59,660
the network if we wanted to serve tour

00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,279
connections inbound from other from

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,570
elsewhere because remember we just had

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:12,320
localhost open then we could add this to

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:15,860
the to the tour configuration in ET c +

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,260
/ EDC it's basically the the let's see

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,960
where is it here

00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,690
the configuration file is called tor RC

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,630
it's not a dot-com for something it's

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:28,330
kind of non-conventional and if we do if

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,310
we just basically uncomment what's

00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:33,340
usually already there if we basically

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:38,380
just right o our port or onion router

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:40,750
port 443 it's going to open a port on

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:47,470
your computer won't be localhost it will

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:49,270
be a an all zero 000 port and allow

00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,280
incoming connections to connect to your

00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:55,690
computer which will serve as a tour

00:15:51,280 --> 00:16:02,140
router and then bounce that along until

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:05,440
it reaches an exit node so and if you do

00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:07,630
this and then if you make this change to

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,300
the tour configuration and then run your

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:12,340
tour program as we did before this is

00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,260
what should come out at the end self

00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,420
testing indicates your or port is

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,130
reachable from the outside so it

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,780
communicates with other tour computers

00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:25,240
to make sure that the connection is is

00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:27,190
is working right installing and

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,130
launching so what we've taken a look at

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:32,710
so far is a little tea tour that's the

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:34,930
basic tor server the service it has no

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,860
human user interface that you can just

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,820
manipulate on the command line and

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,680
doesn't help a lot of people because

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,450
most people want to see something they

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:50,830
can click on when so a few years ago

00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:53,770
tour the Tor project decided that they

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:59,080
would instead of directing people to

00:16:53,770 --> 00:17:02,140
configure their existing web browsers to

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:03,670
use tor as a proxy and they would make

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,400
their own tor browser so what they've

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:08,730
done is actually repackaged the ESR

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,360
version of Firefox or the extended

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:17,230
service release of Firefox which has a

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,420
very long release period and is

00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:22,620
basically Firefox but it's branded tour

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:24,610
and what they call it is a tor browser

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,220
sometimes some people call it tor

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,440
browser bundle or TBB because it

00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:31,150
includes a lot of other things like the

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,840
little tea tour as well

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:38,140
and and the pluggable transports the OB

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:40,150
FS proxy it does a lot of things is

00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,910
basically everything you need to install

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:46,450
on an existing computer in order to

00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:48,100
start using tor right off the bat the

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,770
only difference between the tor browser

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,710
and tales which is what I talked about

00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:55,840
before this USB stick is that the tor

00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,640
browser obviously doesn't have grub and

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,170
things to boot it doesn't have a line

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,200
external it's just something that you

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,030
install on an existing computer tails

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,220
goes a little further one step further

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:09,280
and gives you everything on a USB a live

00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,730
USB image so this is I think one of the

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,440
most one of the most popular projects at

00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,630
the time this is what most people use

00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,710
and is what's recommended because all of

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:23,980
the configuration is done for you so to

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:26,590
get it there's a URL it's pretty easy to

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:31,540
find your search for it and you just

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:33,550
unpack it and you run it right so it's

00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:36,730
just that easy I think we'll take a look

00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:40,230
at that soon and once you do it you get

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,190
this window you have two choices the

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,790
standard choice is to connect

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:49,780
immediately if you do that you will be

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:51,040
connected to the local host running

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:53,650
little tea tour that we looked at before

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,070
and that will connect you onward to

00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:59,140
other torque connected computers and it

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:02,770
will make a circuit and as soon as you

00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,020
send out HTTP requests as you usually do

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:07,690
with a browser those requests will be

00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,970
bounced along the various nodes of the

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:12,760
tour circuit that you have created with

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,550
this connect command now if you think

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,850
that might not work because you're in

00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:21,760
some region some company some protected

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:26,650
network some government that blocks

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,090
connections or or or is yeah it has it

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,540
has a very strange firewall something

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,790
like that then you'll probably need to

00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,130
use a bridge for that and without

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:39,280
getting into too much detail you can

00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,920
configure your tor browser to use

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,830
bridges by using by selecting the second

00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:48,529
option

00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:50,570
so you basically have most cases you can

00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:52,640
cover most cases with just these two

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:55,429
buttons it's the easiest thing to do and

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,460
once you succeed with that then you get

00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:01,820
a basic browser window with Firefox

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:04,010
running under the hood and yeah it's

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,990
usable in most ways there's a few things

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,620
that are more difficult to use with this

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,510
tor browser like cookies third party

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,190
cookies and other abstractions like that

00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:17,419
or there's still some work being done

00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:20,720
but all in all it's a pretty good work

00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:24,080
and a piece of work and and it's not

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,240
slow it's a the added overhead to tour

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:31,130
connections is quite minimal in most

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:34,639
cases you don't notice I haven't I mean

00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,340
there's a debate on that but another a

00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:40,340
few things to notice is that if you do

00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,049
click around look in the menu and so on

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:44,690
you'll find some things that Firefox

00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:47,149
doesn't have these are added features

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:50,649
that the Tor project team has added to

00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:53,090
the firefox ESR which are sometimes

00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:55,460
integrated upstream for the next firefox

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,610
release and sometimes mozilla doesn't

00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:00,740
like to go as far as the team as a tor

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,200
project does so they're only available

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,809
in the tor browser for example the last

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:09,169
release 45 which just came out

00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:11,510
incorporates a security slider which is

00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:13,639
very cool if i remember i'll show to you

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:15,950
it basically you have three or four

00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:18,200
choices you can slide upward you get

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,570
higher security that way and as you move

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:24,110
past each of these three regions you get

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,330
a small highlighted what are they well a

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:29,269
pop-up of some kind which explains to

00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:31,070
you what that region is about if you

00:21:29,269 --> 00:21:33,320
might have problems why you might have

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:38,929
them is very informative very easy to

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:41,539
use so um if you prefer to build tour

00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:46,039
which actually most people do because

00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:47,960
it's so easy is well it's easy to do and

00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:50,360
there's a good reason to that and the

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:53,990
most distributions for example this is a

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,700
open suse they the official distribution

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:59,539
package

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:02,360
an out-of-date version of tour so things

00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:04,610
move pretty quickly and although I'm

00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,370
sure that all of the distributions patch

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:11,240
and re-release for things like heart

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:13,130
bleed or all of the recent ssl problems

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,610
you still might just feel a little

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,950
better using a current release of tour

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:21,950
to do that we just need to download from

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,230
the upstream distribution that's the Tor

00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,389
project org and we have all of these

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,260
different choices and if you'll notice

00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:32,269
open Susie is not there so so I'm kind

00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,750
of hoping that people notice and maybe I

00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:37,850
don't know pay attention to that because

00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:39,230
it's the only linux distribution it's

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:43,940
not there it's too bad so you have to

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:47,179
download the sources like we do with

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:51,669
anything else all right kind of goes off

00:22:47,179 --> 00:22:51,669
the screen there it is

00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:02,320
and so there we are we can just unpack

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:05,230
them very easily and you name what we do

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,740
need on a freshly installed open suse

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:11,919
machine is GCC and make as usual and

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:15,340
then what we need as well to compile

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:19,200
tour we need live at a live event we

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:22,120
need these three dependencies set lib

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:25,679
openssl live event so that's all you

00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:30,240
need is quite quite simple after that

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,240
well let's just why don't we just try it

00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:17,960
it's it's running on a it's running on a

00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:20,690
live USB and I don't see a light on so

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,880
it can't access the hotel hard drive and

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,940
I hope this keeps working because it's

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:27,440
it's in memory I think we're not going

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,590
to be able to do the live demos so

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:36,440
that's a problem in any case so what

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:38,780
will we won't build tour as a demo but

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,210
what it does look like thank goodness I

00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:44,690
wrote it on here you basically configure

00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:48,530
as usual you know it's an auto conf

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:50,870
program so that configure and then it

00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:57,500
gives you all this output and then make

00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:59,960
and what you end up with after it

00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,210
succeeds took me I just did it outside

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:06,820
it took me one minute to build with a

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:06,820
with a notebook three year old notebook

00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:12,320
right and so if you take a look I mean

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:20,750
this is all just kind of peripheral

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:23,240
information these are the main people

00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:25,490
Roger dingledine is the one who invented

00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,230
it so many years ago about 10 years ago

00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:29,230
I guess and

00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:40,640
if you if you install it you can install

00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,340
it anywhere you want I put it in in

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,470
bambey just so that I knew exactly what

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:47,630
was being installed so then I went to

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:53,780
Bambi and I checked it out this is

00:25:47,630 --> 00:26:00,640
everything that you get it's almost the

00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:07,670
same thing as I opensuse package right

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:11,750
right I'm not sure if I want it so so I

00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:15,020
have a hard drive problem I think we're

00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,080
going to skip we're going to come back

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,690
to the demos if because there's a few

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,490
dirty tricks so because there is this

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,340
part which is kind of important this is

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:28,130
what helps to understand how the Tor

00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,200
network works and the routing of the

00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:32,300
packets flowing from a client to a

00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:36,530
server or from a hidden service to

00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,630
client it's very useful its graphical so

00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,040
what we're taking a look at here is

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:42,110
we're taking a look at two people

00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:46,790
actually the only two that are important

00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:49,100
on Alice and Bob in this case and alice

00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:52,450
is going to use a browser to connect to

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,730
Bob service so we have these cool server

00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:58,910
icons there what would normally happen

00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:01,820
is that she would get a clear text

00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:04,280
connection going directly to Bob which

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,770
basically passes all information to the

00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,200
ISP to the routers in between to whoever

00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:11,980
is listening maybe within our own house

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,860
may be parked outside you know

00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:17,660
wardriving with a with a Wi-Fi pineapple

00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:20,210
on top of that whoever is tapped the

00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,800
fiber-optic under the ocean and then the

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:25,280
other governments that she's doing

00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,410
whatever so that's not what she wants

00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,360
and for this reason she's going to use

00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:32,050
the tor browser what the tor browser

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:35,000
will use are all of these tour nodes

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:37,280
which are in the internet parked in

00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,700
various places as we saw you can

00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,100
configure a tor server to become a tour

00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,480
note very easily at or relay to re late

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:50,270
or node

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:54,140
are the same thing the next step what we

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:57,500
have is she connects to the first of

00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:06,080
these tour notes and this is an

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:08,570
encrypted connection I believe it's I'm

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,850
not going to get I don't know which can

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:12,320
encrypt Shin is involved anyway what

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,270
happens after that connects to another

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,910
node so there's three nodes there's

00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:21,470
always three notes involved more than

00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:24,260
three doesn't help and and the last of

00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:26,450
the nodes this is called the exit node

00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:32,320
because that's where the traffic will

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:34,460
actually reach the intended the intended

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,640
destination or recipient of this

00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,460
connection so it's building a circuit

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,270
and it's kind of virtual connection

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,740
through many different computers and

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,809
this circuit can change from time to

00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,470
time it can even change on every single

00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:53,630
request you can configure that the only

00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,820
problem is every time that a circuit is

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,740
built it takes a little while it can

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,620
take a few seconds it can even take 20

00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:06,110
seconds so that's why the circuits are

00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:09,380
we used most often right and that red

00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:12,200
connection here is in the clear so it's

00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,549
not my mouse yet so this is where you

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,100
want to be careful you know that this

00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:18,620
that anybody can be reading this traffic

00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,799
these are encrypted but this one is not

00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:24,020
so what tour typically protects is the

00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:25,700
envelope of your connection of the

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,740
packets traveling in your connection

00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:30,559
it's not really protecting the traffic

00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,960
so if you do want protection in your

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,510
traffic as well you need PGP or some

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,870
kind of encryption for this traffic

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:41,630
hopefully a public key infrastructure

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,460
connection like off the record is

00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:46,370
another good one OTR I think all of the

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,860
others including TLS and ssl I kind of

00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:50,809
broken unfortunately maybe even SSH I

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:55,190
don't know if you guys saw the

00:29:50,809 --> 00:30:00,230
the talks at ccc in hamburg this year

00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:07,340
but jacob appelbaum was one of the main

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:10,159
tour developers wasn't sure if ssh is is

00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:13,549
still ok to use so it's kind of gives

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:18,080
people shakes but if you do this and you

00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:20,480
use a pka I encryption to connect to a

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,840
connection to encrypt this here then you

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,789
should be all right the only thing the

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,799
only over the last of the three steps

00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:30,200
which we can take a look at is if he

00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,090
makes a second connection to a different

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,789
person so now she's connecting to Jane

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:36,499
instead of Bob and it's the same at the

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:40,009
end you have this unencrypted connection

00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:41,840
which is a one hop well it could be it

00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:44,049
could could travel through more routers

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,700
but it will at least go through three

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:49,879
tour nodes this one that one and this

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:52,249
one in this case and this is considered

00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:59,149
a different circuit which makes it all

00:30:52,249 --> 00:31:01,429
the more difficult to trace right and I

00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:03,590
don't have internet and I don't have a

00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:08,119
hard drive some kind of I mean there are

00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:12,950
quite a few online habits that are that

00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:16,100
are kind of important to to change if if

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:19,789
you're going to use tor and be safe for

00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:24,080
example opening documents that you

00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:26,809
receive from a tor network is is not a

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,350
very good idea there have been some

00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:33,080
cases of one of the tour node operators

00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:39,919
manipulating traffic for example another

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:43,070
is a is for example configuring your own

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,899
browser the configuration differences

00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:49,369
between Firefox and the tor browser are

00:31:44,899 --> 00:31:53,629
so much that it's going to be hard to do

00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:55,940
that on your own that's a from memory i

00:31:53,629 --> 00:31:58,779
can't remember all of the online habits

00:31:55,940 --> 00:32:02,480
that are useful to change unfortunately

00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:04,129
but that's running out of time anyway so

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,519
there are some resources that you can

00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:06,080
pay

00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:09,709
tension of if you're interested in doing

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,690
learning more about tour obviously you

00:32:09,709 --> 00:32:13,309
can download it and start using it in

00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:16,580
the easiest way just by using the

00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:18,830
browser the tor browser asking questions

00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,379
there's a lot of people hanging out on

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:24,529
the IRC channel and this is not free

00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:26,179
node this is oft see but it's and I

00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:31,399
think you can you can do an encrypted

00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:33,320
connection as well they're right yeah as

00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:34,639
I'm amazed that the good questions are

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:37,399
always coming over here they should be

00:32:34,639 --> 00:32:41,479
documented I think there is email

00:32:37,399 --> 00:32:42,919
support so there's a few people who are

00:32:41,479 --> 00:32:44,809
dedicating their time to that who are

00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,179
working for the Tor project and answer

00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:49,759
questions and there's even email support

00:32:47,179 --> 00:32:51,109
in different languages so the one that I

00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,749
see the most it's always very

00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:56,379
interesting is there Arabic speaking

00:32:53,749 --> 00:32:59,619
group so a person who speak Arabic and

00:32:56,379 --> 00:33:01,909
works for tour and answers questions

00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:03,320
because I suppose there's a lot of

00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:04,969
problems in the Arabic world with

00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,909
censorship or something that tour

00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:11,509
protects against these slides are online

00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:15,289
right now I believe but I think it's not

00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:18,229
the latest version and there's a QR code

00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:22,700
as well if you want to come up later and

00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:24,559
take a look at them there's a QR code so

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:27,679
i think we have time for questions now

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,749
and if anybody wants asked questions

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,729
later that they didn't remember to ask

00:33:29,749 --> 00:33:33,349
now or doesn't want to ask them publicly

00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:35,599
then I'll leave some business cards up

00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:40,269
here and you can ask me and tomorrow the

00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,269
next day or over email sound good

00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:56,310
any tor users are you tour user yet the

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:59,070
question is is it slower to use tor on

00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,900
my internet connection yes it's slower

00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,210
because it adds overhead as you can

00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,370
imagine every time that a new connection

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,560
is made to one of those tour notes there

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:10,560
has to be a handshake and things going

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:12,840
happening who knows what the what the

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,929
operator is using if it's a Raspberry Pi

00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,820
that has 10,000 connections on it it's

00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:20,639
going to be slow right so but it's very

00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:23,970
variable what you have to do is try it

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,880
and what I believe is that you won't

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:28,860
notice a big difference and what some

00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,530
people do that do notice and they

00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:34,620
complain about it is that they they have

00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:36,690
two profiles in Firefox in the tor

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,960
browser they they have one profile that

00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,090
that bypasses the proxy and so it's just

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,460
sending traffic over the clear and not

00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,460
using the torque network and so that's

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,950
as fast as you could get with your with

00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:53,129
your office or home internet connection

00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:55,020
and the other profile which I don't know

00:34:53,129 --> 00:34:56,970
if they have to reboot or whatever but

00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:59,280
the other profile is set to the Tor

00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:01,650
network so there's various strategies

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,660
and ways to get around whatever problems

00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,850
not only speed is one but sometimes

00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,980
things like Facebook and cookies you

00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:10,820
know there are a few problems that you

00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,820
can usually solve

00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:42,240
that's right so everything using UDP is

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:45,700
not protected by tour there are some

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,500
ways to mitigate that problem by for

00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,810
example what tales does is very

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,330
interesting that if you plug your USB

00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:55,150
stick in just don't do it like I did it

00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,920
but because then you can't access the

00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:01,150
hard drive but if you if you take a

00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:05,500
tails live image and use that I believe

00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:08,650
that it it it will not allow UDP

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,230
connections over the network unless you

00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:14,890
click on something acknowledging that

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,930
you understand that by using UDP you're

00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:21,640
basically screwed tour will not work

00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:25,180
anymore and then the the obvious example

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:29,050
of this like you mentioned is is name

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,730
resolution DNS queries which go over UDP

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:32,920
but it's all kinds of things you know if

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,740
you're doing a VoIP this you know

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:37,420
telephone conversation that's almost

00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,900
certainly going over UDP everything

00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:44,020
media oriented video on demand and so on

00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:46,150
this all UDP so towards not useful to

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,040
solve every problem and unfortunately

00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:52,030
UDP is one of those things which by

00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:54,790
design has no connection and and

00:36:52,030 --> 00:37:00,700
probably won't be solved by tour anytime

00:36:54,790 --> 00:37:04,300
soon we had problems with ICMP isn't is

00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,580
the same problem obviously um and we did

00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:08,230
have problems with IP version 6 as well

00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,270
for a long time but that's been pretty

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:12,790
well ironed out that's been well

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:17,080
developed and tested and so I IP version

00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:20,460
6 works with the Tor network since since

00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,460
a while now a couple years I think

00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,910
you

00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:50,410
yes

00:37:53,330 --> 00:38:01,920
well there's there's no way to know what

00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:03,780
happens at the exit node the in this

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,670
particular situation I'm sorry so that

00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:11,670
the question is how do you know if a

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:15,080
government like or an agency like the

00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:17,460
NSA is operating the exit node and

00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:19,710
monitoring the traffic that flows

00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,990
through that exit node which is your

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:24,450
traffic which you believe to be secure

00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:28,800
but it's being monitored by a government

00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:32,010
organization or agency and it's a hard

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,580
question to answer first of all it would

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:37,830
be pretty difficult for all of the exit

00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:42,750
nodes to be operated by government

00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:45,630
agencies in fact it might not be an

00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:48,990
issue because if they monitor all

00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:51,090
traffic and let's take the worst example

00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:54,060
you're not encrypting anything and it's

00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:57,300
sensitive then the only thing they would

00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,730
know is that it arrived from a person

00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,310
who is not you so you do have that

00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:05,460
protection that is arriving from the

00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:07,170
middle node in this Tor network is not

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,680
arriving from your computer they can't

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:12,810
subpoena your ISP to know who you are

00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:19,670
because you're not the person who sent

00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:22,680
to them that traffic as far as a Content

00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:25,680
it's the part that's unencrypted that's

00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:28,800
why it was that's why it was painted red

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,900
oh I guess well actually that either

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:37,210
means that wait a minute

00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:40,059
I thought that I thought the hard drive

00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:42,970
died and the memory too but the part

00:39:40,059 --> 00:39:44,770
about the content it's kind of your

00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:47,230
responsibility to encrypt the content as

00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,880
well if you want this NSA agency which

00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:51,910
is operating the exit note to not see

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,809
what's inside it's kind of a has

00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:59,109
half-assed answer isn't it another part

00:39:55,809 --> 00:40:01,270
of that there are government agencies

00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:03,400
operating tor exit nodes and they're

00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:05,319
doing that because the military is using

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,849
it and diplomats are using it

00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:11,079
politicians are using it and high-level

00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:12,609
functionaries are using them toward

00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:14,799
network is actually used by governments

00:40:12,609 --> 00:40:19,089
it's extremely important to many many

00:40:14,799 --> 00:40:20,799
governments so and that's where we the

00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:24,130
Tor project gets a lot of its financing

00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:25,990
from as well just to dispel the myths

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,369
that most of the people using tor are

00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,839
criminals or something is just a crazy

00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:31,260
concept when you look at the actual

00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:31,260
users

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,920
again

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:47,030
oh can I tell you some details about

00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:57,200
onion rings the way they taste you mean

00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:59,750
I didn't hear links onion links o dot

00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,589
onion yeah the domain I can tell you a

00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:07,579
few things um well a funny story I was

00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:10,130
in the last RN meeting or in what 35 so

00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:12,770
american Registry of internet numbers

00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:14,930
and they're considering what to do with

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:18,079
onion because actually it's something

00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:23,270
that I Anna and and the the internet

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:26,060
number the managers of Internet numbers

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:28,369
they they didn't produce this dot onion

00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,530
domain right there they they're

00:41:28,369 --> 00:41:33,020
basically managing all of the TLD the

00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,780
top-level domains but dot onion is

00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:40,040
something created by the Tor project and

00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,599
so so how these free registries don't

00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,290
know what to do because it doesn't

00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,380
follow their management procedure now on

00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:52,069
a technical level dot onion is a domain

00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:58,670
which belongs to hidden services and to

00:41:52,069 --> 00:42:01,520
use hidden services yeah it's a typical

00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:06,079
way is that you type into the URL bar of

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:09,290
the of the tor browser a simple URL with

00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,450
a dot onion domain and if you want to

00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,980
know how it's resolved and and these

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:16,970
kind of questions I don't have answers

00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:19,490
to that sorry I'm not so I'm so much an

00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:21,020
expert on hidden services but that's

00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:22,609
what it's about with this domain

00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,369
otherwise you would have to type out

00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:29,569
it's not an IP address it's an insanely

00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:31,940
long I don't know 32 character string of

00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:35,800
it's an identifier for a hidden service

00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,800
and that's what makes it easier
