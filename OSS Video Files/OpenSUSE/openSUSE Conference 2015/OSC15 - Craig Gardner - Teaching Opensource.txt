Title: OSC15 - Craig Gardner - Teaching Opensource
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	How do we get more rock-star programmers in the industry? How do we take our opensource message to the next level? We would do well to start teaching opensource to the young, building their knowledge, interest, and expertise early in the lives of our budding programmers. Opensource principles liberate people, liberate ideas, and liberate code from the oppressive control. Sure, there are industries that may never embrace opensource, but as people become educated regarding the power of opensource, the greater the influence that opensource principles will have over all software engineering practices. As an university instructor, I have some experience to share with how to teach opensource practices to a community.
