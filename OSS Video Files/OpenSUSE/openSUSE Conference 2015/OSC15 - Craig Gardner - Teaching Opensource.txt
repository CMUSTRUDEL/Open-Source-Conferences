Title: OSC15 - Craig Gardner - Teaching Opensource
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	How do we get more rock-star programmers in the industry? How do we take our opensource message to the next level? We would do well to start teaching opensource to the young, building their knowledge, interest, and expertise early in the lives of our budding programmers. Opensource principles liberate people, liberate ideas, and liberate code from the oppressive control. Sure, there are industries that may never embrace opensource, but as people become educated regarding the power of opensource, the greater the influence that opensource principles will have over all software engineering practices. As an university instructor, I have some experience to share with how to teach opensource practices to a community.

short enough that will be just fine my

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,370
name is Craig Gartner I am an employee

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,770
at susa I have been enjoying working on

00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:20,250
the opensuse project since the beginning

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,980
way back in two thousand how long has it

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,570
been a long time in addition to this and

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,840
the many other fun things that i like to

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,660
do i'm also a university instructor a

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,440
professor of software engineering at a

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,660
university nearby my home and as such

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,690
this ends up being a conversation that I

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,550
have with a large number of people

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,250
usually in an academic environment and

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,219
here i am quite out of place talking

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,170
with you who are far more technical

00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:50,250
technical audience than what is normally

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,660
the audience for this kind of a

00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,100
presentation so if you're expecting a

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,230
highly technical presentation this is

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,260
not one of those but it has a very

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:00,180
important connection to you and the

00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,239
things that you and I do on a day-to-day

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,479
basis with opensuse and it with Linux

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,299
and in technology and that is one of the

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,630
challenges we have is finding people

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,490
with the right skills that we can hire

00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,049
them and have them be a part of these

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,600
wonderful communities that we try to

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,210
build too often we have open positions

00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,939
that we can't feel with people who have

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,430
the right qualifications and so this

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,189
discussion that i have on many occasions

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,500
that i've modified for you today is an

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,290
important one and how do we fill the

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,640
pipeline with people that will be

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,890
prepared to take on these

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,670
responsibilities these jobs and solve

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:44,670
these very important very technical jobs

00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:47,189
over a longer period of time and such we

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,720
would need to teach open source in our

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,369
schools today I want to talk about

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,860
primarily these three things that you

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:55,560
see here on the screen about what it

00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:00,149
really means to teach open source or

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,579
even to use open source where we in the

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:05,430
field can make the biggest impact how we

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,320
can make a difference in making sure

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,660
that the right people are entering the

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,390
pipeline and are coming to solve these

00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,830
problems with us and then

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,620
just for a moment about what students

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,840
are ready to learn why open source I

00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,690
don't need to convince you you know why

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:25,410
open source but this is not an obvious

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:29,700
thing in the schools this is a challenge

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:33,510
in the schools schools don't understand

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,810
the value of open source schools don't

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,880
even understand what open source is they

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,410
think oh we just need to teach them

00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,209
about technology we just need to teach

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,310
them a little bit how to program a few

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:47,310
algorithms and throw together a few

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,840
compiled objects and now we've done them

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,830
a service that they can do the right

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,730
things beyond school it's important for

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:59,720
us to note that teaching open source is

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,280
not the same as teaching how to program

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,970
yes programming is important that having

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,519
those students have programming skills

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,830
is critically important no doubt but

00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,920
there's a very specialized knowledge in

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,720
a specialized problem space that we try

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,329
to solve with open source that's not

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,299
immediately obvious to those who are in

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,980
the education fields teaching open

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,730
source is not something that is done

00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,400
widely enough not in the primary and

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:33,120
secondary schools and certainly not in

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,049
the universities you know this we all

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,000
know Richard Stallman and his original

00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,070
drive to to create a definition for what

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,079
free software is and the values that are

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:44,790
all incorporated into that and and of

00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:47,040
course we all have fun engaging

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:48,690
passionate arguments about what this

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,209
means and not all of us agree with

00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,130
Richard and not everyone has the same

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,959
idea of what it means to have open

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,989
source but we can at least latch on to

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,049
these kinds of principles it's not just

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:05,120
about creating free software in the free

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:09,810
beer sense right it's about liberation

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:13,170
it's about freedom it's about opening

00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,560
minds and opening opportunities in ways

00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:18,690
that a narrow proprietary thought

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,989
doesn't cover so at least we can latch

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,990
onto that the challenge is that

00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:27,720
universities and other

00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:33,460
kinds of schools don't understand this

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:35,169
we have the opportunity to to to teach

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,970
students about software and that

00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:38,979
software is an important technological

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:43,389
advance but intention technology allows

00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:47,080
us to to solve interesting problems but

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:50,440
schools are focused on getting students

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,000
prepared for a job market and typically

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,110
when you talk about preparing students

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,380
for a job market you're talking about

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:01,030
fying being a paying job which runs a

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,919
little bit counter at least it is

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:08,830
somewhat counterintuitive to what open

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,280
source seems to be to this audience of

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:14,919
educators oh these open source people

00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,979
they just do all this stuff for free as

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,360
hobbyists on the side whatever spare

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,099
time that they have they do it because

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,710
they're passionate about software and

00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:25,150
you can't make any money doing that in

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,550
fact that's one of the most common

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,590
questions I get when I'm wandering

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,840
through the schools or wandering through

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,699
other places of employment they say who

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,440
you work for Souza how does your company

00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:40,000
make any money don't you just write free

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,860
software and changing that mentality and

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,289
changing that understanding of what open

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,530
source is about is a challenge that we

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:49,719
have so the schools have a difficulty

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:52,509
getting the students to understand that

00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:55,539
there's more about free software than

00:05:52,509 --> 00:06:00,389
just finding a paying job but that it

00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:02,590
also helps you to find a paying job

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:04,360
other things that are important to

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,009
understand is that most of the way that

00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,690
our schools work is that they are funded

00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:13,090
publicly by governments and so the

00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,039
schools are compelled to do what their

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,979
governments tell them to do to to meet

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,539
certain accreditation requirements to

00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:20,469
just get the students through school and

00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:22,210
to learn the things that the

00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,860
accreditation and government

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:25,990
organizations tell them they're supposed

00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,580
to be teaching the students governments

00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:30,630
don't understand free software

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,510
governments don't understand open source

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:35,970
and so getting schools to understand

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,490
that from an industrial perspective is a

00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,530
challenge and they're funded by those

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,550
taxes and when they are not funded by

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,060
those taxes they're funded by

00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:47,400
corporations that have an abundance of

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,620
money to influence those schools to

00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,960
teach the things that the corporations

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,180
think they should now that works to a

00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,450
certain extent to an industrial

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,160
advantage but only to the advantage of

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,290
those that have the money to spend at

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,920
that level and that's where you see so

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:06,150
much of the Microsoft influence

00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,580
permeating the educational structures

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,290
they're willing to go in and give

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:15,600
schools hardware and give schools free

00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:19,680
microsoft software to further their

00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,200
purposes we could learn from this but

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,090
it's an expensive endeavor and one that

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,270
we're not typically willing to invest a

00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,500
great deal of money to do yes you have

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,240
certain investments that come into

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,360
education from the likes of Oracle and

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,080
even our friends at Red Hat small though

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,290
their donations maybe spend at least

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,980
some effort to get into the university

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:47,250
curricula so that they can have some

00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:48,930
influence there which is good and as I

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,250
mentioned earlier most schools simply

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,090
just don't understand what open sources

00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,950
about and they have limited resources

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,180
they have limited time they've got to

00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,740
get these students through the

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,810
curriculum just as quickly as they can

00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,840
learning just the basics that they need

00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,980
to enough that they can be certified as

00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,930
having some knowledge for their

00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:09,660
baccalaureate degree but never a whole

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:11,640
really enriching understanding of what's

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,640
involved in a software engineering

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,620
endeavor that involves open source hence

00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:19,110
teaching is typically pattern according

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,120
to a proprietary model and model that is

00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,150
very closed a model that is very

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:28,320
programmatic and not very liberating Lee

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:30,680
open furthermore I wish to make two

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:32,729
important points that's broken about

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,530
education systems and it's not that this

00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,820
is not that our education systems are

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,169
bad and we're doing a good job of

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,849
teaching students and we're trying to

00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:41,250
teach them the right things but there's

00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,190
just a simple challenge

00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:45,930
with teaching that's not consistent with

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:50,430
the kinds of things that we try to do in

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:52,800
open source number one it's important in

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:55,830
a Formica schools perspective to assert

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,540
that an individual has mastered some

00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,700
knowledge in this particular thing and

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,650
you can't assert that a student has

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,920
learned those particular things in a

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,770
collaborative environment you have to

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:09,600
say Jimmy has learned how to do this

00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,610
because I watched him do this by himself

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,140
he could write this algorithm and he

00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,820
knows how the compiler works and he

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,080
knows how to build an interpreter and he

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,340
knows what's involved in an operating

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,620
system because he's proved this as an

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:24,290
individual and so there's not much

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:27,240
collaboration and collaboration is

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,790
avoided because it's considered to be

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,400
cheating if Marcus does all of the work

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,630
and my team project I can only tell that

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,800
he learned it and not any other other

00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,660
people on the team that we're working

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,760
with Marcus the second thing that's

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:40,710
challenging is that you're taught that

00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,150
you need to write your code from scratch

00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,580
which is good that's important we need

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,980
to have good programmers who know how to

00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,110
write good algorithms and good logic and

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,240
good constructs and good object-oriented

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,790
characteristics we need to have all of

00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,800
these things but you are too often in a

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:02,010
school environment told you cannot reuse

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:06,450
code and yet that's what you and I do

00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:09,930
all day every day and there's value in

00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,420
that the education model doesn't fact

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,870
that so somehow we need to convince

00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:18,000
educators that it's okay to borrow other

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,280
people's code and it's okay to teach

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,160
people how to collaborate on how to work

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:25,980
in a collaborative environment so that's

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,990
the hard part exposing students to open

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,170
source is easy oh look here's some open

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,940
source code but teaching them how to do

00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:36,150
it and how to contribute and how to

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,700
collaborate in this way is the hard part

00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:41,100
which leads us to some hurdles if you'll

00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:45,060
forgive me a quick metaphor hurdles are

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,040
are an interesting beast it's easy to

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,500
run right we all just basically fall

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:53,940
forward in a very controlled rapid pace

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,960
but getting to the point where you're

00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,810
trying to

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,320
run and leap at the same time is not at

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,490
all natural to do it's a very awkward

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,300
motion that you have to go through and

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:09,870
when you get it wrong it hurts when you

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:12,270
trip and fall it hurts so you have these

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,070
kinds of situations you've got people

00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,840
that trip over the hurdles you've seen

00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,450
these images from the Olympics these are

00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,840
great this happens to be a steeplechase

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:24,150
hurtling event in my hometown here of

00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,870
provo utah brigham young university and

00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,940
boy that hurts and then there's this

00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:32,670
kind of situation when you hurdle and

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,040
don't quite make it over yeah that's not

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:37,080
very appealing is it and too often we

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,750
have these kinds of situations as people

00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,920
trying to break into this open-source

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,590
collaborative model this is not

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:45,570
universally true but it is generally

00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:47,700
true lots of research and lots of

00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:50,070
documentation that goes into this about

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:52,290
how challenging it is for people to

00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,150
enter into this realm of open source who

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,750
haven't had any experience and to be

00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:59,880
honest we don't make it easy for them

00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:03,780
it's hard to meet those standards that

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,720
we in our knowledge domains have to let

00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,400
new people in and begin contributing so

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,750
let's carry on with the rest of this

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,700
metaphor we've talked about hurtling

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:14,040
programming by itself turns out to be

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:16,560
generally easy telling a computer what

00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:19,050
to do is not such a hard things yes you

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,920
need some important skills to do it but

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:21,960
we can do that and we're fairly

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,330
successful teaching students how to

00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,910
program but contributing doesn't come

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,350
naturally to people it's an awkward

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,060
motion contributing to open source is a

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:31,500
challenge and understanding all of the

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,480
idiosyncrasies that are involved in each

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,360
of the various communities to where you

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,870
can be a collaborator in that community

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,400
is hard and it hurts when you fail where

00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,860
can we make the biggest difference then

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,080
where can we as an already converted

00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,760
already accepted a member of the

00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,550
opensuse community we're going to do a

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:54,590
couple of points I would like to make

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:57,630
start young in places in Asia China

00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:59,910
Taiwan they start teaching their

00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:03,279
children to program in their schools in

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:06,129
the third grade class three

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:09,970
in the United States first of all

00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:12,519
there's not a whole organized program of

00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,430
getting students to program those

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:19,089
students who are programming in Thailand

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,850
in the sixth grade are outperforming the

00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:26,170
students in the United States who are in

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:28,930
the 11th grade on standardized tests for

00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,249
programming we would do well to start a

00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,620
little bit younger so that we have those

00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:34,779
skills those programming skills earlier

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,579
on and then we can concentrate on more

00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:40,860
of the social the more collaborative

00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:44,949
aspects the more open source focus of

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:49,029
engineering in the more disciplined ages

00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:50,620
of secondary schools the 16 year olds

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:53,949
and the 18 year olds and then into the

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,470
college years or now they have that

00:13:53,949 --> 00:13:58,689
capacity that ability to do more

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:01,899
collaborative work eighty-eight percent

00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:06,009
of global businesses worldwide can't

00:14:01,899 --> 00:14:08,889
fill all of their positions now this is

00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:10,569
a general statement not necessarily to

00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:13,839
do with open source but it is where

00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:18,370
we're still having a huge need without

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,620
enough of a skill base the people that

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:24,370
can fill these jobs these jobs go

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:27,339
unfilled and companies limp along

00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:28,689
without the talent that they need to

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:31,509
solve the problems that they're trying

00:14:28,689 --> 00:14:33,819
to solve that comes from the Linux

00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:36,220
Foundation right there and we need to

00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:39,309
establish a fairly well defined pipeline

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,319
the future depends on having an earlier

00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,689
start for those students and getting

00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:46,629
them collaborating earlier and

00:14:43,689 --> 00:14:48,129
understanding the paradigm earlier it's

00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:50,019
harder to train them to do these things

00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:52,269
if they're only starting to learn these

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:54,699
things when they're in college they have

00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:56,439
a much easier way of understanding how

00:14:54,699 --> 00:14:58,660
to collaborate how to play nice with the

00:14:56,439 --> 00:15:03,429
other children in the playground when

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:06,009
they're in these earlier years as I

00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:07,600
mentioned earlier schools follow the

00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:08,420
money the schools will do what the money

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,970
tells that

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:13,100
to do otherwise they won't get the money

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,560
right so if the government is telling

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,480
them this is what you need to do then

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:20,000
that's what they will do to get the tax

00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,230
money that they need and if they need to

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,970
have supplemental money that the

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,959
government won't give them where do they

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:29,839
look for it they get it from industry or

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,820
they do without and that's where we can

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,750
start making a difference in our

00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,930
collective industries in our collective

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:42,740
companies which is where we need to go

00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,870
visit our local schools you need to go

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,079
visit the schools where your children

00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:50,149
are going to school you need to go visit

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,160
your alma mater where you graduated from

00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,050
University and talk with them and say

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,690
you know I got a great education here

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,519
and I value that you got me through this

00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,130
program here what a wonderful school

00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:05,120
this is now let me tell you why don't

00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:06,980
you teach open source incorporate this

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,510
into your program see the kinds of

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,250
things that I am doing today and the

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,470
value that it has for me and how it got

00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,870
me into this job in this career and this

00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,760
kind of work that I do if you were to

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,579
teach this here at the University that I

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,760
love so much we would have greater

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,990
success you would have greater success

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,070
this is the approach that we need to

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,209
take a grassroots approach of us

00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,310
injecting ourselves into the

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,790
conversation about what is taught and

00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:36,320
what the value is of it being talked you

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:38,060
need to talk with the teachers of your

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
stub your students and it takes a little

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,550
bit of a donation of time but you're

00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,079
familiar with that already that's what

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,350
open sources about right you do a little

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,610
bit on your own because you're

00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:50,089
passionate about it because it's

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:51,890
meaningful to you spending a little time

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:55,220
to have these kinds of conversations in

00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,860
the schools it's valuable preparing

00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,829
students to contribute well this is what

00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:03,500
we need to do to get them that kind of a

00:17:00,829 --> 00:17:04,819
collaborative open source education of

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,319
course we start with programming we

00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:08,270
don't change that maybe we do things a

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,400
little bit earlier but you have to have

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,809
that foundation of being able to program

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,520
and once you know how to program a

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:14,600
little bit then you start to help these

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,189
students to understand that it's not

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,079
just about knowing how to write a bubble

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:19,089
sort

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:20,679
you're writing this code because you

00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:23,189
need to solve a problem and so you need

00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:27,459
to get the students as early as you can

00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:30,340
solving real problems and how do you do

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:33,250
that well you start encouraging them to

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:36,340
team program not just as individuals and

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,620
then you get them to oh sorry that's

00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:41,110
probably on the next slide I'm sorry you

00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,760
need to get them looking at existing

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,320
hope open-source projects and get them

00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,880
interested in what's going on with their

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,590
is there an open source project that's

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,710
out there that solves an interest that

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,510
you have as a student and get you at

00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,010
least examining what's going on with an

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,409
open source project and ideally then

00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,480
starting to contribute to that open

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,490
source project what's going on with this

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,990
source code here that's something that's

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,120
meaningful to you that maybe you could

00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,620
change that you could adapt that you

00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,090
could fix a bug you could add a new

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,289
feature or perhaps contribute to the

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,510
documentation so that it's

00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:12,010
understandable to everybody getting

00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:16,179
those students to collaborate on

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:20,080
existing code for existing projects and

00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:22,409
to solve real problems goes a long way

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,360
to getting them where they need to be

00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:29,409
contributing at the time when it matters

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,799
as they enter the workplace make an open

00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:34,269
source project is school assignment now

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,950
there are some universities that are

00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:37,840
starting to toy with this but not enough

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,450
of them and certainly there are some

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,210
passionate educators in very small

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,769
numbers in very distributed ways that

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,809
are trying to do these kinds of things

00:18:44,769 --> 00:18:49,690
and we're talking together we all are

00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:51,730
trying to encourage each other and learn

00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:54,820
from each other in this community of

00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,409
educators to enhance this to use open

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,940
source projects as a basis for the

00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:03,070
curriculum prepare them for 60 and I

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,260
skip this important point that I had

00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:09,100
here it's also important for them to

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:13,539
understand that failure is not a bad

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:20,549
they too often in our schools we say oh

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:23,799
you did that wrong fail you don't pass

00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:26,740
but solving challenging problems is all

00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:28,090
about seeing that that doesn't work and

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,860
that doesn't work and that doesn't work

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,210
as well and maybe this almost kind of

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,640
work but at least I learned from it and

00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:36,280
having this collective progressive

00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,650
learning experience to where mass

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,860
failure intelligent fast failure

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:44,169
contributes to success trying to teach

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:48,909
students that failure is a pathway to

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:51,130
success is important and that those

00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:53,559
failures sometimes are a little painful

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:57,190
but that which does not kill me makes me

00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,049
stronger so we get to the point where

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:01,000
we've failed a few times and we've

00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:03,580
stumbled and we've heard our knees and

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,260
we've made a bloody mess on the ground

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,120
because of the Falls that we have made

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,590
but we eventually get to where we

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,440
understand the mechanics and we are able

00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:15,460
to not just run but to also hurdle and

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,530
to have success and to hurdle things and

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,549
to contribute in open-source ways like a

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:23,650
boss such as this beautiful very

00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:26,409
excellent form that these ladies have

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,240
jumping over this world hurdle or if you

00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:30,400
are an American football fan to where

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,500
you can hurdle over your obstacles with

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,240
no trouble at all but of course no one

00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:37,120
here is an American football fan right

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,159
and we're in the Netherlands and so this

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:43,110
will be meaningful to you Robin van

00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:45,720
Persie we can score goals like this

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:49,690
because of the skills that we have

00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,610
leaving the educational institution keys

00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,190
to success five things as a takeaway to

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,470
this particular discussion that we have

00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,700
we need to teach applicable skills yes

00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,960
knowing how to do a bubble sort is

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,549
important learning how to program as

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,610
important but getting them to where they

00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:05,830
understand how do you use git how do i

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,659
collaborate with my friends worldwide

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:10,390
how do I work in a team environment how

00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:12,700
do I use what my teammate has done and

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,400
build upon it and not have to redo

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,630
everything that my teammate does

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,030
applicable collaborative

00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:22,490
skills number to give students an

00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:26,680
opportunity to use those skills and to

00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:29,870
validate them with actual open source

00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,730
projects number three teach students how

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:33,770
to collaborate teach them how to

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:38,590
communicate teach them how to exchange

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,590
code teach them how to exchange ideas

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:45,140
number four get students who exposed to

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:47,630
the communities that are interesting to

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,790
them getting them working on something

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:52,970
that's boring or that does not interest

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:54,230
them is a dead end but getting them

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:55,940
working on stuff that is really

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,700
meaningful to them such as me I work on

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:02,210
the muse score open source project

00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:05,480
because I value that I lead and arrange

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,970
choral music and so being able to have

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,600
an open source project that makes

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:14,750
beautiful music spread sheet music

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,600
scores sheet music is valuable to me and

00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:19,400
that's why I contribute to it doing the

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,390
same sort of thing to students to where

00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,610
they're working on something that's

00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,580
valuable to them will yield great

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,260
rewards and then it's also important

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:29,240
that's easy for me to say this because I

00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:33,620
come from it the land where English is

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:37,040
the native tongue but you know so well

00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:38,990
that the way to collaborate in a global

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,660
environment today our open source

00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:44,510
environment is it not exclusive that we

00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:48,640
learn English but it is important that

00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:51,140
we have those kinds of skills that

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:53,190
provides a real leg up in our

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,490
collaborative capabilities

00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:58,320
so we have a lot to do there's a long

00:22:56,490 --> 00:23:00,960
way to go and there are many problems

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,090
yet to be solved but the more that we

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,680
have this kind of a community who

00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,850
understands this problem space because

00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:11,670
you've been true this is very valuable

00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:15,630
in our setting our feet on the ground

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:18,390
and going out and helping those who can

00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:21,840
solve the problem in the institutions in

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:24,450
the schools will go a long way to

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,330
solving our problems will be solving

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,310
more important more challenging problems

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,100
with the technology that we are creating

00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:35,940
and we'll be able to fill the jobs that

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,160
need to be filled I appreciate your time

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,690
I'm grateful for the efforts that you go

00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,910
through in the open source community and

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,690
I'm glad that I can call you friends can

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:44,690
I answer any of your questions

00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:55,110
is there an ax and you say any

00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,530
meaningful lobby or organization that

00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,930
supports open source in schools a lobby

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,050
to support the schools there is no

00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:08,610
formal lobby for this surely there are

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:11,430
some very passively interested entities

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,470
that have some influence with with the

00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:15,690
government from the legislative

00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:18,660
perspective but there's no formal lobby

00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:21,090
for it some of them the best work that

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:24,980
goes on that tries to influence though

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:28,350
comes from our friends at Red Hat yeah

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:33,320
we should form a formal lobby for this

00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:33,320
that's a great idea thank you

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:39,170
if you're already experienced with using

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,180
github for students and the

00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:44,330
contributions to open source project I

00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:47,450
have yes at a university level I require

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:49,490
my students in the class that I teach to

00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,880
collaborate on github and they do that

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:55,850
for a variety of assignments that they

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,380
have for my class and then I encourage

00:24:55,850 --> 00:25:01,730
them to use that for other class work

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:04,300
that they do but having that kind of get

00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:08,030
experience for a high school student

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,800
doesn't work very well we need to change

00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,180
that to where they have a better

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,340
understanding of what that all is

00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:15,800
earlier on in their life so that then it

00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,050
could be meaningful at a younger age but

00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,640
right now as I go into a high school and

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:24,130
have this kind of discussion with them

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:28,730
they any version control is still very

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:33,070
foreign to them good question other

00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:33,070
questions address

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:41,210
you should have the microphone address

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:45,090
thank you I wonder if you want to

00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,420
promote students and professors using

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:50,730
real open source projects to show and

00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:52,820
engage their students in whether it

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:56,700
might be a first step to promote

00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:59,370
teachers actually using more open source

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,100
software in their daily rare like for

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,010
instance is there any initiative

00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:07,440
promoting the use of libre office /

00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:09,030
microsoft office or things you know like

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,820
that helps them with i don't know

00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:13,380
entering grades or administering things

00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,150
in these sort of level you know it so

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,160
that they get used to actually working

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,170
with those upstream projects and that it

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,360
becomes a natural step to also you know

00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:24,030
not just do that specifically for one

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,300
class but just out of their daily like

00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:28,980
workflows that's a great question and

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,860
because i am at what's called an adjunct

00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:34,470
instructor i'm not a full-time faculty

00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,060
member in the school and so there's only

00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,400
a little bit that they listen to me so

00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:42,450
my influence is not quite as great and

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:44,370
and although i will make suggestions to

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,420
go that kind of direction that the head

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:50,970
of the department hears and understands

00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,860
the faculty as a whole if they don't

00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:54,720
know it if they still haven't lived it

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,870
if that hasn't been a part of their

00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,480
training it's hard for them to latch on

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:02,370
to it as well for example this is not an

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,230
open source situation but it's entirely

00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:08,730
applicable to this question that you

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:12,020
have I have a faculty member on at my

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:16,320
university who still teaches Java 5

00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:18,780
which is good that's fine it's not up to

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,520
date because he's not up to date he

00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,100
doesn't he hasn't made that transition

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,770
he hasn't grown along with the

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:30,840
technology so he's kind of a little

00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:33,360
behind he teaches what he knows and if

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,100
the teachers don't know about what it

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,330
means to be involved in open source it's

00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,610
hard for them to teach it to the

00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,950
students so another colleague of mine

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:41,430
John Jolley probably some of you who

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,130
work in

00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:46,380
sousa know who John Jolley is he's our

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:48,630
Colonel hacker he works on the s390

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,000
Colonel infra no fed he also is an

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,130
instructor at the same University and he

00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,920
and I both are trying very hard to

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:58,860
convince the faculty of the value of

00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,960
this which then has a downhill effect of

00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:04,110
spreading to the rest of the students

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,380
absolutely true hundreds other thoughts

00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:06,380
or questions

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,850
good thank you very much for your time

00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:14,970
enjoy your lunch and enjoy the rest of

00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,970
