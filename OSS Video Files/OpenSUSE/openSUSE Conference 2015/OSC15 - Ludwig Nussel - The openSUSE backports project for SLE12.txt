Title: OSC15 - Ludwig Nussel - The openSUSE backports project for SLE12
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	SUSE Linux Enterprise is the work horse for mission-critical Linux use. The operating system and selected major components on top are maintained and supported via SUSE's commercial offering. The openSUSE project on the other hand provides thousands of free and open source software packages maintained by volunteers via openSUSE Tumbleweed. Many openSUSE contributors also run SLE in production and would like to have their packages available for SLE. The openSUSE build service makes that easily possible but so far a central repository to collect all package builds for SLE was missing. The openSUSE backports project aims to provide such a central repo. This talk outlines the goals and policies of the openSUSE backports project and explains the technical setup in OBS as well as the workflow for contributors.
