Title: OSC15 - Bron Gondwana - Cyrus Foundation and JMAP protocol
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The Cyrus IMAPd server is one of the oldest open email servers, and after a few quiet years, we're making good progress towards releasing a revialised 3.0 at OSCON in Portland this July.

I'll be talking about the history of Cyrus and the project, outlining what's new, releasing the first alpha of the 3.0 release, and asking for help and feedback.

I will also talk about the new JMAP protocol to replace IMAP, SMTP, CardDAV and CalDAV - which will be included in this release.
