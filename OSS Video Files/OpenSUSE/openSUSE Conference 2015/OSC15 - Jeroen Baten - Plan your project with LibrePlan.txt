Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Business and Outcome track: LibrePlan is a collaborative tool to plan, monitor and control projects and has a rich web interface which provides a desktop alike user experience. All the team members can take part in the planning and this makes possible to have a real-time planning .
LibrePlan is open source and you can download, install and customize it for free. It is usual that you need to manage more than one project at a time, with resources that participate in several projects. LibrePlan was designed thinking of these scenarios where multiple projects and resources interact to carry out the work inside a company. It is common that some of the data needed by planning tools are stored in other applications of the IT infrastructure. When this is the case, if you reuse this shared data you save both time and money by avoiding to insert them manually in two different points. LibrePlan makes this sharing possible by providing a wide set of web services to import and export data.

LibrePlan is an open source project planning application. In this talk we will show you how it works and why you need it. We also tell you when you don't need to.
