Title: OSC15 - Douglas DeMaio - Why Branding Matters
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Organizations should be designed to endure but can only do so through strong core activities and a strong brand. The open source community might not view branding as important, but there are reason to have consistent branding. From Mozilla to Libre Office or VLC to Blender, successful open source projects have created consistency with branding and messaging of products and services. This presentation will describe why branding is important and how the open-source communities can strike a balance of power between community efforts and branding needs.

	00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:11,090
yeah um started all right so I'm going

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,690
to talk about branding and I'm going to

00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:17,730
give a brief overview of the history to

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,820
take a look right there how branding is

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,650
evolved there's a little bit confusion I

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,390
guess between advertisement and branding

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:29,460
but I'll explain that as we go the

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,920
evolution of a brand how brands have

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,100
developed with different companies with

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,890
different open source projects brain

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:45,420
control how can we better control our

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:48,180
brand and give people a sense of I guess

00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,449
a feeling but i'll i'll get more to that

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,899
later on and i have some other sides

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:55,949
that will help bring that message out

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:59,430
then we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:03,080
about opensuse and how our brand is

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:07,100
perceived I guess and how we actually

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:12,180
the reality of open susan how we look to

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:15,479
you and to users out there and then what

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,180
can we do to achieve a better brain so

00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:22,200
the history branding we look at branding

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:28,350
over time we could think about things

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:32,820
are branded people have been branded the

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:35,340
symbol they're sort of the dominant the

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,040
master I was looking for the symbol for

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,420
the slave there was one but I just

00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:45,810
couldn't figure out which one it was so

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,780
branding has a long history and it's

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:53,280
very important because well people

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:58,079
identify with it and I guess if we look

00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:02,250
at branding as we come to know it a

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:06,960
little bit or how its evolved around the

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:10,590
time of the printing press so gutenberg

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,700
i believe it was when they started to

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,430
print

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:18,260
that's when you really saw images kind

00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:21,269
of come together and people had

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:26,540
something that was identifiable as a

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:26,540
product is something you could trust so

00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:38,069
moving on I want to show you this video

00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:44,640
I had it in the slide but apparently

00:02:38,069 --> 00:02:47,010
it's not working there's nothing big and

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,709
dramatic about this it's actually pretty

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:56,790
simple but first television America runs

00:02:52,709 --> 00:03:02,849
on bulova time so that that was the very

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:13,370
first commercial and obviously things

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:13,370
have developed over time and with it

00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:24,939
okay hey how you doing it's superbowl

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:27,189
time again where I'm solutely anybody

00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:29,049
but the next to 4.5 million bucks to

00:03:27,189 --> 00:03:39,780
spend okay so good show we can see it

00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:39,780
evolved like that let's go back here and

00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:52,959
okay 1994 the internet sort of changed

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,700
changed I guess the way branding has

00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:03,340
become if you look between the printing

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:09,780
press and then TV there there was some

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:12,849
brand identity things have evolved and

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,829
TV to the internet you can see this was

00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:18,940
really the first this is actually the

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:23,800
first advertisement and that really

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:28,479
drove a lot of people to think about

00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:33,970
what they can do think about how they

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:39,360
can brand something and this isn't this

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:41,520
isn't like the the best I guess way of

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,849
identifying with something but it

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,940
allowed for opportunity and if you look

00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:50,500
at social marketing and how you can how

00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:54,130
you do branding with social marketing

00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,389
we're talking advertisement that is set

00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:01,930
to grow to 8 11 billion dollar industry

00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:05,590
which is quite amazing so how brands

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,099
have evolved take coca coca cola for

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:08,099
example

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:18,010
you can see that somewhere there in the

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:21,040
early 1900s their brand has developed to

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:26,740
where it is today it's not that far off

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:30,160
it's actually pretty similar no they had

00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:34,570
some problem there in 85 I don't know if

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,790
any of you remember how in 1985 I think

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,020
they said the new coke it was or

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:45,300
something like that and that really had

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:47,680
a dramatic effect they had no idea how

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,570
how much of an audience they hadn't how

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,660
upset they were when they actually

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:54,010
changed the brand's keep keep pointing

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,640
thinking about that when you do

00:05:54,010 --> 00:06:01,720
something with brands you have the

00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:05,280
possibility of damaging the relationship

00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:10,870
that you have with a consumer okay um

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:15,490
look it's ivory you can see it started

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:19,210
out in early or late in 1808 1900s and

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:23,310
they were pretty consistent with their

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:26,050
with their branding and if you look at

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,000
1965 I don't know europe I'm not really

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,740
sure if they sell ivory here but in the

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,530
states they don't okay the nineteen

00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:40,120
eighty or nineteen sixty-five brand it's

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:41,950
very similar still today so you can see

00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,440
it very it evolved over time but it was

00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:46,630
pretty consistent all right we'll take

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,430
shell for an example we all know who

00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:55,600
jelas assume and you look and see how

00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:58,420
their brand has evolved and you have to

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:03,340
make change and and change is important

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:07,960
because you you need to move forward

00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:13,780
right and at some point you might find

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:17,290
exactly what what it is that resonates

00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:21,199
with your consumers or resonates with

00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:26,040
the people that are using your product

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:33,570
so we'll move on to technology branding

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:35,970
and technology dramatic change in a very

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:39,120
short period of time when you go back to

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:41,009
the other slide beforehand those were

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,410
much older but this is this is fairly

00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:52,350
newer you can see how far apples come

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:54,449
from 76 or Microsoft from well 85 and

00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:58,800
there was probably a lot of discussions

00:07:54,449 --> 00:08:02,570
about the logo and about how people can

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:07,080
see something and identify with it and

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:12,210
I'm sure that you know they're there

00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:17,520
were some voices that were very loud but

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:21,570
in the end they do they've kind of stuck

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,490
to a theme you know when you look at the

00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:27,930
boxes you look at the colors it's all

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:33,060
the same Apple we obviously see there

00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:37,979
was a problem toward the later half

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:39,419
there that 1998 they were stagnant they

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,450
needed a change they needed to move

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:46,260
forward and they brought Steve Jobs back

00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:49,920
and that new logo really represented a

00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:55,230
big change for the company and if you

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:58,620
think about that time frame um excuse me

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:11,550
I'm gonna drink a beer cuz why i'm a

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:17,250
little hungover you do thanks all right

00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:19,320
so when the ipod came out when itunes

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:21,000
came out it was right around that time

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,920
and it was big dramatic change but they

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,990
needed to do something to actually move

00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,040
forward they needed to show they were

00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,040
changing all right

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:39,200
open source Brandon all right I couldn't

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,160
really find that many open-source

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,290
projects that have actually had

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,940
evolution with their logo not so many I

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:54,529
mean they all seem to be the same that

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:58,010
they were when they started so but month

00:09:54,529 --> 00:10:03,290
Mozilla has evolved a little bit yeah

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:07,670
and event re new you involved with the

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,080
Mozilla project of Firefox at all so I

00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,149
would be interested to hear what you

00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,790
have to say if you are involved with it

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:16,820
how that might have trend transitioned

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,649
or been worked out within the company

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,050
what they thought or within the project

00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:27,529
what they thought they needed to do to

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:30,529
update the brand and perhaps you've all

00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:32,120
been a part of open source for a long

00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:36,470
time so maybe you could actually think

00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:38,870
to yourself how certain periods of time

00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:42,020
where you know Firefox had actually

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:48,970
excelled were they all the sudden became

00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:51,610
a project that was you know somewhat

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:55,580
somewhat small to all the sudden being a

00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:59,150
big project a big something that's well

00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:02,060
known a lot of people will use Firefox I

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:09,050
think the first time I used it was moved

00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:10,279
probably 2007 so you know I was a little

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,910
bit behind the time from when they

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:17,930
started but but when you change when you

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:21,079
change a logo you change perception you

00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:25,730
change you get more people talking about

00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:28,329
it and that brings awareness okay so

00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:28,329
brain control

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:37,810
last year if any of you were in

00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:40,490
Dubrovnik ken bomber actually did a

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:43,000
brought out some branding guidelines and

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:49,189
this I think was a big step for our

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,430
project it was important because it

00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:55,100
allows some consistency I know that you

00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,569
know you want it with open source you

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:00,430
kind of want to give people the freedom

00:11:56,569 --> 00:12:03,550
to make what they think the project is

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,779
but it's always good to have some

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,389
limitations so that you're actually all

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:11,060
coming together and your your branding

00:12:08,389 --> 00:12:15,649
your branding the organization

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:17,329
consistently right and believe it or not

00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:20,899
these things actually do matter when you

00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:23,870
get into placing things in a certain

00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:27,079
point on your website it when you have

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:30,920
guidelines and structures you know you

00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:33,889
have a the same font you have the logo

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,990
is always in the same location these

00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:42,470
things actually do matter right colors

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:47,870
impact a person that's actually looking

00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:52,699
at a logo website whatever you know do

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:56,360
you want your brand to be red and flashy

00:12:52,699 --> 00:13:01,220
you know old you know we're green you

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:04,279
know we're friendly we're we're we're

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:08,120
more of a and green obviously is a

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:12,199
natural color so so so things are more

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,449
perceived as more natural with with our

00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:20,079
brand probably than will say red hat

00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:20,079
yeah okay

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:30,269
so this is a bit interesting and since

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,019
I've been here I've really thought about

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:39,569
how is going to present this and I had

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:44,309
the original idea of well the idea that

00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:49,970
our project and the various tools we

00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:53,279
have there's a little bit of a

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,790
difference and that is if you look at

00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:01,279
say our open build service you have the

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:03,269
open build service brand and you know

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,019
you're not really sure if it's an

00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:11,309
opensuse project those who are in it do

00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:14,639
but those who are not might not know

00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:18,119
that and that has some advantages and it

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,779
has some disadvantages but that's

00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:24,360
something that I think we need to think

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,490
about as an organization how do we want

00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,089
to tie things together but also keep

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:32,100
that separation that is important for

00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:35,720
something like the open build service

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:40,290
which would be used by several different

00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:45,480
open source projects so you can notice

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:49,439
sent to us and fedora yeah they're their

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:52,529
logos are very different there's not

00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:54,689
much I mean I guess everyone knows that

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,279
they're sort of the under the red hat

00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,920
umbrella but they're they're almost

00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,279
their own projects in a sense and if you

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:05,370
look at kubuntu and ubuntu you can see

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:08,220
the circle on the on the upper right of

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:12,149
each of those that's kind of consistent

00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:16,980
and that is something they've been able

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:21,809
to do well now we have the geek oh we

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:25,230
have the chameleon changing the colors

00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:28,960
of the chameleon could be feasible that

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:32,890
could be an option but

00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:34,840
I don't think we've gotten there yet we

00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,450
don't know exactly how to do that and

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,100
and that's not that's not a big thing

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:45,300
but it's something that we should think

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,300
about okay so

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:59,160
now brand control it should have some it

00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,380
should give people some feeling it

00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:06,300
should give them a sense that they know

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:08,010
what they're looking at all right and it

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,370
doesn't have to be a parent that doesn't

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:14,100
have to be in your face but it should

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:20,550
you know brands should kind of give you

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:23,760
a feeling that that you trust in

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:26,130
something that you're looking at and you

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,250
associate that you know when you

00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:31,950
associate something with opensuse you

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:36,020
want them to feel like this is a trusted

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:40,290
brand you know even though it might be

00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:42,690
like will give open QA as an example we

00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:46,080
could we can look at that and we go well

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,830
it's it's a opensuse it's not in your

00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:52,730
face branding but you can trust that it

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:57,450
is something that you would like to use

00:16:52,730 --> 00:17:02,790
and you can trust that it's a very

00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:12,320
technical type of type of service or

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:12,320
tool that that can be put this

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,990
it's a service or tool that you can

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:27,050
associate is with opensuse and opens is

00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:30,290
a very expert technical project so we

00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:34,610
appeal to developers we appeal to sis

00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:36,110
admins so you can trust in that that

00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:38,720
this is something that you would want to

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:43,520
use because you know that the brand are

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,800
that the that the project is filled with

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,730
tons of talented and technical technical

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,730
people okay

00:17:54,340 --> 00:18:01,450
familiarity that's that's that's a key

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:03,730
point that kind of goes back to you know

00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:05,590
trying to have something that people

00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:08,950
associate with but visually they can

00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:14,549
capture they can feel it so I'm going to

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:14,549
give play this the next video I have

00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,119
ah

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:32,679
are you finished well thank you how

00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:41,539
thoughtful would you like a chocolate oh

00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:44,899
yeah sure thanks oh sorry Sheldon I

00:18:41,539 --> 00:18:51,760
almost sat in your spot did you I didn't

too much I'm sorry sit thank you

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:20,240
chocolate yes please oh hey Kim yeah you

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,570
know what hold on let me take this in

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,570
the hall

00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:39,690
guess they got to the place okay I know

00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:41,190
what you're doing really yes you're

00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,570
using chocolates as positive

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:45,799
reinforcement for what you consider

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,799
correct behavior

00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:52,919
very good shop down

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:03,090
Sheldon you can't train my girlfriend

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:08,340
like a lab rat actually it turns out I

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:10,170
can well are you shouldn't there's just

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,790
no pleasing you is there Leonard you

00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,470
weren't happy with my previous approach

00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,300
to dealing with her so I decided to

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:17,160
employ operant conditioning techniques

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,440
building on the words of Thorndike and

00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,210
BF Skinner yet by this time next week I

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,650
believe I can have her jumping out of a

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:28,410
pool balancing a beach ball on her nose

00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:30,570
no this has to stop now I'm not

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,570
suggesting we really make her jump out

00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:36,450
of a pool I thought the bazinga was

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,520
implied I'm just tweaking her

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,040
personality if sanding off the rough

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:44,700
edges if you will no you're not sanding

00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,640
penny are you saying that I am forbidden

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,230
from applying a harmless scientifically

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:59,120
valid protocol that will make our lives

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:59,120
better yes you're forbidden bad Leonard

00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,870
you know using positive reinforcement

00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,320
techniques I could train that behavior

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,550
out of her in a week no if you let me

00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,250
use negative reinforcement I can get

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,740
done before we go to bed you're not

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,530
squirting her in the face with water no

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,290
of course not we're talking very mild

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:26,420
electric shocks no tissue damage

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:28,460
whatsoever forget it come on you can't

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,990
tell me that you're not intrigued about

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,130
the possibility of building a better

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:36,110
girlfriend but Penny's qualities both

00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:41,870
good and bad are what make her who she

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:46,250
is you mean like that high-pitched

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:49,280
irritating laughs yes you wouldn't

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:52,370
prefer a throaty chuckle you're not

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,740
changing how penny laughs no that would

00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:56,270
be incongruous I was going to lower the

00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:03,440
whole boy still more pleasing register

00:21:56,270 --> 00:22:09,910
oh sorry guys that girl is Frankie come

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,910
again freaky freaky yeah freaky

00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:25,490
have a chocolate

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:28,760
thank you oh I'm going to make some more

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,769
milk and then turn in I've just if you

00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,899
two are planning on engaging in amorous

00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:38,049
activities you'll keep the decibel level

00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:38,049
to a minimum of course thank you

00:22:42,969 --> 00:23:09,049
unbelievable all right so I wanted to

00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:12,409
play that too I wanted to play that is

00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:22,099
perhaps not the best example but it is

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:24,789
something that it it brings up my next

00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:28,460
point and that is that's conditioning so

00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:34,129
conditioning is something that takes

00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:39,200
time but you want to you want to when

00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:48,729
you build Association you want to create

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:48,729
some familiarity yeah so you want to

00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:52,940
this kind of goes back to the web's

00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,099
they're kind of goes to the website but

00:23:52,940 --> 00:24:00,080
i guess i'll leave that as a pause

00:23:55,099 --> 00:24:05,080
really quick but so conditioning you go

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:08,299
to our website and you look at it and

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:12,289
we're here you think you can associate

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:18,950
too opensuse as the project from an

00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:21,469
image standpoint you know we have we

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,909
have the Gecko up on the very top and is

00:24:21,469 --> 00:24:28,700
very small but this is our main page and

00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:31,519
what's interesting about this is it's

00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:37,549
not much different from from

00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:40,820
when the project came online yeah so

00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:44,649
if someone's coming to our website can

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:49,239
they identify as that they're looking at

00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:54,169
opensuse other than obviously the URL

00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:59,809
alright so now we work to the open build

00:24:54,169 --> 00:25:06,379
service how do we know it's a opensuse

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:10,580
project it open build services kind of

00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:15,739
has its own own brand but there's ways

00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:22,059
to get people to subtly identify that

00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:28,070
this project is part of opensuse so

00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:31,249
we'll look at the next one open QA is it

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:36,409
a souza project isn't an opensuse

00:25:31,249 --> 00:25:40,129
project the top line can give you some

00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:43,340
sense that it is an opensuse project but

00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:46,700
you can see the sponsorship here is

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:54,190
souza so it sends a little bit of mixed

00:25:46,700 --> 00:26:00,559
messages machinery this is fairly new

00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:02,259
and it's it's falls in that same

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,559
category I said the open build services

00:26:02,259 --> 00:26:08,600
it's a project that we want multiple

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,940
people to use multiple organizations to

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:16,279
use but we want so we so we don't

00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,470
exactly want to be a strong brand on

00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:20,690
this but we want to have some some brand

00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:22,249
Association how do we get there well

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,409
that's going to take some progress and

00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:30,139
that's going to take some work all right

00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:36,289
go to our social media all right they're

00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:39,379
all kind of the same but granted and and

00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:43,129
I do I have changed these and granted

00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:45,259
this does fall on me but we have at

00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:48,529
least to some point taking over some

00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:50,610
control to where it does show that it's

00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:54,420
an official brand it

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:55,890
show that this is opensuse and when

00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:58,440
you're looking at it and they all look

00:26:55,890 --> 00:27:00,270
the same you can get a sense that this

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,710
is where I'm supposed to be there's tons

00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:08,280
of Facebook pages for opensuse and

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,850
google+ pages and so you kind of sit

00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,890
there you go which ones which ones right

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:16,890
but if you can make them all look

00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:19,799
similar to an extent then people will

00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:21,630
realize that they are on the official

00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:25,590
one and those are where they should look

00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:28,770
for their messages or developments about

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:33,710
the product or have conversations or

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:42,210
voice their opinion all right and our

00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:44,309
YouTube page okay so this is my

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,410
recommendation to you and those that are

00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:52,100
involved in the project if you if you

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:56,480
are creating something new give brand

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:59,340
identity some thought in your process

00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,690
when you're coming to when you're

00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,090
developing the website when you're

00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:10,740
developing any sort of imagery give some

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:13,950
thought to it and we are looking at

00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,660
levels of brand identity and we're still

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,520
looking at I don't have an answer for

00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:26,240
you right now but we are looking at ways

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:32,120
of doing it and and so when you look at

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:35,210
what you want to do to have a different

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:38,130
levels of branding is you want to have

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:41,090
it will take for example strong level

00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:45,840
branding so you know we should have our

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,980
our logo in the same place yeah and it

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,140
should be an apparent that it's an open

00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:54,330
souza project and a medium brand it

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,100
doesn't necessarily need to be the

00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,900
dominant colors that are in the brand

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,809
guidelines that we would come out with

00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:03,690
but it should have some sort of

00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:07,080
familiarity and that could be it could

00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:10,140
be the hexagons it could be the logo not

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,390
really sure right now but we're still

00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:16,550
working on that all right minimal

00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:19,110
powered by opensuse something small it

00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:21,780
again going back to my my thoughts

00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:26,419
earlier when I got here I was thinking

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:29,370
that this actually falls in well with

00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:31,620
what people have been saying about about

00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:35,669
the brand of opensuse and that is

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,500
machinery or open build service they can

00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:39,120
grow legs and they can kind of become

00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,480
their own project do we want to do that

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,850
or do we not want to do that that that's

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:51,660
I think that's really up to you as the

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:53,880
community to decide but but we should

00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:55,350
again go back to at least minimal

00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,700
branding on some of those projects so

00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,700
they do realize where it's coming from

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:09,990
okay so this this is the the website

00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:12,330
that Cynthia and says Lana did and so

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:17,429
we're hoping to get that rolling

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:19,290
sometime soon and they did a great job I

00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:21,840
think and this is this is a start the

00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:24,990
shows that we're moving going back to

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,750
those earlier slides I had where where

00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:31,050
you looked at coke and shell and Apple

00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:34,950
and Microsoft you know they need a

00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:39,030
change and I think us as a community we

00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:41,190
have some momentum here we've we've you

00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:43,140
know are our last three releases have

00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,120
have been lower but now all of a sudden

00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:46,830
we're picking up we're picking up

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,260
momentum we want to drive that momentum

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,860
we want to continue to move forward and

00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,950
that's why we should do something well

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,480
it's not radical but you could you could

00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,220
call it kind of radical we want to

00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:04,309
change we want to we want to show that

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,309
we're actually moving forward yeah

00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,870
this is true this is true it doesn't but

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:20,220
you do see the you do see it up up there

00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:25,280
on the top left if you go to the if you

00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:28,650
go to the website that's on github

00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:31,410
you'll see that that when you scroll

00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:35,160
down it'll continue to stay that way the

00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:36,720
our logo over there yeah and it is it's

00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,780
a lot better than where we're at

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,100
currently right because currently you

00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:42,870
know you're looking at something that's

00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,690
really really small in the search engine

00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:49,500
so this is a start it's a start it

00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:52,200
doesn't have to be perfect it really

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,210
doesn't but it does show men momentum

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,090
you know Apple wasn't perfect when they

00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:00,090
when they changed yeah I mean they've

00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:03,200
changed their logo what four times in

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:06,630
the past half a decade and a half um

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,350
same with same with coke you know they

00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:12,090
did kind of revert back but but they you

00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,790
have to progress and then eventually

00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:16,770
you're going to find what you know what

00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:19,500
is what's right for you what's right for

00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:25,230
your project or what's right for for

00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:30,570
your brand okay and this is kind of the

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:35,610
last point I want to make is I I saw

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:39,299
this and it really resonates well and

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:41,910
that is if you don't take control of the

00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:45,270
brand or at least give people some

00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:49,380
parameters to work within their going to

00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:53,130
brand it for you and it's not going to

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,710
be consistent and we should at least to

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:59,130
some extent have a level of consistency

00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm not saying that we're driving this

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:06,270
I'm saying that it is you know when we

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,640
get the guidelines in and we're starting

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,600
to move forward with these with these

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,659
projects people will come on board and

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,790
they can freely develop and be a part of

00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,549
the conversation we want that you know

00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:20,820
we we realize that we don't we didn't we

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:24,990
don't

00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:26,669
perfect you know by no means but we're

00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,669
making progress and we're moving in a

00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:32,009
direction we do need voices to tell us

00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:33,720
what could be different than when when

00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:36,090
the board stood up yesterday and they

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,190
and they talked about they talked about

00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:41,549
the website and and the gentleman that

00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:43,409
was over here had expressed that maybe

00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:45,960
perhaps we're missing out on something

00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:48,149
that's good that's a good feedback you

00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,570
know because we need to know that and we

00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:55,889
need to we need to take that feedback

00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:58,500
and and approach it down the line now

00:33:55,889 --> 00:34:00,470
and it's not it's on and everything

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,299
everything takes work and it takes

00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:09,980
patience and it'll all come it'll all

00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:09,980
come over time so questions

00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:33,010
distribute do you think they think the

00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:35,110
cook do you think it's a that needs to

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,450
be some kind of committee a couple of

00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:39,580
people that monitor what is happening

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:42,130
with the Browning because if you look at

00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:46,240
it now you find Facebook sites that use

00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:48,250
the branding that was there in 2011 it's

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,620
all over the place it's I'm not saying

00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,679
it's a mess because it it's a thing that

00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:55,630
happens over the years mmm wouldn't it

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,790
be good to have some people watching

00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:01,570
this monitoring this to keep the

00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:03,690
branding uniform yeah it does make sense

00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,970
and we have the design theme that has

00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:09,580
you know they've established an email i

00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:13,270
should post that somewhere but they've

00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:16,150
established an email to where we want

00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:18,370
that you if you have like a design that

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,380
you want to work on they'll be able to

00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:23,170
give you feedback and they're the ones

00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:25,570
that design the brand Brandon gut you do

00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,780
we make a committee out of that we could

00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:32,560
I could see that as a possibility but we

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:35,200
really want to we do want to bring

00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,530
things together and we do want to have a

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:45,280
consistent look and feel of our project

00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:47,170
and if the marketing team wants to do

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,970
that that would be great if people want

00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,550
to come on board and participate that

00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:53,310
and that would be great but we also need

00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:56,440
the people who are running those

00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:59,260
websites whether it be you know Facebook

00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:05,530
opensuse Spain or you know Facebook

00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:09,340
opensuse China or Taiwan we want those

00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:10,840
people to kind of look at this look at

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,410
the guidelines and kind of come together

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:18,400
and does that come to us simply

00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:20,140
force-feeding no it doesn't but but we

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,660
do want to have some some level of

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:26,890
consistency with our colors with our

00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:30,270
logo that that's definitely important so

00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:35,800
does that answer your question

00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:38,710
about you have any thoughts about how

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:41,230
you would do that because let's say this

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,750
is all done the way with what the record

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:45,250
is seeing now yeah are you going to

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:47,530
spread that to all these people who are

00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:50,230
not looking at it at the guidelines I

00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:52,540
mean I moderate the G+ page I can't

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:56,020
spend every day looking at the

00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:58,660
guidelines did I change anything have

00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:02,050
you only thoughts about how you are you

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:04,570
pushing the things that are done in two

00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,880
hey I guess we could use the wiki we

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,650
could use the wiki and have and put some

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:14,440
of these out there you know because

00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:17,410
granted were we're not it does come back

00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,950
to that that official page thing you

00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:24,160
know because because we're a project of

00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:26,770
many languages and people and so maybe

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,570
it maybe it does make more sense to put

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,570
something on the wiki and then people

00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:35,020
that want to add something would work

00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:37,330
with the design team and developing it

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,830
and then put it on the wiki as well but

00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:40,960
I either way I think we should all

00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:46,000
somewhat be consistent with what we're

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:50,620
doing restoring the basic images basic

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,360
colors in some website there's not an

00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:54,670
idea but because now if I want to know

00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:56,760
but Susan logo on my website I will

00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:59,050
download it get some from somewhere and

00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:02,380
incorporated in my website because there

00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:03,840
is no stable place to retrieve it from

00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,840
so that it will automatically change

00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,840
yeah

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,420
yeah I I don't I mean if there's a way

00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:17,359
of doing that that might be good if we

00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,859
could code something that can be

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,049
consistent throughout that would could

00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:23,660
be pretty cool and an interesting idea

00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:28,210
not necessarily sure how that would work

00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:31,599
but where it actually pushes pushes from

00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:35,809
one repository to the various other

00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:42,730
other people that are running these

00:38:35,809 --> 00:38:42,730
running these sites I'd be helpful yeah

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,069
yeah well I don't have a question more

00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,640
of our comments to your question

00:38:54,069 --> 00:39:01,390
actually with been to team that we

00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,519
started some time ago you can find it if

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,880
you take a look at one of the web pages

00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:09,880
that are using it there is a URL that is

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,009
static and that reference is been to

00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,849
team and whenever something changes

00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:17,980
invented team it gets loaded on all the

00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:20,940
websites but I don't think that we ever

00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:24,480
changed it but I know that I did

00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:29,079
branding on one of the services that I

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:32,980
create it and I basically use this URL

00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:37,359
so I'm sure that all these menus

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:41,259
whenever they are updated its get pulled

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:44,140
in from open to society so we've got

00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:46,539
this point kinda for at least meant to

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:53,279
team and I guess we can do the same for

00:39:46,539 --> 00:39:53,279
the new crazy team or whatever form an

00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:59,190
appoint any questions any other

00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:59,190
questions

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:08,690
okay all right thank you very much try

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,690
