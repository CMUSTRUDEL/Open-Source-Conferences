Title: Replacing Xorg input-drivers with libinput
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	This presentation will discuss the plans to move Xorg to use libinput too through an input driver called xf86-input-libinput, as well as the status of this move. xf86-input-libinput is scheduled to be the default Xorg input driver for Fedora 22.
Currently xorg uses a 1 driver per input device model, this makes it impossible to do things like middle button scrolling on the trackpoint on laptops where the trackpoint buttons are softbuttons on the touchpad. Besides this the xf86-input-synaptics driver was never really designed for multi-touch touchpads and this causes various issues.
For Wayland we've been working on a new improved input stack, which is to be shared by all compositors and lives inside libinput. This talk is about switching the xf86-input-* part of the Xorg input stack over to libinput by using a wrapper called xf86-input-libinput.
This talk will focus on the process and status of making this switch, can we make the switch without loosing any features, what updates are needed to the control-panel-applets of various desktop-environments to work with this new stack ?
