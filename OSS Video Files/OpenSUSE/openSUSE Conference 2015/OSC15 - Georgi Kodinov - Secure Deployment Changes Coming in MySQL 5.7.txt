Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	In this talk will go through an overview of the recent trends in securely deploying a MySQL server.
Then we will examine the new 5.7 developments that facilitate more secure MySQL installations by default.
For each new development we will outline the problem being solved, the solution proposed and how does it fit into the general vision of MySQL server security.
We will also examine the changes done to the RPM packages, the directory layout and the permissions of the files installed.
We will compare this with the 5.6 installation and examine how it can be fixed in it too.
