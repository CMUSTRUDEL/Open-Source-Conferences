versatile for humans to test even the most common configurations. Therefore
openQA was introduced and became an indispensable part of the openSUSE
development and release processes. openQA is an automated test tool for
operating systems. It allows to test the whole installation process of an
operating system in a wide range of software and hardware configurations
by leveraging qemu. This talk gives an introduction to openQA and explains how
