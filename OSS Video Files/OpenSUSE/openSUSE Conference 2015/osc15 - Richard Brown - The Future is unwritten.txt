Publication date: 2015-05-01
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	This session will discuss in detail a new SUSE project and start the discussion on its potential benefits for openSUSE
It'll explain some of the concepts, the thoughts behind this new approach and provide some ideas about future processes, especially those which relate to openSUSE and the adoption, support, and maintenance of code between SUSE and openSUSE

hey look this time wonderful hello yes

00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:13,500
so I'm here to talk to you about the

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,330
project that doesn't have a name it

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,310
start inside suzy we've been working on

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:21,119
this for about a year we first called it

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,730
core then we call it cornerstone then

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,160
record it elements and Voldemort and

00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,170
whatever it doesn't have a name the

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,009
future is unwritten and so is the title

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,200
of this slide deck and while the name

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,940
isn't there the concept is and that's

00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,530
what I've had to talk to you about so to

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,469
talk about that really I need to start

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,559
by talking about where we are as a

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,730
project in opensuse that means I've got

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,940
to talk about tumbleweed for a little

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,780
bit and then I want to talk about what

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,020
makes a perfect regular release what do

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,610
we do now for that I'll give a bit of a

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,090
difference is perspective on Susie's

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,699
take on the topic I'll talk about the

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,860
big announcement and then i'll give you

00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,930
the one a proposal for the future of the

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,890
regular beliefs and then it's time for

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,640
questions at the end so opensuse when

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:16,439
nine years old nearly 10 this is the one

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,619
cat picture I have to have one in one

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,189
slide next somewhere and we're always

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:26,640
changing we've been doing this now for

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,890
nine years and every year there's always

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,270
something new coming on we're always

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,180
doing our new releases who are always

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,280
trying new things it's why we're here

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,890
it's why it's interesting and it's also

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,150
why we've other successful I won't go

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,220
into great detail of these but these are

00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,520
the download statistics for our recent

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,619
releases and as you can see 13 tube is

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,820
doing an awful lot better than one of

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,860
our previous elitism but it's not just

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,979
about the releases a big part of the

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:59,189
project is the tools that we use we're

00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,409
project that has a very good linux

00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:05,430
distribution or several very good linux

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:07,020
distributions but really if you if we

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,970
sort of talked about what is the secret

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,410
source of the opensuse project a big

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,650
part of it is the tools that we've made

00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,079
the tools we've used to build what we

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:19,010
we work on and all the other things that

00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:20,750
kind of come off that so in the gotta

00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,459
start was talking about OBS I mean OBS

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:24,650
is also nine years old it basically

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:26,959
started at the same time as the rest of

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,739
the project we use it for building

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,730
everything opensuse everything souza as

00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:34,700
you know it supports all these different

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:38,180
distributions red hat fedora ubuntu

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,739
debian arch and it's used by a lot of

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,209
other people too I'm cloud use it for

00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,829
building their packages for the next

00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,299
foundation plc etc and as marcus already

00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:49,549
talked about we have open QA which

00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:53,209
interestingly started three years later

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,920
and we use it for testing all the

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,690
distributions we use we're also now

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,930
starting to use it for testing

00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:01,489
applications much much more it's a key

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:04,150
part of the Valen release process for

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:06,290
tumbleweed souza have now adopted it for

00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:09,889
testing the suse linux enterprise

00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:12,139
releases and also right have adopted it

00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:15,250
for testing fedora they're now using it

00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:18,230
for testing Fedora rawhide for door 22

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:20,780
and hopefully they'll carry on using it

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:24,500
carry on sending patches ideas all that

00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:27,109
other fun stuff so putting it all

00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:32,959
together we have tumbleweed are rolling

00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:34,579
release and this started in 2011 but you

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,870
know I'm kind of going to say 2012

00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:40,099
because it makes it nice three years

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:42,650
after we started with open QA and the

00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,579
voting the rolling release now has

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,650
really become the driving force of the

00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,299
earth enthusiasts r abuse imeem we

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,810
originally had it a sort of an add-on on

00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:56,569
top of the regular distribution we then

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:58,760
took factory started open queuing it's

00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:01,159
an awful lot more it's now become a

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,650
standalone rolling release in its own

00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:08,540
right and we have approximately eleven

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,180
thousand five hundred users using it

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,019
every day and grow it hopefully growing

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,639
more because we're going to actually

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,010
start marketing it now rather than just

00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,760
leaving it as a hidden repository

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:22,120
somewhere that nobody knows about and

00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:24,610
the pace of change of tumbleweed is

00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,949
phenomenal the amount of work that we do

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,010
every week on tumbleweed and don't

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:33,500
really talk about it is really really

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,850
quite impressive so last week one of our

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,919
maintainer said you know as he does

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,260
every week this regular report to the

00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,850
mailing list said you know I was a quiet

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,880
week we didn't really do much in tumble

00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,979
with this week we did three distribution

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,440
releases that's three new versions of

00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:51,470
the ISO the renew sets of packages

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,479
interest in the repositories a hundred

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,300
and forty six packages in total got

00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,010
changed that's not including libraries

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,470
and shared packages that's actual

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:03,169
bonafide code changes in the

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:06,560
distribution with changeable change log

00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:08,360
entries 15 new packages on the DVD we

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,620
took away 38 so we're not just adding

00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,300
stuff without tidying up after ourselves

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,820
and one new kernel is that really quiet

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,970
it's not quite at all that's one are

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,669
quiet weeks we're doing what most other

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:26,090
distributions would you know do in a

00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:29,660
month and on a busy week we're doing

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:33,200
crazy amounts of work so this was the

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:36,550
beginning of April where we had two new

00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,440
color versions the new version of 93 16

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,860
which we managed to have published

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,740
shipped released in are tested stable

00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,590
tumbleweed distribution before anybody

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,080
else at all even arch the distribution

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:59,380
that kind of likes to think they

00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:59,380
invented voting distributions thank you

00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,630
so when it comes to getting your

00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:09,470
opensuse on a platform in a stable way

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,419
that works tumbleweed really is the best

00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,000
choice for it and that's not just the

00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,229
best for opensuse users i'm standing up

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,190
on stage and saying it's the best for

00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:20,389
anyone using linux if you want a stable

00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:23,389
linux distribution with the latest

00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:25,710
packages download tumbleweed install it

00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:28,600
use it

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:30,400
but that's falling releases a regular

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:34,810
release is a very different kettle of

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:37,480
fish and when we're talking about the

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,900
opensuse regular release over after nine

00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:42,490
years now I've always felt that the

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,860
regular released opensuse kind of had

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,290
itself stuck in the middle being pulled

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:48,880
in two directions on one side we've

00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:51,220
always had this pull from the community

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,600
from a good chunk of our users for more

00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:56,080
new stuff the latest of everything

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,660
always knew nearest of that everything

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,300
in the opensuse stack and on the other

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,670
side we have a equally sizable chunk of

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,610
users who want everything to be more

00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:08,470
stable more reliable not breaking all

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,330
the time and in some cases not updating

00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,840
all the time they just want a platform

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,720
to actually run their stuff on and this

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,550
has been a really really big part of the

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,020
the opensuse story for the last nine

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,240
years I mean I'm thinking back to sort

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,040
of the the worst moments of mailing

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,300
lists flame wars where we spent six

00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,480
months talking about when the release

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,770
schedule should be because it's kind of

00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,180
the key topic now you know do we do

00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,370
eight months do we do 12 months do we do

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,060
something longer it all boils down to

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:39,640
these two dynamics of do we go faster or

00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,120
do we go slower but now we have

00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:45,130
tumbleweed so really the kind of faster

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,560
side of things is taken care of if you

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,690
want the latest of everything you

00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,880
stumble with and so this gets me

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,990
thinking of well what would the perfect

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:58,150
opensuse regular release looks like we

00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,040
have the opportunity here to probably

00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:04,260
define something that's going to be more

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:07,120
stable may be moving slower but more

00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:09,400
suited for that other side who were

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,330
always calling for that in the open city

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,740
regular release since we've started so

00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,480
obviously we're talking about a very

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,710
very stable distribution well maintained

00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,970
no point having a stable distribution

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,370
that you know isn't getting patches

00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:26,830
isn't getting security updates you still

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:31,030
need it to work and you needed to work

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,440
in production for about three years so

00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,200
the life's like that about three years

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,820
where there's no major changes there's

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,060
no

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:41,070
huge changes to the distribution but

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,210
we're still a community distribution we

00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:45,000
still want this to be a community

00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,860
distribution so you still would want a

00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,690
very wide selection of packages there's

00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:51,030
no point having a really really nice

00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,380
stable platform that you can't install

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:57,540
anything on because nothing is compiled

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,310
for it so in my mind this these are kind

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,620
of the things that we've heard on the

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,900
mailing list and we've heard in

00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:06,000
conferences like this for years and

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,400
we've always said we're impossible but

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,050
now I think it's time to think about

00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,120
whether we can actually do it and from a

00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,650
different perspective I'm now going to

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,290
talk from sort of Suzie side of things

00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,690
you've been looking at this as well from

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,180
their business side for well also the

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,910
last three years if anybody's been an

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,790
osc for the last two years you've seen

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,420
this slide which is talking about the

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:35,010
famous gap where you know souza have

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,840
their enterprise products which of

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:39,540
course targets enterprise users and big

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,250
developers we of course have our

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,110
community distribution which does a very

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,420
good job for being for developers in

00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,570
enthusiasts but there's a gap in between

00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:52,140
the two where you something in between

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:55,290
not quite as stable as slee not quite as

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:57,800
fast as opensuse where we could really

00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,800
do some very interesting things both

00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,390
technically as developers but also for

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,890
our users so they can actually find

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:09,120
something that fits exactly what they

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:11,520
want in between the two so it's actually

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,990
improving the gap from Susie's

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,250
perspective would really help their

00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:19,380
their desire to collaborate more on

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,960
opensuse at the moment with this with

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,460
this gap in between the two sleeve Ella

00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:27,690
purrs don't get much of an opportunity

00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:30,570
to really work on opensuse because our

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:33,090
code base is moving too fast and they

00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:34,830
need a lot more time to do their work on

00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:36,180
our platform to backport stuff forward

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:38,910
port stuff whatever they want to do

00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:41,160
between the two that takes an awful lot

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,030
of work and the bigger that gap is the

00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,030
more work that requires

00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:50,229
and also that means we don't get their

00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:51,819
patches as easily into open season and

00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:53,079
also in the other way it's also a lot

00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:54,549
harder for them to take the really cool

00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:58,449
stuff that we've done an opensuse and

00:10:54,549 --> 00:11:00,669
then put that into sleep so that ends up

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,619
being like Willie 12 a huge amount of

00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:09,369
work to get to the same point where we

00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:12,160
were already act with 31 and 32 so this

00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:15,220
is where this is sort of the

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,899
long-standing story of yeah sousa

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:22,689
wanting to work with opensuse

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,399
collaborate on opensuse do all the

00:11:22,689 --> 00:11:25,779
innovation in the open city project and

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,139
then be able to use it as part of the

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:30,249
main see distribution so as we've heard

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:33,429
now on the mailing list and with

00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:35,410
Marcus's its presentation the big

00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:38,949
announcement that sort of Sousa wanted

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,979
say to here is all of the latest slee

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:46,359
sources for Susan over them Enterprise

00:11:41,979 --> 00:11:50,319
12 are now in the OBS available for

00:11:46,359 --> 00:11:52,329
opensuse to build with their there and

00:11:50,319 --> 00:11:56,049
that also includes the maintenance

00:11:52,329 --> 00:12:00,449
updates so as Slee 12 gets maintenance

00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:03,009
updates they will also appear in OBS and

00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:06,459
opensuse can now actually build a

00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:10,470
community distribution with enterprise

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,470
sources as part of it

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,510
so not only are we getting collaboration

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:26,130
we're actually getting code now which is

00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:28,500
awesome so when we're talking about sort

00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,210
of closing the gap the the benefits

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,110
really work in both ways opensuse now

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:38,400
have a chance to take this regular this

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:41,070
stable base and build possibly a very

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:45,720
very interesting regular release on top

00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:47,970
of it and if we do that then we end up

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,590
with a situation where it'll be an awful

00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,690
lot easier in both directions for

00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:52,980
collaboration but it's from Susie

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,020
engineers who were working mainly

00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,720
honestly to actually contribute a stuff

00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,300
back upstream to opensuse and for open

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,700
Caesar stuff to get into this stable

00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:05,090
code base and actually dramatically

00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,270
improve the pace at which you can change

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:11,910
so what am I really proposal come back

00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:15,090
to here again we've got tumbleweed we've

00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:19,700
got the stable regular release let's

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:22,650
make it more stable with opensuse and

00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:26,160
the shared resources and suse linux

00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:28,260
enterprise the way we're currently

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,140
thinking about it and these are just

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,060
proposals nothing set in stone it we

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,360
would end up with a situation where

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,610
you'd have tumbleweed as it is right now

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,310
untouched moving as fast as it always

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,520
does moving as fast as it always will or

00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:48,960
faster if we can manage it and the

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:53,670
opensuse release will have a shared core

00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,680
between slee and opensuse so you there

00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,540
about a thousand packages probably the

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:03,590
base system kernel all of the core or if

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,690
we wanted the entire sort of silly base

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:09,960
and on top of that opensuse could then

00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,430
build each distribution of basically all

00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,560
the community packages that you don't

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:18,360
get in sleep which at the moment is

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:22,820
about 6,000 the interesting idea with

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,230
this proposal is for us with 13 to

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,660
whatever comes next whatever we call it

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,730
if we call it 13 3 or whatever

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:32,680
this would possibly be a bit of a back

00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:35,850
step in some sense and you know the

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:39,520
colonel would would go back a little bit

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,010
no one would go back a little bit but

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:44,110
you'll end up with a really stable

00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:50,339
rookie the release as an approach what

00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:50,339
are you giggling about no possibly okay

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,850
or alternatively we are also thinking of

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,529
the things like this where the opensuse

00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:05,740
regular release could very easily

00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:07,870
overlay replace adapt its own packages

00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,700
to basically overwrite the ones provided

00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:14,680
by Slee therefore we could have a newer

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:17,170
version of loan the the downside of this

00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,810
approach or the thing to take into

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:22,570
account with this approach is of course

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,980
if the community does that we don't get

00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,520
the free maintenance of the core

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,709
packages for the bits we replace so you

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,570
know if we're putting a new version of

00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:33,850
Nome on top of this base then we're

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:36,700
maintaining this version of Nome just

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,839
like we do now but we have to realize

00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:41,230
that that's going to be something on our

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,720
backs to actually build but I think if

00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:46,480
if we go this route we end up with a

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,720
chance to build our perfect stable

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,089
regular place it would be stable it

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,209
would be maintained the plan from souza

00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:58,180
is to have these core packages updated

00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:00,550
for at least three years basically keep

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,070
them updated and available in OBS until

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,440
the next big version of sleek comes

00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:08,770
around which will be rate based on

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:11,560
tumbleweed so yeah three four maybe five

00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:15,130
years and we'd have our wide selection

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:17,350
of packages so the question for the

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,829
audience here and anybody at home who's

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:23,560
can comment on this on the mailing list

00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:25,899
do we like the idea if we do like the

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,800
idea then how the heck are we actually

00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:32,230
going to build it because none of this

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,209
is arranged in OBS right now the

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:36,910
packages are there the point the sources

00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:38,470
are there but how we structure the

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,350
project is how we handle things like

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,890
processes submissions

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:47,760
putting the thing together this is or to

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:50,520
be discussed or to be decided when do we

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,890
do the first release the current plan

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:56,630
from Souza is to have Slee 12 released

00:16:52,890 --> 00:17:00,930
by the end of the year so C 12 sp1 sorry

00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:04,100
so in theory we could have opensuse next

00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:07,920
whatever we call it about the same time

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:10,260
when do we do other releases do we tie

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,330
the opensuse regular release to the same

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,820
schedule as sleee in which case we'd be

00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:17,850
talking about about annual about a void

00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:18,900
between 12 and 18 months what do we do

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,150
something different the code will be

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,580
there we can choose how we use it how we

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:25,650
want to consume it how we build our

00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,030
regular release but I think we can build

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,610
something really really exciting about

00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:31,890
this so and of course who's going to

00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:33,420
help build it it's a community project

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:37,470
this will always be a community project

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,810
so we need volunteers to work on this to

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,640
put it together to figure out these

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,580
processes and then of course help

00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,890
maintain it in the long run and on that

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,890
I have time for questions now

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,000
anyone I can't see anything could this

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,000
low to my eyes

00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:12,700
yeah I can I can see this is fun a lot

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,400
of handset okay of the people who aren't

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,600
interested in using it are you not

00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,150
interested because you're using

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:25,480
tumbleweed or be if you just so quick

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:28,750
hand up okay so who really hates this

00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,810
idea would be the best thing I guess no

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:37,090
no one ok that's pretty exit pretty

00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:38,560
that's a pretty good stuff any other

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:41,280
questions or questions to the audience

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,280
yes Adrian

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,580
there's there's been some talk about

00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,710
that yes so to repeat the question the

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,230
question was have we thought about kind

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:04,950
of any workflow for getting community

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,180
changes you know back into the the core

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,460
for this of the shared core between

00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,310
saline opensuse and there's been some

00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,510
sort about it nothing set in stone like

00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,610
we haven't even got a name so of course

00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,830
nothing set in stone but I do actually

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,940
have a slide the end here which kind of

00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:23,350
perfectly fits this kinda um ignore the

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,050
version numbers because of course

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,480
they're all likely to change but the

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:31,570
rough idea into a min terms of sort of

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,000
flow would be the stuff that opensuse

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:38,020
puts in the opensuse regular release

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,750
would be prime candidates for being sort

00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:44,110
of assumed into the next service pack

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,450
for the stable base so whether it's

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,890
everything or selected stuff but it

00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,650
would be an awful lot easy to

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,690
cherry-pick and move stuff there so

00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,520
that's kind of the concept at this point

00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,530
is sort of community stuff would be the

00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:02,470
prime candidate for stuff in the next

00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:05,380
base version that's a rough idea that's

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,830
what I'm in with this with square error

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,830
in the middle

00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,180
yes

00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:23,860
yes thanks my problem with two married

00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:27,970
is virtual box and video drivers with

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:30,930
these work w is because for now is the

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:34,180
main reason why i use of inches well

00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:35,980
with that so it's a question so if your

00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,910
problem is you've got problems with

00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:42,940
virtualbox and the yes graphic driver

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:45,790
said and we have 12 books and he to rise

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,950
they won't work into bad ways yeah so it

00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:50,620
is the question will they work in as

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:54,490
because the gap is increasing between

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:57,610
timber trees and then yes release all

00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:02,110
the people using virtualization yeah

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:06,820
will be a budget to take open shoes then

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:08,620
to get under stable fashion yeah when

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,360
the kite in the case of both of those I

00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,550
mean you're using the proprietary video

00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,040
drivers I'm assuming and of course

00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:19,300
virtualbox as its proprietary with

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:21,340
add-on modules and those would work fine

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,260
with a regular release following this

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,190
approach and of course it's still

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,280
something we're looking at improving

00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:29,670
inside tumbleweed so yes I guess is the

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,670
easy answer

00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,690
question at the back over there yeah

00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:55,590
no this is the source repeating the

00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,870
question the question was it does OBS

00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:00,660
mean what does this mean that OBS is now

00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,940
building an open sleep and the answer's

00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,980
no these are the sources they're not

00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,740
compiled packages so they're they're

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,970
available for us to use in other

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:14,070
projects but there we're not out of the

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:15,990
gate starting by building and open Slee

00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,220
and to be honest I think at an approach

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,280
like this is actually way more

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,700
interesting you know Slee is a great

00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,630
enterprise product but if we did an open

00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,980
sleigh it would just be the same product

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,720
with this we end up being able to

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:35,610
produce something that actually has more

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,140
packages built on there with of course

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:39,990
the tweaks that we the community think

00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,880
might be better for it so I think we

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:43,320
kind of get the best of both worlds and

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,240
we definitely get a chance to build

00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:52,220
something that's got more to it in terms

00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,220
of packages yes right at the back there

00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:04,950
there's there's no pressure in terms of

00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,720
time I think we have a kind of episode

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,450
the question was is there any pressure

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,610
for time for like to do a release with

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,120
this there's no pressure for time

00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,410
besides the pressure we give ourselves

00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,670
obviously there's always going to be

00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:19,920
discussions about a roadmap at the

00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:23,400
moment we haven't got a published plan

00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,260
for 13 3 this of course potentially

00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,000
disrupt SAT and means we get to write a

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,860
completely new plan for the regular

00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,490
release and yeah so nothing set in stone

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:39,750
I would say there's potential for sort

00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:43,890
of a natural end of this year because

00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:45,840
that's when Slee 12 sp1 is intended so

00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:47,910
we'd have a chance to maybe build the

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,740
first release of this kind of regular

00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:54,050
release with that version of the code

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:57,530
base but that's just an idea a concept

00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,530
not a deadline

00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:08,520
anybody else got any hands up I can't

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:08,520
see yes Christopher

00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:17,269
so how in practice will the arrows going

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:20,840
down from tumbleweed into the stable

00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:22,820
core work because you know as tumbleweed

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,559
keeps running off into the few gather

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,639
the distance would get bigger and bigger

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,110
and so yeah so if if we want yeah so the

00:24:28,639 --> 00:24:32,419
question is sort of how how were these

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,009
lines down from tumbleweed work and how

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:38,470
would you know stuff from tumbleweed end

00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:40,940
up in this the opensuse release then

00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:42,049
that's that's going to be work I mean

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,629
it's it's going to be working that I

00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:46,070
think actually we're very capable and

00:24:44,629 --> 00:24:48,470
skilled to do because actually very

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,320
similar work that we already do in many

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:53,240
cases already been a projects like the

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,690
you know an omen KDE team are quite good

00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:58,759
at taking you know their stacks and then

00:24:56,690 --> 00:25:01,129
effectively back porting it in like Lena

00:24:58,759 --> 00:25:03,860
KDE or gnome stable add-on project

00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:05,659
inside obs so these are things we know

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:07,879
very well and it would be kind of that

00:25:05,659 --> 00:25:11,210
same process but then submitting it to

00:25:07,879 --> 00:25:13,549
the stable distribution as that gap gets

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,710
longer and longer and longer that work

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:20,470
will get harder and harder and harder

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:23,090
definitely but then maybe this is a

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,740
conscious decision to minute maybe we

00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:26,539
should make a constitution that every

00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,009
version of opensuse doesn't necessarily

00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:31,399
have to have every new version of

00:25:28,009 --> 00:25:34,159
everything you know with we've got that

00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:37,369
that's tumbleweed so maybe we target the

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,759
stable release for different use case

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:43,129
which doesn't necessarily need that

00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:45,470
newest of everything in every version so

00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:46,789
this yeah this version of this flight

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:49,129
doesn't show this but in the original

00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:51,080
version of this slide those lines coming

00:25:49,129 --> 00:25:52,759
down from tumbleweed kind of got fainter

00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,649
and fainter as time went on because I

00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,340
think over time we'd probably pull a

00:25:54,649 --> 00:26:00,350
little bit less until you kind of get to

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:04,009
talking about okay what about the next

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:05,419
big core version and then we would just

00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:08,210
do like we do now and just take

00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:10,669
everything at a tumbleweed and suck the

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:14,710
whole thing down so that's kind of how

00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:14,710
we see it working right

00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,270
oh yeah question back there

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,169
yeah that's yeah so yeah you should be

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,879
able to use that project as a bill

00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:45,320
target and build your package for that

00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:45,320
and yes that should should be possible

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:56,039
any other questions I can kind of see

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,039
faces sort of there we go

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,600
yes

00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:05,960
yes

00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:19,950
yeah this is this is something we can't

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:23,340
yet so the question is is could we build

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:26,690
an opensuse on the version of the shared

00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,190
code that will become 3 12's be one

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,380
that's an idea we've definitely kicked

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,180
around as a possibility and that's

00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,310
really a case of timings what the

00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,450
community think what we all think then

00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:39,720
we'll figure out with Sue's of what

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,820
works there one of the ideas that would

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,850
we definitely kicked around no one said

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:49,320
wasn't a bad idea when I suggested it

00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:53,100
was having the sort of a decent solid

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,570
beta from silly 12 sp1 and that's when

00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:58,590
open sea to start building on top of

00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:59,850
that so it would be earlier but not way

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,440
too early where everything's moving

00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:03,450
there because you don't really want to

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,880
have a code base that's flying all over

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:08,010
the place but once it's relatively

00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,710
stable during the sort of sleet 12

00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:12,240
service pack development that that might

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:15,800
be the right time for open CZ to start

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,800
building on it yes I quite like the idea

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,370
don't know if cooler does though you're

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:31,730
kind of looking at me funny that's true

00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:34,690
good point yes in the back Greg I'll

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:37,490
wait for the mic this time thank you on

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:39,620
the mailing list the opensuse project

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:43,720
mailing list one of the immediate

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:46,309
reactions to your announcement was

00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,669
regarding how this might resemble CentOS

00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:51,080
and you you guarded against an immediate

00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:53,150
response to that that you might respond

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:55,010
to that more late later perhaps in your

00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:58,400
announcement today there are pros and

00:28:55,010 --> 00:29:01,669
cons to being a centos kind of thing

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,950
could you respond to that yeah I think I

00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:06,230
kind of answer that question earlier but

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,720
i'll try and do it in a different way

00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:12,679
that kind of makes more sense i guess

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,980
the the biggest sort of pro and con of

00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:18,110
ascent OS is it's just going to be

00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:21,669
exactly the same as sleep with no

00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,690
additions no extra packages nothing

00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:27,559
potentially newer and more interesting

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,700
in there it'll just be the same and i

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:30,260
think we have an opportunity here to

00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,330
make something way more interesting than

00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,809
that you know an opensuse community

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:38,450
distribution with community packages and

00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:42,760
community ideas in it but with this nice

00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:45,289
stable shared code in it so I'd say the

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,120
the idea it works best if we build

00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:48,919
something better than center west rather

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,240
than just kind of following that same

00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,940
model doing that same way which we won't

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,289
get either side won't get nearly as much

00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,289
out of it at all

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:23,629
you want to repeat that over the mic cuz

00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:29,080
it sounded good but I don't wanna repeat

00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:29,080
it look like ya Sonny

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,140
is it Mike thanks sunny sorry

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:42,900
I think in response to the question

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:45,740
about sent West's similarities etcetera

00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:49,410
I think the proposal here is more of a

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:52,590
bridge between what since Wes are doing

00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,270
which is effectively taking the

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:57,020
enterprise distribution that they base

00:30:54,270 --> 00:31:00,360
off of and that's all what they get and

00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:03,030
then you've got canonical the bunters

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:07,400
LTS which is their enterprise offering

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:10,500
which has slightly newer versions

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:15,630
software but it still maintained for

00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:19,530
three years we with this would be able

00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:22,560
to offer something that kind of bridges

00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,920
both camps so if you're an LTS user

00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:28,800
because you need the long-term space

00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,050
then you've got that same with center

00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,660
less but you've got the newer releases

00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:37,410
of the software that you need whether it

00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:39,800
be Colonel patches backcourt of the

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:43,340
patches for kernel and other subsystems

00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,340
it's all there

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,930
two

00:31:49,880 --> 00:32:01,060
any other questions feedback ideas

00:31:52,270 --> 00:32:01,060
suggestions flames no

00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:14,739
well then I guess I'm done thank you

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:16,269
very much and please join the

00:32:14,739 --> 00:32:18,850
conversation of the project mailing list

00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:21,190
talk about it while we're here get these

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,929
ideas going and then we can start

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,190
building this if everybody thinks it's a

00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,190
