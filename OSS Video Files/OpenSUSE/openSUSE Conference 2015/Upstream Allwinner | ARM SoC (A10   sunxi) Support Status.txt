Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The linux-sunxi community has been slowly but steadily working on getting Allwinner SoCs like the A10 supported in upstream u-boot and the kernel.
This talk will present the current status of Allwinner support upstream.
Which SoCs are supported and which ones are not (yet) supported? Which blocks of the supported SoCs are supported, and which are not? Why are some SoCs / blocks not supported, and what are the plans to get them supported? This are some of the questions this talk tries to answer.
