Title: osc15 - Jos Weyers - Showing keys in public. What could possibly go wrong?
Publication date: 2015-05-02
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	A password shouldn’t be on a post-it note.
In plain view.
On the console.
The password to a locked door is called a key.
So if a reporter wants to get the point across that certain people shouldn't have access to a particular key, would it be wise for said reporter to show that key to the world?
This talk will show how not to run this story, why we should care and maybe make you rethink your physical security a bit.

good day well like twin sets we're going

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,700
to talk about security and actually

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,639
we're going to talk about security well

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,390
basically in for making information

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:23,070
leakage visual information leakage by

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,900
keys because well because I think Keys

00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,689
is a password and we'll get to that

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,730
later I'm your science i'm a member of

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,489
tool that's the open organization of

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:35,520
lock Pickers that means we pick locks we

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:38,399
open locks for sport and we do that well

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,379
without a key and without force so we

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,020
leave as little trace as possible and we

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:46,020
try to do it as fast as possible and as

00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,390
a sports lock picker you bound to

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:52,289
certain rules because well life is all

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:56,989
about rules at least sometimes one first

00:00:52,289 --> 00:01:00,960
rule is never pick a lock you do not own

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,460
rule number two do not well if there is

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,070
a lucky don't own and you still want to

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,340
pick then you have to get explicit

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:11,040
permission from the actual owner that is

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,830
okay for you to pick it and you should

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,670
also not pick locks that you rely upon

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,320
because at some point you will fail and

00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,659
if you fail on your front door then it

00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,960
either won't close or won't open again

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,180
so that's wrong thing so that's a couple

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,310
of simple rules that will come back to

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,380
later in the in the presentation I'm

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,130
also a member of hack 42 which is an

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,100
awesome haircuts pace in arnhem and

00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:40,500
hackaday had a couple of words on that

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,579
they said wow the three-letter word does

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,350
not even begin to describe the

00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,200
awesomeness that is heck 42 and it can

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,680
only understand that of course I will

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:55,790
start off with a small video to get the

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:55,790
feel of D talk there is all knowledge

00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:18,660
show of hands who thinks this is a good

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:22,530
idea I think it's a neat idea I don't

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,600
think it's a good idea and I don't get

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,310
some parts of this because well I don't

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,080
know what you guys live but in my

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,100
neighborhood is way easier to find the

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,000
locksmith than a 3d printing facility

00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:36,690
unless you're a member of a conspiracy

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,210
of course but but then again I mean if

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,520
your luck fails or whatever get help on

00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,950
that department but what you saw is that

00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:49,170
they basically made a 3d render of your

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:54,510
van actual key by putting it on a

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:56,280
turning surface so all sides of the key

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,520
could actually be scanned and they made

00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,410
a 3d print of it adds normal locks so

00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,960
not the high high security locks but the

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,430
normal stuff that you die or you for

00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,480
that matter might have in your front

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:13,230
door because I'm a lot nerd I different

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:17,489
different bracket and those locks can

00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:20,609
have tolerances those locks can have

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:25,050
tolerances that our way within the scope

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:27,300
of 3d printers so that works and what

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:30,720
you saw here and actually this ad was

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,850
from a Belgian insurance company so if

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,890
your house does get looted afterwards

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:38,010
then at least you know who to pay for so

00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:42,090
that's so that takes care of business so

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:44,700
the 3d turning thing is because it's

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:48,240
Belgium well actually it's Belgium which

00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:50,490
is in Europe which is not America and

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,910
that makes sense because in America as a

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,040
normal consumer you basically have two

00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:01,770
choices if you want to buy a lock that

00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:04,130
is dirt cheap or way too expensive and

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,840
there's almost nothing in between

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,150
actually there's not to my knowledge

00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,850
there's nothing in between because in

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,729
Europe if you go to a a hardware store

00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,470
and you can buy locks right normal locks

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,560
for in your front door you have a choice

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,750
you can have them stupid cheap and very

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,330
expensive and there's a range I mean in

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:27,750
between their stuff and price doesn't

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:31,590
say everything but it's it's a measure I

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,660
mean if a log is stupid cheap you can

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,020
rest assured that it's not that good of

00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:38,310
a lock because a good luck costs money

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:40,919
that doesn't mean if you take a stupid

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,140
lock and just price it high enough that

00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:45,930
automatically gets a good luck but it's

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,530
it's something to look at but in America

00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,570
you have very bad Luck's and very good

00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:52,919
lucks let's not talk about a very good

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,039
luck because they are very expensive

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,570
that's only commercial use so we have

00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:02,030
the cheap option there's actually about

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:06,180
more than ninety five percent of all

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:09,630
american door locks consists of two

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:12,479
brands of luck love lux that's ash lake

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:16,850
and that's a quick set maybe you but but

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:19,320
that's about it so you have very little

00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:23,310
differences in the type of luck sells

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,580
used so if i want to copy a american

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,440
lock American key I don't have to put

00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,380
the key on a pedestal and turn it around

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,350
because by just looking at that key I

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,060
can have a fair guesstimate of what what

00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,220
brand that lock is because i only have

00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:40,950
to choose from three possible breads

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,720
right so i only have to look at the

00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:45,169
bidding curves and actually copy that

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,200
that's way easier that's nothing new

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:51,990
this is a company in America it's called

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:54,690
schlüssel what they do they say just

00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:56,729
take a picture of your p1 picture white

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,130
background which is which were which

00:06:56,729 --> 00:07:01,110
iphone or whatever mail us that picture

00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:03,870
along with all your credit card details

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:08,100
and your home address and we'll ship you

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:10,440
a copy for a fiver five dollars copy at

00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,570
home personally I would use a different

00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,570
address for that

00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:19,630
but so they are able to ship working

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,900
keys to your home from one picture one

00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,400
picture alone they wrote some some quite

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,700
nifty software for it because what it

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,950
does it doesn't just copy the the key

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,560
you send them it actually scans what the

00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:35,140
depth is and looks what the original

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,690
that would be so if you send in a

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,750
picture of a key that's worn down it'll

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,970
look at that depth and say no it's not a

00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,770
valid depth so it has to be higher so

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,830
well higher in the American sense cuz

00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:49,630
they put their locks upside down so you

00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,960
have an above average chance that the

00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:55,750
the key you get in the mill works better

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,930
than the one you step to a picture of

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:01,540
because that new one is cut to code so

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,760
it sits by factory specs you will get a

00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:09,580
new key that's kind of neat right click

00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:12,150
picture if you are the one taking the

00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,150
fiction of course

00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:19,759
this technique got incorporated in other

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:23,960
business model as well this is our box

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,720
out box only works in Manhattan so only

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:31,220
the tiny island and what they do they're

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,400
basically a reverse millman a male as in

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:39,289
physical snail mail so they show up to

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:41,839
your house take away your meal and then

00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,510
they scan it and they mail you distally

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,130
your your physical meal so even if

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:48,680
you're away from home you can read your

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:51,080
spam that's a good idea well probably

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,839
they weed that out but then of course

00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:57,080
they have to have access to your the

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,089
paper stuff they say well just send us a

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,279
picture of your key from your mailbox

00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:02,990
cuz that would probably be out of your

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,570
house right but if it's in the garage we

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,760
need that that keep that picture of that

00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,770
tea as well so they have multiple steps

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,080
but they stopped at your front door

00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:16,310
because they say well we're not going to

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:19,430
go into your house they have shotguns

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,680
they're soo people and so it's it's I

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,570
mean it is America so they just don't

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,339
want to incorporate that in there in the

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:30,830
business day but they could I mean

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:32,839
that's how we do so making working keys

00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:35,029
from a picture there's nothing you this

00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:37,640
has been done before this is picture

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:40,160
from 2008 where the University of

00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,339
California did some research this is a

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,620
well a camera with a serious lens and

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,010
what you can do with the lens like that

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,820
is take pictures like this you see

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:54,740
there's a terrace with a table with the

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:58,700
book on it with keys on it and if you

00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:02,170
zoom in enough you'll see keys and if

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,029
you look at hope is this shiny enough

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,930
almost well let's take a look at this

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:11,390
key see that that's quite straight on

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:15,260
picture so it's it's straight on so

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:17,360
we'll look at these coats but also if

00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,940
you look at the head of the key that's

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,550
quite a peculiar shape right with three

00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,980
holes in there that's all triangles and

00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:25,690
if you know your locks you go like oh

00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,860
yeah

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,540
kwikset lungs that that's the way that

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,510
their their their hats are our shapes so

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:39,649
we know what a original quick shed

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:41,810
quick-set head of a look of a keen looks

00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:45,290
like so if we take the picture we can

00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:47,930
twist it and and crop it and d god knows

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,740
what with it until that head has the

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:55,160
correct shape and size of a normal key

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,950
so if you so in the end so you keep on

00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,190
changing changing changing if this shape

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:03,890
is the correct one then this is also the

00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:05,630
great work and heights and depth of

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:08,180
these cuts I mean they're they're only

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:11,149
go to a certain level so you can decode

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,870
that by picture you make a working key

00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:19,180
and that's from more than 100 meters

00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,180
away one camera one snapshot

00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:27,600
financially so from the site of the key

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,600
you might be able at least sometimes to

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,359
create a key it doesn't always work but

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,600
it doesn't always have to work this is a

00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:41,160
picture that snap at at har at 2093

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,419
routed by ray ray is a member member of

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,169
as his death that's a German

00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:49,739
lock-picking fraternity basically to

00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:51,329
Google Germany and ray laughs his head

00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:53,399
goes he loves his locks but he

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:55,319
definitely have his law forehead cops so

00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,879
when he was walking about at the camping

00:11:55,319 --> 00:12:03,869
ground of V Lowden he saw a cop and he

00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:06,239
saw that sorry he saw a cop and he said

00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:09,569
he had them instantly recognize the

00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:12,839
brand of headlock that's a list but Ray

00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:17,879
is from Germany like I said array head

00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:20,730
cops so in if you look at a country like

00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:23,519
at police handcuffs normally you will

00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:28,829
see that they are keyed alike which

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:32,759
means that every cop can open the locks

00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:35,790
the handcuffs of a other cop so you only

00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:40,829
need one key to open all the handcuffs

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:44,879
of all the cops if you think of it just

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:46,889
a second that might sound stupid only

00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,160
have to league one key to open all the

00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:53,809
cuffs true for a safety perspective

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,579
that's actually a good thing so because

00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:59,129
suppose you get arrested in in in

00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:01,499
Germany my cup number one because you

00:12:59,129 --> 00:13:03,480
put you in his fan god knows what drives

00:13:01,499 --> 00:13:09,179
you off to the station and hands you off

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:11,669
to another cup and then he leaves so

00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:14,129
it's quite nice that that other cup has

00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:15,809
a means to opening your handcuffs how do

00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:17,910
i still turn blue your hands and let's

00:13:15,809 --> 00:13:20,519
that's not a good thing so it's quite a

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,459
normal thing that all handcuffs over all

00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,139
police officers are keyed alike but he's

00:13:23,459 --> 00:13:28,649
from Germany and this is the judge

00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:30,689
police officer so ray was like this is

00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:31,450
the key to Germans mr. police officer

00:13:30,689 --> 00:13:33,520
can

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,950
used my key and your cuffs to figure out

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,750
if that's the same combination please

00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:44,920
officer said off and he turned his

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:48,100
back to him turned his back to him well

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:50,190
this is not a very clear picture right

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,780
so I'm not sure if you can actually

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,000
decode the actual combination of this

00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,550
lock just from this picture but you

00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,250
can't see that's a high low high bit

00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:02,430
less lowish and you definitely if you

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,480
compare it to the are the original one

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:11,170
yeah that's a fair guess that these are

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,940
keyed alike right so a bit later he

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:17,320
asked another police officer if he could

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:20,650
try SP in his well in his head Gus and

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:23,470
sure enough that did work so at that

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,900
time at that point in time the handcuffs

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,340
for the German police officers were he'd

00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:31,300
like to the handcuffs in the Netherlands

00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:37,290
and if you want that key you can

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:39,290
download it there that's working URL

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:44,209
let's go

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:46,339
so showing ease if I see this situation

00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:48,529
is this typical clear that's policy at

00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,360
least work environment at least that's

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:53,959
the way I see it and of course I see

00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,139
keys and that's that's from a cabinet

00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:59,630
lock and those are normally quite crappy

00:14:57,139 --> 00:15:01,790
so we can have fun with that so we put a

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:03,350
key next we could put a coin next to it

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,889
because if we take a picture of that

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,420
combination according to the key flat on

00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,339
we know the coin has to be round so we

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,930
so we know where we're dead on otherwise

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,480
the picture that work and we know the

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:16,759
size of the coin so if you print that on

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,889
a normal printer that we can check if

00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:21,949
that's the actual that's correct size

00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:23,630
right well if we know that it's crap

00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:26,480
lock and there's fair guess that it is

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,399
we can go over kindergarten on it puts a

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,139
sheet of metal behind it and cut it out

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,880
just neatly as neatly as possible and

00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:39,079
you'll end up with a t-shaped piece of

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:42,920
metal but you can stick in a lock and if

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:45,410
you pass kindergarten correctly there is

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,500
a fair chance that it'll open a lock and

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:52,779
yes it does that one got open I think

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:56,420
it's weird so showing keys is

00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:59,540
information leakage because your key is

00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:02,329
a code to your door it's not a laptop a

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,500
door probably a door or something you

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:08,440
want to protect otherwise there would

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,440
not be a lock on it right so

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:18,690
some time ago a story emerged that in

00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:21,180
New York you were able to buy keys to

00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:25,910
the subway system actually the master

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:29,760
keys to the subway system so you could

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:31,320
travel for free heck you could drive for

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:35,160
free because you could get into any

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:37,529
technical technical space or whatever so

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,410
you can I don't know to turn this off

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:42,690
that off yes no electricity whatever so

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:44,820
there was a big deal and be in America

00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,360
and being post-911 of course it was

00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,790
terrorists they want this key so this

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:56,370
ski should never be given out to the

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:58,230
masses that key and just in case we

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:00,270
can't copy keys from this picture alone

00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,760
they put it on a known nap because

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:05,130
that's the subway map of America I love

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:08,309
a love of New York so I know what that

00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:11,010
grid is so this should definitely be

00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:14,280
doable to make monkeys from for this

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:17,370
copy so instead of showing jump yeah

00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,189
there is one this ski and now they have

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:22,319
it basically because that's what we did

00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:29,970
so that's the wrong idea yep audio on

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:32,730
the up again it's a if you put your

00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,470
credit card in a machine and after that

00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:37,410
you punch a coded that same machine

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,770
that's money right as either an ATM or

00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,380
whatever if I want to if you want to

00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:45,870
leech that info so sure I want to yeah

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,020
wonder wonder what's it skim I want to

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:52,110
skim that info I in the old days you had

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,520
to make some plastic mold and put a lot

00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,380
of electronics that will not a lot but

00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:01,110
some electronics in there but it has to

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:04,380
look neat it has to pass a layman I that

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,440
it's Oh doesn't look all that looks

00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,530
legit but what if you had the key to the

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,460
box itself they could put all your crap

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:16,380
we're inside the box and the box will

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,110
still look legit because guess what it's

00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:20,850
the legit box it's the original box

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:23,520
let's take a look at the not a tiny

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,630
video let's bring an NBC Bay Area's

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,640
investigative reporter

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,770
Vicky win Vicky seems unbelievable that

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,900
one golden key so to speak unlocked so

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:32,610
many pumps we were surprised to Raj you

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,650
could call it the key to the kingdom it

00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,360
is a remnant from back in the day when

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:38,160
all gas station pumps were made with the

00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,260
same law to make it easier for

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,450
inspections and maintenance now those

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,790
keys are just providing easy access to a

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,190
very lucrative crime using new high-tech

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:51,300
technology and in the end we are all on

00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:53,580
the hook hidden behind here a new

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,530
Bluetooth enabled skimmer they can rip

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,710
off your credit or debit information in

00:18:55,530 --> 00:19:01,050
seconds this universal gas pump key is

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:07,740
making it even easier for thieves to

00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:10,260
install these new skimmer that's not an

00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,020
hard key and actually the code is not

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,810
that hard and I know which which blend

00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:19,320
to order because that's so why 11 USA it

00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:22,320
costs about fifty cents so thank you

00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,670
very much mr. newsmen I mean it keeps on

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,300
being the same they want to show that

00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:29,160
it's wrong to have key do to have a key

00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:32,070
in the open and then they put it in the

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:35,790
open okay like I said before about the

00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:37,800
New York subway system master keying so

00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,260
you have one key that opens multiple

00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:44,010
locks that's cool right I mean for a

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,050
security perspective maybe not for

00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:49,620
safety perspective that makes perfect

00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:51,960
sense again New York New York a lot of

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,880
buildings lot of high huge buildings and

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,280
suppose there's a fire in a huge

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,160
building you want the fire department to

00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:01,620
be able to get in the building right I

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,050
think we all agree on that so what you

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,790
can do is give all the keys to the fire

00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,320
department but then they need a second

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:10,560
truck to drive the keys in because

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,650
that's a lot of a lot of peace what they

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:15,990
thought about it we can't we can't or

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,090
key like all of our buildings in New

00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:21,180
York is that everybody would be able to

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:23,820
enter each other's door that would be

00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:27,150
stupid so what they did they take tiny

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,880
boxes tiny little folds well the nut

00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:32,100
folds but they're strong boxes and they

00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,830
put it outside of the building with a

00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,710
lock on it those locks are key delight

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,929
and inside that tiny little box is the

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,929
key to the actual building so now you

00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:45,480
only have to have one key walk up to a

00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:47,610
building up to the strongbox of that

00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:51,960
building open it take out the key and go

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:53,640
in to go inside so again we come to a

00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,649
situation of peace to the kingdom

00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:58,350
they're actually a couple of keys for

00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:59,580
that so you have a fireman's keyring so

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,640
that's the key ring with a couple of

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,610
keys and those will open virtually

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,480
everything in New York that's not just

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,890
New York but that's the example here hmm

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,140
of course these Kiril there's a lot of

00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,630
firemen so and it's quite hard to to

00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,330
keep something to keep keep something a

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:21,600
secret among that amount amount of

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:23,610
people but well these Keys need to be

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:29,100
duplicated and that of course happens by

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:31,830
a locksmith and a locksmith in New York

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:40,350
he retired and he had some spare stock

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:42,390
that he put on ebay legitimate story an

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,460
intrepid reporter for America's third

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,010
dumbest paper has found a slightly

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,929
disturbing item for sale on eBay former

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:50,279
locksmith Daniel Ferrara sold the

00:21:48,929 --> 00:21:52,140
undercover reporter in New York City

00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,179
fireman's key ring for a hundred and

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,640
fifty dollars the keys give the owner

00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:58,440
the ability to control elevators circuit

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,179
breakers subway entrances and traffic

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,890
lights all over the city they

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:06,299
essentially become the key maker from

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:09,990
The Matrix Reloaded media being media

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:12,779
lot of media isn't written by the body

00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:14,190
outlet you read it up because they keep

00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,140
on copying each other so they were

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,710
newspapers running this article as well

00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:21,840
with better pictures they're all

00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:23,610
straight on white background I could

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,110
even send it to schlussel and they

00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:30,960
shipped me a copy probably but then

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:33,899
again media kept on copying on that and

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,049
other outlets came with the same story

00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:41,880
again but they added also exactly for

00:22:37,049 --> 00:22:43,529
which key where it opens what what you

00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,500
should do with it and what you could do

00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:48,450
with it if you were evil so what you

00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,480
could do shut off power to the city hall

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,850
or police station house that you

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,860
said all elevators in the Empire State

00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:57,559
Building on the ground trapping

00:22:54,860 --> 00:23:00,650
everybody inside which you could do

00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,740
course massive traffic jam because that

00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:05,840
one works on all the version of all

00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:08,780
traffic lights of New York fun stuff and

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,850
then we have a fireman service ski you

00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,910
could take over the subway so or world

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:16,340
one trade center actually the key we saw

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:18,049
before so there was inflation because

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,450
this one is more expensive than than the

00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:22,400
one we head out and this one works on

00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:27,200
all the street alarm boxes so it's fun

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:30,799
stuff and actually this is lost dis last

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,140
newspaper they did think a bit about it

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,240
that's what they did they contacted a

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,090
locksmith hey actual locksmith and they

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,120
said we're gonna run this story we're

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,250
going to show pictures of keys will that

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,750
be a problem so the locksmith went like

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:50,390
I never made keys for my picture nope

00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:55,610
not a problem can't be done run the

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:58,010
story thank you so now so the story was

00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:59,840
these keys are evil shouldn't be out

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,809
there because terrorism and God knows

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,660
what and they put the keys out there

00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:08,900
because anyone who knows you who knows a

00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:11,780
bit about he's can definitely cut keys

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,950
to coat on from these pictures and if

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:18,049
not then they do not know their keys

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:21,410
okay bit closer to home this is the logo

00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:23,990
of tech inc which is a hackerspace in

00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:29,660
amsterdam and like i said i'm a member

00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:32,330
of compact 42 and well i don't know if

00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:35,570
you know hackerspaces among each other

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:39,290
but it's it's a family right like

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:41,120
siblings and siblings do call so this is

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:46,549
a little poking go renown and it's all

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:49,040
in good friendship and taking at some

00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:52,250
point got a new place which of course

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:55,160
has a new lock with a key to and one of

00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:56,419
our members he contacted one of their

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,120
members i said are you sure that's a

00:24:56,419 --> 00:25:01,130
good luck because because we have member

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,860
that knows his keys

00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,550
if he send the picture of that he then

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:11,440
maybe he can assess if it's a good luck

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:18,530
and this turned up in his mailbox well

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:24,350
if you take this picture and draw a line

00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:28,330
like this but they're neatly you end up

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:32,270
with an outline right just did that if

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:34,280
you feed this into our latest machine

00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:36,830
with helps to be laser cutter good thing

00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:41,180
it was the coffee machine then you will

00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:45,370
end up with a with a shape that has the

00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:47,840
outline of that key right make sense

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:52,390
first we label it of course because when

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,390
we have a ton of those laying about

00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:03,419
burgred we're good actually we just got

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,919
at that cutter so that's that

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,429
ventilation for the fumes again and

00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:10,950
wouldn't inhale at this point so but

00:26:08,429 --> 00:26:13,769
this is from perspex we just cut the

00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:17,850
basic shape of that he the first peg is

00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:20,000
about earlier five signal that will not

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:27,029
fit your luck at least that would be

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:28,649
that would be weird focus there you go

00:26:27,029 --> 00:26:30,990
so you end up with something like this

00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:32,940
so that's the basic shape of the lock

00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,880
but it's not a shape of the key but it's

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:39,269
not the key but the outline just draws

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,139
it's the correct one ish so what you can

00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:45,419
do and put that one on normal key

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:48,120
duplicator so on the left side you see

00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:53,519
our see-through key thingy and on the

00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:55,110
right you see the actual do right so

00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,690
then we end up with a key that might

00:26:55,110 --> 00:27:01,289
work in the front door but like I said

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:03,750
before I'm a sports lot bigger I'm not

00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:07,710
supposed hey I'm only supposed to pick

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:10,830
locks that I own or have explicit

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:14,460
permission from the actual owner to try

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,260
that so I couldn't try it but of course

00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,450
being a hackerspace which is open

00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,870
sharing we put everything on our public

00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:24,750
wiggy and some people didn't agree with

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,370
that and the problem was it does it work

00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:29,570
well that's actually the working key

00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:33,480
from from there from their new facility

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:36,480
so of course after this is was all fun

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,649
and games so we we buy them a new lock

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,850
which is way better than the one they

00:27:37,649 --> 00:27:44,399
had with supplied with 60 spare keys and

00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:47,100
there you go so it is playing around no

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:51,960
problem with that and again closer to

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:54,779
him can I get some audio on there this

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,559

00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:56,009
choleric new it is fair opened it Connie

00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:03,030
that's not picture so I don't get that

00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:06,570
story because apparently you're able in

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:08,040
Belgium to buy they'll walk to speak in

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,030
and of course it comes with three keys

00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:14,700
for actually so i don't know i don't get

00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:18,330
it i have no idea who's up that was

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:22,260
but we were able to lift some stills

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:26,880
from that piece of video that would work

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:29,730
ish that's probably better I think

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,150
that's the money shot so that was a

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:39,360
moving picture and we lifted one still

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:42,060
on it I am again with the American story

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,700
of with the big with a big lens we could

00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,830
recognize the brand of the lock by the

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,200
head of the key well if you know your

00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,860
locks you can clearly see that this is a

00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,720
bjs well you can look it up but if you

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:59,610
know your locks will see it immediately

00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:03,240
and this is basically the style sheet to

00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:05,340
that piece of luck so you know where the

00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,190
cut should be and what the possible

00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,590
depths are to that particular lock so if

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,380
you compare this picture through that

00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:17,810
one that's not going to be that hard

00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,810
right so we came up with this

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:24,990
so we thought that this would be the

00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:30,419
working key to all Belgium speed games

00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:32,519
and again of course being a sports lock

00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,610
picker I'm not allowed to big luck stat

00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,649
a doggone order they have explicit

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:40,289
permission from the actual owner to try

00:31:37,649 --> 00:31:41,880
this and i'm pretty sure i will not get

00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:49,590
explicit permission from the actual

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:51,299
order so we bought a speed kept thinking

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,059
outside the box or ignoring the box

00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:58,529
altogether and yes this happens to be

00:31:54,059 --> 00:32:02,879
the e key to all bouncer speakers so

00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:07,950
maybe we shouldn't show it slides are

00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:10,169
available so now we have been talking

00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:13,490
about pictures of peas but actually

00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:16,919
holding that key having it in your hands

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,990
for an X amount of time we can debate

00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:21,960
what X is that's of course the Holy

00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:24,330
grill because normally if you copy your

00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,110
key and you go to a coffee shop it just

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:30,659
takes a black and well a black that is

00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:33,149
the same ish and copies the code on that

00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:36,330
key right I mean it just copies the

00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:39,480
ridges but what if you would have a key

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:41,690
that has a weird shape a weird luck shed

00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:46,110
so that piece of metal that has to go in

00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,669
doesn't exist or is hard to get so you

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:49,289
have some locks that you could only

00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:52,559
duplicate if you have two plastic card

00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:55,169
well not really necessary because there

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,309
are machines like this then of

00:32:55,169 --> 00:33:00,690
expensive but not that technically

00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:04,379
basically he does the same its scan

00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:08,340
sticky and Mills that shape out of a

00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:12,539
piece of metal but from another angle it

00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,340
takes slugs of brass like so smiley

00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:17,610
faces on it so you know you could do and

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:20,340
what it does it Mills those groups of

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:23,580
the other side see so this one is not

00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,399
cut as a key but as a key shape that

00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,639
makes sense is even closer so it

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,370
basically Mills the shape of the blank

00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:34,580
heat

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:38,280
so even if you have a protected key

00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:40,560
shape sorry to be you that can be

00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,480
covered I love quite expensive machine

00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:44,280
but it's not out of this world expensive

00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,360
it's it's I don't know five six thousand

00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,710
dollars euros so as it normal cuz you

00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,390
were you won't buy this but if you're

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,240
even a tech are you sure this is

00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:57,930
investment or if your locksmith or a

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,260
hobby sports that doesn't work but even

00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:02,760
without expensive machinery you can do

00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:04,730
stuff with physical objects that you

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,570
want to have a metal coffee front-run

00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:12,110
we've been doing that for ages right so

00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:17,760
what can you do how are these made

00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:23,490
anyone sorry no they're metal that how

00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:26,040
are they made molt yes they're put into

00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:29,250
them all which of course you can do with

00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:30,659
keys as well so you can go all James

00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:32,790
bonny on that because that's what

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,730
that's that you see that happen in the

00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:38,429
movie and if it's not a very high and

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:41,010
lock than a work we tried that with

00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:44,700
normal keys and put some clay just

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:48,960
little clay that you get from the store

00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:51,929
the crafts store this term get some come

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:54,480
some fast melting metal not let cuz

00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:58,920
that's and unhealthy and that's bit too

00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,410
brittle I've actually too too soft so

00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,620
you have to find the exact spot but it

00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:07,170
does work if you have higher spec keys

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:10,290
you need a well then clay doesn't work

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,500
because it's it's it's a actually it

00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:15,840
expands a bit if you heat it so but the

00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,840
stuff that your dentist use makes

00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,540
impression on your teeth if he makes

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,520
copies from basically he's copying that

00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,050
stuff two components tough brilliance

00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,480
quite expensive so it's good to be

00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:29,910
friends a dentist's if you want to try

00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,160
this but it does work experiment a bit

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:34,650
in the Dieselworks and even if you look

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,510
at the key on the right that's quite

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:39,570
hard to duplicate with a normal

00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:41,950
locksmith or normal keep copying service

00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,780
will say no no no not going to happen

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:47,260
you do need a God for that but even then

00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:51,940
it's hard different angles but you can

00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:54,640
buy kits for the the Nall locks that

00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,990
half there fabrice special clay and very

00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,329
special metal and a tee thingy and baby

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,099
powder baby powder is used to powder the

00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:07,270
clay before you put the key in otherwise

00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:10,570
it'll it'll it'll stick and it will

00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:14,170
deform your your mold so that it will

00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:15,609
look stupid and not work and the end

00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,040
result will be something like this on

00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:20,829
top is the original one at the bottom st

00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,630
copy it does it look the same but if you

00:36:20,829 --> 00:36:26,349
look at the actual parts that that will

00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:28,660
touch your key the same and if you take

00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:30,550
it out of your moles with some care you

00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:32,859
might not destroy the mold so even if

00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:34,930
that key doesn't work cause you put not

00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:36,849
enough liquid in air or something like

00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:40,810
that you can try that mold again because

00:36:36,849 --> 00:36:45,359
you have that mole so just pressing a

00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:48,460
key into a soft material could be enough

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,980
to steal the information that's actually

00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:53,380
on the key so it depends on the

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,810
environment you're in but if you're at

00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:00,180
the wrong spot at the wrong time losing

00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:02,680
sight of your key means the key is lost

00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:06,730
so if you're miss your key you can

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,470
consider it lost if after that you find

00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:11,680
it again you could consider it a

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:14,170
souvenir but not a working key anymore

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,730
because other people have it as well the

00:37:14,170 --> 00:37:19,900
same as your password you're not about

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:24,220
you're not supposed to share it okay we

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:29,109
saw a number of clips showing media

00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:30,880
showing keys this will program I do hope

00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:33,819
that I do not have to explain with these

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,220
guys he's a hacker he's one of good guys

00:37:33,819 --> 00:37:39,569
he understands security let's see how he

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,569
does are you

00:37:54,750 --> 00:38:05,710
epi nice to see an 80 year old another

00:37:59,069 --> 00:38:08,410
old stadium sure to post a letter about

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,869
follow animal it's a form of its special

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,670
model into some of the elephant sorry

00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,670
because Ray's mistake

00:38:41,600 --> 00:39:02,960
that's okay sighs lift well

00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:17,680
then you have hackers in your nuclear

00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:20,630
bunker what's wrong with this picture

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:26,630
it's a bit out of focus still what's

00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:29,749
wrong with this picture it's shown true

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,859
you've been paying attention there's no

00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:36,499
chance in hell that's the actual key

00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:39,349
this is a cabinet key this is not a key

00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:40,940
that is used in an elevator the key that

00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:44,239
was used in the elevator has teeth on

00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:46,609
one side not both they just took a key

00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:48,829
that they had laying about as showed it

00:39:46,609 --> 00:39:51,109
to the camera but you guys didn't notice

00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:53,630
the tension was still there the drama

00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:55,309
was still there I mean there's a special

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,739
hey there's a secret key which you can

00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:01,210
get dis icky that we use it it would go

00:39:57,739 --> 00:40:06,289
in it took nothing away from the story

00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:10,190
to show a different key so why doesn't

00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:11,749
media do this all the time if I ask you

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:15,529
give me your password and you say

00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:18,079
welcome 123 it's a password I surely

00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:21,380
hope it's not yours but it might satisfy

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,019
my need for your password so if you want

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:27,739
for some dramatic reason or whatever

00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:31,039
show a key in a picture shall we key in

00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:34,549
the picture see if I care just do not

00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:36,890
show the key at you actually future okay

00:40:34,549 --> 00:40:39,049
then what can't we show keys anymore we

00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:42,619
walk around with these right if we use

00:40:39,049 --> 00:40:44,479
them all the time well this is a way to

00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:46,729
fix it that's a key port that's the way

00:40:44,479 --> 00:40:48,410
it's called it's basically your older

00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:51,200
that you can slide your peas in and out

00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:52,969
right so we have a box with head sukizo

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,160
if you want to use that key slide it up

00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:57,890
can also keep it in your warning in

00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,440
Europe but in your bag or whatever but

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:03,109
that's what it does so it takes it's a

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,589
box and it takes sliding thingies that

00:41:03,109 --> 00:41:08,329
you could put sorts of things on and

00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:10,910
well actually if you look at the fourth

00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:13,069
key from the left that's a blankie so

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:15,440
you have to take it to a locksmith and

00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:18,469
he'll cut the actual code in it but

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,810
still these guys have to know what type

00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:21,420
of

00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,820
lang to put in there so in also in order

00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:28,640
to do that they say just send us a

00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:32,640
picture of your key so you're selling an

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,080
added security thing two guys that are

00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:37,110
paranoid otherwise you're not going to

00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:41,160
buy this and you tell them snap pictures

00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:44,040
of your key come on but fair to say as a

00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:46,980
for added security Danny print they said

00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:48,450
you can put some some paper on the

00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,870
actual bidding so we can't read that

00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:55,590
that shouldn't be added security

00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:59,100
actually it's this is labeled DEFCON so

00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:01,860
it's it's it is branded for a security

00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:04,550
conference that is supposed to be the

00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:08,970
most hostile digital place on earth and

00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:10,440
for people who are there and don't want

00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:12,840
to show the picture don't want to show

00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,570
their keys this shouldn't be added

00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:17,700
security it should be the default if you

00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,850
want a picture of the shape of your key

00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:27,900
tell your users to block the actual

00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:32,640
information come on so we know this is

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:35,780
stupid right this shouldn't be but for

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,090
the same thing I think this shouldn't be

00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,230
this is a website it's called please

00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,230
break Duff in

00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:50,340
what he did he made a engine that looks

00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:54,210
at the twitter feed and he just searches

00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:59,640
for i have new key and does it include a

00:42:54,210 --> 00:43:02,400
picture if yes he puts it on this so you

00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:06,420
see all pictures of keys that are new

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,609
and well these you just say well that

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,250
wasn't location is fargo when you as a

00:43:08,609 --> 00:43:13,830
well that's a big town but if you click

00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:18,630
through when you actually come you you

00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:21,840
see the the actual twitter post and of

00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:24,210
course it says Turlock California if you

00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:27,900
click on that you'll get the map of

00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:30,210
where exactly in tirar it is and you

00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,990
have a picture of the actual house I'm

00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:36,690
pretty sure there's a plug-in be able to

00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:40,290
written that does some some Oh some

00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:42,690
Street few different thingy whatever and

00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:43,830
that's the key and of course you know

00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:46,080
it's through the features so you

00:43:43,830 --> 00:43:48,480
probably can figure out when he's on

00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:54,000
holiday so I think that's a stupid idea

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:58,320
to put your keys on Twitter actually but

00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,599
that's a different story because having

00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,280
sight of your keys can be enough to

00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,940
leaked that information that's actually

00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,560
important I and showing your keys or

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,119
what is showing what we saw in the

00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:12,960
beginning that you can take a picture

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,690
from stupid distances and still be able

00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,880
to make he's from so who's watching and

00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:21,230
where if you live in London there's a

00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:23,400
gazillion see CCTVs all around you and

00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:26,550
there's well you don't see him that

00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:29,280
often vs glass holes and they're working

00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:32,900
on on Google contact lenses so you can't

00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:36,660
even see that and all of you guys have

00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:41,130
quite good cameras on them called

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:44,970
telephones nowadays but I mean people

00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:47,940
could be looking at you all the time so

00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:52,260
if you use your key I sure nobody's

00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:53,700
watching some time ago when there was an

00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,220
ad

00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,520
what was a terrific I think that that

00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:01,350
said well if you punch in your PIN code

00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,430
she live we can do that with keys right

00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:08,850
I mean you're basically using your

00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:10,800
password right cuz your key is the best

00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:14,340
put you in Jordan was i before it right

00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:18,150
but so if you use it make sure people

00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,760
that looking or use like that okay one

00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:27,630
final one then I'll let you go to the

00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:30,330
extreme this is a bad man he's actually

00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:34,200
a killer another because he got

00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:39,000
convicted for a murder it was put in

00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:44,190
jail and he walked out because the

00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,690
design of the master key was printed on

00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:47,790
front of the prisoners information

00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:50,310
handbook and a copy of that particular

00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:53,450
book was given to all inmates upon

00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,450
arrival of that facility

00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:04,270
so security can be hard sometimes

00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:13,610
security can be easy but up your

00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,650
security that's always easy so that's

00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:19,490
basically my talk and I have a final

00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:25,760
bombshell thing where is it which I'm

00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:34,480
not allowed to do for some reason it's a

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:37,280
operating system shut up ok hello guitar

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,110
there's the hackerspace a couple of

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:41,360
hundred meters that away ish i'm pretty

00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:44,030
sure people got to do it she never been

00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,760
to one please go to that one and if you

00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:52,790
ever in close by autumn cousin equity

00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:57,770
two and done thank you very much any

00:46:52,790 --> 00:47:00,880
questions this one is it might hear what

00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:00,880
do you have we have a working thing

00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:09,990
with your please break in you showed

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,520
that people can get to a house and they

00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,760
can say they have the key to break in

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,869
and all that it takes about 10 seconds

00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,609
to smash a window true so by the time

00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:22,589
you're going to the hassle of finding

00:47:20,609 --> 00:47:24,390
someone in a town somewhere on the

00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:26,010
internet and making a copy of their key

00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:31,289
it's much easier just to break the

00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:33,569
window true security isn't just security

00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:37,049
is not on and off that's true security

00:47:33,569 --> 00:47:39,750
is not just that thing but what I try to

00:47:37,049 --> 00:47:42,210
get across is suppose you have any

00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:45,930
computer and you want to secure that

00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:49,109
computer if you know nothing about IT

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,210
security who might go heard something

00:47:49,109 --> 00:47:55,500
about a thing that's called a firewall

00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:57,960
we need a 50 a firewall and then it's

00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,849
secure rule number one can be any any

00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,339
but it has a firewall so it must be

00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:04,740
secure so the analog is if you have a

00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:10,890
door and you want to secure it not all

00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:14,490
locks will secure it it has well these

00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:16,500
have a protocol like if you have a

00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,450
firewall and everybody can access that

00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:21,930
in admin mode then it's not a firewall

00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:23,700
anymore and if you have a a door with

00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:26,490
the key on it and everybody has access

00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:29,279
to that key and it's not a lock anymore

00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:31,980
I can tell you what my security criteria

00:48:29,279 --> 00:48:34,710
is for the love of my ass yep will the

00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:39,809
insurance company pay out if something

00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:41,819
gets stolen that I spoke to a quite some

00:48:39,809 --> 00:48:44,430
years ago that it was still living in a

00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:48,089
fraternity house and he said if you ever

00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:52,140
come to your room and is alluded you

00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:54,470
don't see any signs of a break-in just

00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:57,299
lock the door and kick the door in

00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,480
that's what he said that was his expert

00:48:57,299 --> 00:49:03,250
opinion on that

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,350
it of course it all depends on what

00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:08,200
you're securing and it all depends on

00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:09,970
your personal risk profile or your

00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,000
personal actually on the perception of

00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:15,670
your own personal risk profile I mean

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,730
yeah I know people who don't have that

00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:21,670
much so they probably will not get

00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:24,190
looted they do have some miss the

00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,360
computers the rest I don't have that

00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:28,030
much but they have a cool computer you

00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:29,800
can make that it is maybe not just your

00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:31,840
computer but there's this data on your

00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:34,240
computer right and then there's

00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:36,970
different doors I mean your door you

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:40,180
might not find important that's Toby up

00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:43,240
to you but at work you have a computer

00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,550
room lets me what happens there and what

00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:48,310
could happen there because if I show up

00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:51,520
to your computer room door your serve a

00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:54,220
door and a kick that door in that's not

00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:56,890
much fun right because then I can get in

00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:00,490
and steal the stuff it's way cooler to

00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:02,770
break in and start sniffing stuff good

00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,190
stuff in take stuff out I've got another

00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:07,750
cool story yeah job I'm going to be

00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:08,980
telling this part of this story for the

00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:11,770
healthcare thing and I'm doing tomorrow

00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:14,590
for the collab conference as well we had

00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:16,540
a server room and put fire regulation

00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,190
reasons it had to be part of the fire

00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:19,360
escape as well going through that server

00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,270
room which meant it had to have an

00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:23,950
external door on it this server room was

00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,650
locked with a key that I wasn't given

00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:27,910
because I was only in ite development of

00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:30,150
that stage and other people were taking

00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,410
over the stove a thing hmm I

00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,300
demonstrated at one point with two

00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:36,250
knives taking from the kitchen that I

00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,570
could walk to the door outside shove one

00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,240
knife up against the wall shove the

00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:42,370
other one in and leave the lock opened

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:44,920
room without having to touch the key

00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:47,760
let's wait around the key is not always

00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,860
you true yeah i mean like i said before

00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:55,540
was disgusting fires in New York

00:50:50,860 --> 00:51:00,340
buildings that some safety measures are

00:50:55,540 --> 00:51:01,540
not stupid but they either way of your

00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,210
security they could either way of

00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:07,840
security so any measure you take has to

00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:10,300
be valid and that's basically it all is

00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:13,300
I mean what do I want I mean you can

00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:15,010
make stuff very secure in a way that

00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:17,590
users will never use it because it's

00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:19,690
unusable I mean if and same with

00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:25,150
computers if I have passports that

00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:27,460
should be 120 characters long show you

00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:30,850
can you can enable that but people use

00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:34,350
it so it's always a trainer any more

00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:34,350
questions there's one

00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:47,400
yep just been reformed that's the last

00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:49,440
question quality strong a bit like it's

00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,600
actually a response not really question

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,760
okay if you're kicking the door or your

00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:55,290
break the window somebody knows that

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,240
you've been like I said yeah same as

00:51:55,290 --> 00:51:59,400
with the serpent room door take that in

00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:01,350
you know this is it it's really worrying

00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:04,260
if you don't know somebody went in there

00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:10,050
yep I mean and it's not just taking away

00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:12,950
stuff you can also add stuff that's it

00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:12,950
