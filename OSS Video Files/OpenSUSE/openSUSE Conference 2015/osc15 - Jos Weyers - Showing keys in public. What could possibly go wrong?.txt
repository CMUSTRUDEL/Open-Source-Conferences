Title: osc15 - Jos Weyers - Showing keys in public. What could possibly go wrong?
Publication date: 2015-05-02
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	A password shouldnâ€™t be on a post-it note.
In plain view.
On the console.
The password to a locked door is called a key.
So if a reporter wants to get the point across that certain people shouldn't have access to a particular key, would it be wise for said reporter to show that key to the world?
This talk will show how not to run this story, why we should care and maybe make you rethink your physical security a bit.
