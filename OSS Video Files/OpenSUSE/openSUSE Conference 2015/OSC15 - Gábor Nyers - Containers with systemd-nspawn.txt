Title: OSC15 - GÃ¡bor Nyers - Containers with systemd-nspawn
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	While probably the most prominent, Docker is not the only tool for building and managing containers. Originally meant to be a "chroot on steroids" to help debug systemd, systemd-nspawn provides a fairly uncomplicated approach to work with containers. Being part of systemd, it is available on most recent distributions out-of-the-box and requires no additional dependencies.

This talk will introduce the concepts involved in containers and will guide you through the steps of building a container from scratch. The payload will be a simple service, which will be automatically activated by systemd when the first request arrives.
