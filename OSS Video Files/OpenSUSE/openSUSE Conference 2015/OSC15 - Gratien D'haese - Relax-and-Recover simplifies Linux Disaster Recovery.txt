Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Linux Disaster Recovery exercises are not every day tasks and most system engineers lack experience how to practice them. This talk will describe the basic knowledge about Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC) and go deeper into the different aspects of each.
However, we will also show you how to start up DR plan and explain some handy tools, such as Relax and Recover (rear) so you can get started and being prepared.
Rear can store the details about your systems on disks (NAS, USB, SAN,...) or network (PXE, NFS, CIFS,...) including the complete backup. It also creates a bootable image which you need to recreate your system from scratch.
Furthermore, thanks to the modular concept, we can integrate rear with foreign backup solutions (commercial or not) to do the backup and restore part which makes rear very scalable in big enterprises. Rear scales even with Cloud solutions and is the heart of another great project (drlm or disaster recovery linux manager).
