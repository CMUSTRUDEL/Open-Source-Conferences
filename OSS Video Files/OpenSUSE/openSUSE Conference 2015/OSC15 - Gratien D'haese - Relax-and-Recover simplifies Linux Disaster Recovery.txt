Title: OSC15 - Gratien D'haese - Relax-and-Recover simplifies Linux Disaster Recovery
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Linux Disaster Recovery exercises are not every day tasks and most system engineers lack experience how to practice them. This talk will describe the basic knowledge about Disaster Recovery (DR) and Business Continuity (BC) and go deeper into the different aspects of each.
However, we will also show you how to start up DR plan and explain some handy tools, such as Relax and Recover (rear) so you can get started and being prepared.
Rear can store the details about your systems on disks (NAS, USB, SAN,...) or network (PXE, NFS, CIFS,...) including the complete backup. It also creates a bootable image which you need to recreate your system from scratch.
Furthermore, thanks to the modular concept, we can integrate rear with foreign backup solutions (commercial or not) to do the backup and restore part which makes rear very scalable in big enterprises. Rear scales even with Cloud solutions and is the heart of another great project (drlm or disaster recovery linux manager).

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,230
let's start for this afternoon after

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,480
imperfect lunch break thank you for the

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,260
organization for providing an fine meal

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,540
for everybody we appreciate it the first

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,120
arc in this afternoon in this room will

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,310
be about relaxing recover that's

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,710
concerning disaster recovery for Linux

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,210
environments and we will try to explain

00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,849
it how make life easier for you but

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,939
before we dig in let's first start about

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:33,450
myself a little bird my name is classy

00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:36,960
and aza I'm from Belgium from Antwerp so

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:41,489
it's not that far away I'm already very

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,430
long time busy with UNIX I used to call

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,260
me and ceiling consulted well as I'm a

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,649
senior now just call me an expert

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,050
consultants as fart filmed I'm already

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,270
involved in very long time if unix and

00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,850
linux projects also going to belgian

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,030
accuses group in the time and have some

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:02,430
open source projects the most known is

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,090
probably relaxing recover but also

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,100
involved in others they are listed here

00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:10,740
maybe config to HTML is ringing a bell

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,369
I'm the goatee developer for linux lab

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,409
and also for the main track for hpx some

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,220
other projects they are all on my

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:24,540
teacher and my home pages ok before we

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,299
dig into disaster recovery itself let's

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,720
put the picture right business community

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,790
is about how to restore your business as

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:39,240
soon as possible and then disasters or

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:41,759
curing disaster recovery or a recovery

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,549
plan is only a part of the whole picture

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,430
as you can see here they're full four

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:50,700
main domains and business continuity and

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:53,970
where we focus today is only a part of

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:57,860
it the recovery plan and their fits

00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:01,460
relax recover okay have another talk

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:04,049
especially about the business community

00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,540
but already gave that not here but

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,399
somewhere else that explains the

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,710
complete business continuity plans and

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,570
all the steps

00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:16,820
how to make a good plan but okay

00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:19,400
recovery plans first of all I hope you

00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:23,240
all have one and big one small one at

00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,890
least something these things is may be

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:29,330
funny on a picture but in real life it

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:32,840
is a it's a real drama so be be paired

00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:36,500
and do something about it a recovery

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,310
plan for your technical equipment are

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,370
for the main streets are important it's

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:46,040
about the uptime you want your equipment

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,070
as soon as possible up again it's about

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:51,980
the trustworthy if you do a recovery of

00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:53,960
a system you have to rely on it that

00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,640
it's working but at least that your

00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,350
computer is back online as soon as

00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,910
possible i'm not whole broken and that

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,880
you still have to do under steps

00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:04,220
manually so you have to drain it and

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,730
that's the key word about it and the

00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:11,330
cost it has to be affordable as we are

00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:15,260
in the open source world there are some

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,180
open source packets available to make

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:20,090
your Linux disaster recovery possible

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,200
relaxing recoveries one of them and the

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:28,640
other that's also very famous is diamond

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,650
the rescue I forgot to mention before I

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,620
wrote start with relax recover had

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,630
another project called make cd-rom

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,160
recovery which is also a Linux deserve

00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:43,430
recovery project but to get away from

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,950
German colleague slow-mo sapiro we

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,880
rewrote it from scratch and that was the

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:51,770
birth of relaxer recover in 2006 and by

00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,930
the way I think it only took us five

00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:56,780
weeks to make the first release of

00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:59,390
relaxing recover that's because we took

00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:02,390
the best of lomas project which was the

00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:03,920
framework and we took the complete

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,100
knowledge of makes it drama recovered

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,650
and that I wrote so I could easily make

00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,460
it happen and I will explain it how it

00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:16,580
is becoming possible to add something to

00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:20,390
answer on the complexity because I was

00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:23,690
fading away from the topics we tend to

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:27,169
make our plans to complex as a rule of

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,270
thumb if you go away today ki the KISS

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,960
principle keep it as simple as possible

00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:35,270
as a key for success at least for your

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,490
computer environment business community

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:43,190
is much more complex and but that's

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:45,950
another topic keep it simple and to make

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:49,190
your life easier we wrote relax and

00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:52,850
recover the name I chose the name

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,669
because it would be to become a relaxed

00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:57,860
process to recover in the relax way

00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:02,150
that's why i call jose realize the

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:05,120
recovery and the acronym is real it is a

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:08,540
disaster recovery framework and it uses

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,600
workflows we will see it a little bit

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,550
later the nice thing about real is it

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,380
completely is written in bass language

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,660
so it's written for system

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:21,229
administrators and you can easily add

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:25,040
your own stuff in it so you can extend

00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:27,490
it deploy is easy once you have tested

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:30,620
it you have to trust in it you can just

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,330
put it on your system make your

00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:36,260
configure don't you raise your file

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:38,000
complete and that's it and you just put

00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,520
it in a crown that's automatically done

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,160
by the way if something changes on your

00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,810
file systems on your kernel

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,120
automatically it will know that and it

00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,040
will recreate an image and disaster

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,270
recovery image and even in backup if

00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:55,430
needed it integrates in various linux

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,960
technologies it does Vera Colonel

00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:59,090
pursues Alan's less environment on the

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,700
redheads environment on you boom tools

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:06,710
and that's more linux distributions

00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,990
another important thing is it has an

00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,470
internal integration of your backup

00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:14,419
using renewed our or our sink and that

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,270
it can easily be extended or it is

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:21,410
extended all ready for open source

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:23,450
backup solutions burials bacala for

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:28,320
example or even commercial backup

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:30,860
solutions and the recovery system

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:34,170
should be as easy as possible of course

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:36,980
but the most important thing is as other

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:40,530
solutions everything can be done online

00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:42,390
so you can just run your rear emits your

00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,520
backup solution and your disaster

00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:46,680
recovery image creation online and

00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,660
nobody will know it affect because you

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,820
can just schedule it it will be done

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,290
automatically if it's a scheduled fire

00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:57,480
crumb so that's the nice thing about it

00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:00,150
so what is here i'll write the messenger

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,970
that there are developers in germany

00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:05,130
like slow-mo there's also a new

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:10,800
developer johannes max nur his firm's

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:12,180
less from level as very brand here we

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,230
wrote together the better FS

00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:20,580
implementation force less effect already

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:22,200
said it is best we we do know one

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:24,780
limitation is the colonel to the

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,570
opposite but as we are already beyond

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:29,790
two three that doesn't matter anymore it

00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:34,310
supports almost any kind of hardware

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:37,560
hardware solution rates integrations lvm

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:41,340
any kind of file system is almost

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:45,450
supported and integration with network

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:50,220
solutions like NFS safes can use rsync

00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:54,060
USB and boot media dvds eyes or images

00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:57,150
can boot from USB storage and also from

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,360
the lamb and even boot built a tour

00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:02,430
through who uses bootable tapes anymore

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,470
don't know but it still works it's their

00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:09,170
one better disaster recovery solution

00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:12,600
everybody's heard some to work at ok

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,910
important thing is real focus is main

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:18,600
focus is on disaster recovery recovery

00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,790
not on the backup ok the reason the

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:23,330
degrees and let the backup software you

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,460
have the possibility have a full backup

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:29,370
integration if newt are our sink or if

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,170
you use an external backup solution you

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,789
don't care because your external backup

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,820
solution will take care of the full

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,560
backup so your only focus then on the

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:42,680
creation of the disaster recovery image

00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:45,660
itself that's what we're saying here

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,650
come back to that later so real use the

00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:52,620
best tool for the job disaster recovery

00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:55,200
but before we start using real you have

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,360
to make some decisions and one of those

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,250
this season is its back and make an

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,060
easement will I use will I use the

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:04,920
internal one I must say safety percent

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,780
is using the interval but a lot of

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,650
customers are using external backup

00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:14,190
solution and quite a lot of commercial

00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:17,880
one like TSM let backup day protector

00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:21,120
and some others so you can use the

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,770
internal or external one and then you

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,890
have to decide where your backups will

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:29,610
recite one rule of thumb is make sure

00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:32,730
that your backup archives are stored on

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:35,880
a remote environment remote data center

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,650
in your disk not in the same besides

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,300
your computer's of course and because if

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,180
your computer's are broke or fire or

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,940
fluid it then you lose also the data so

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,130
keep that in mind if the cloud storage

00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:51,300
is possible if duplicity is also

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:55,800
integrated and the remote network store

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:58,920
it well it's NFS saves the cloud storage

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,530
for example it's all possible rsync is a

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,290
possibility so you can really use a

00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:06,510
remote stuff there's another one this is

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:10,230
Q shot self file system ever heard of

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,890
that it's as I said FS it's very quite

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,320
well I use it quite a lot it's a kind of

00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:19,410
cloud backup so I use it to another

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,860
small data center to make backups of

00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:25,110
smaller computers because you have to be

00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,200
aware if you use the internet then

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,240
you're going to have lots of terabytes

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,710
over the internet because that's taking

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,780
too long the media already amazing

00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,990
external store it's quite important

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,000
never keep your storage of your backup

00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,480
besides your computer but somewhere else

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,060
and already miss it the boot media can

00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,500
be a CD iso image can be over the

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,990
network USB and you can have

00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,880
volta factor you can boot from the nice

00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,640
image but you can store your media or

00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:00,320
your backup media on an NFS share save

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,330
share or somewhere else so you can

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:09,040
really differentiate that's all

00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:09,040
definable via the configuration files

00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:19,370
how does it work the first thing that

00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,950
really doing is storing your disk lee

00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,920
out because the thing is if you want to

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,540
recreate your data you need your file

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:28,400
systems up and running first so

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,250
therefore you need the notes about your

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,490
disk the sizing of you this the sizing

00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,990
of your file systems but it's kind of

00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:38,060
file systems which article eight

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,640
characteristics of your file systems etc

00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,830
etc also the labels and also the

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,960
bootloader is important and because if

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,860
you system is no bootable that's a bit

00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:51,230
of a problem store the files that's

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:53,600
through the variant mechanism that's are

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,870
available can be unaffected you can use

00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:00,920
star or sink etc then you have to create

00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:03,260
a bootable rescue image so it will copy

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,900
affect all the nice executables that it

00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,690
needs to recreate your computer after

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:12,110
failure so everything will be only one

00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,750
image and it's all all the executables

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,120
the limeys are from your life system so

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,530
there is no problem that it cannot work

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,410
because they're coming from the same

00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:24,110
source effect so there is no problem if

00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:26,750
life is a stuff like that already

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,300
mentioned everything is done online and

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,310
it's whole present compatible well if

00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,310
it's from the same source that's logical

00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:41,630
the rescue media if it's an ISO image of

00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:44,060
USB death doesn't matter it contains all

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:46,850
the executables that need to recreate

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:49,190
your file systems to make your system

00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,870
bootable and even if you have an

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,630
integration with an external backup

00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:55,660
solution are all the executors that the

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:59,030
client needs to communicate with the

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:01,020
backup server are also included so

00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,110
that's the integration of the

00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,850
remote backup software is there and of

00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:07,290
course everything that the colonel needs

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,960
the device drives and network

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,630
configuration every knee is there you

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,090
can the boot image magnet boots you can

00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,180
have the same IP address as from the

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:21,360
source you can have in 1080p you can

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,400
define your own IP addresses you can

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,940
redefine it there are several ways to

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:29,640
make that happen and everything is done

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,250
in RAM so in the innocent ramdisk so

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:34,500
that means that the rescue means is

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,640
running in RAM and everything else all

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:41,910
your disks is then free to use to make

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:44,370
it home partition it to mount your file

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,260
systems make the file systems melted

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:51,620
make it ready for the restoration of

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:54,840
your data so how it is done in practice

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:57,900
so you boot from the rescue in it it

00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,710
will restore your disks so it will see

00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,090
if it's kind of this are there it will

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,220
ask them if it's not home percent the

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,230
same it is an interactive menu that

00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:10,410
comes up then that will tell you update

00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,180
this disk do you notice this yes then ok

00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,610
it will reformat it create your

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,700
partitions even the hardware rate can be

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:21,690
reconfigured if needed create a file

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:24,000
systems make the files ready label it if

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:25,680
needed and then when they are mounted

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,550
then they are ready for restore the

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:31,290
backup data once that is done we store

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,470
the bootloader reboot and then it's

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,330
finished it's as simple as that that's

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,120
what I mean with the relaxing part it

00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:42,270
should be a simple start to come out

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,290
restore rear restore will recover and

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:49,140
then after a few minutes if it's a small

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,880
limits in vm for example let's write

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:55,710
down within less than two minutes you

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:58,350
have your system back furthermore this

00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:01,470
can also be used for migration it is

00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,630
used from P to V V to V and V to pee

00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:06,840
there are customers who are using that

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,270
for really migrating their data from

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,960
physical systems to virtual systems that

00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,960
really works

00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:18,049
so where's the backup software already

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,749
messaged there this is the list of the

00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:25,629
external backup integrations which are

00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:28,549
already in place some of those were

00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:31,579
affect sponsored sponsoring means that

00:15:28,549 --> 00:15:34,639
they hire me or some other consultant to

00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:37,040
do the integration but it's all once

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,689
integrated it stays in the software and

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,429
it's all over source the integration

00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:45,170
part this is the cloud duplicity some

00:15:43,429 --> 00:15:47,869
people already heard of it of using it

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:49,759
it's very nice I like it it's all

00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:51,799
encrypted nice encrypted and it goes

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,649
over the you can really use it in the

00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:57,470
ground and the integration works quite

00:15:54,649 --> 00:16:00,110
well our sink is also one of my

00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:02,029
favorites pure our sink and then you

00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:04,509
have of course the it's a lot of

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:07,939
customers you are using this detar

00:16:04,509 --> 00:16:10,850
combination with an S filer effect and

00:16:07,939 --> 00:16:14,389
then there were a lot of gigabytes of

00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:17,089
data on the nests okay other customers

00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:18,350
are preferring commercial solution

00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:20,449
because they already have that in place

00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,069
in the full backups and then only make

00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:24,919
the rescue limits put a 10-1 on the

00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:28,160
nests or even make the back up inside

00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:30,499
their commercial solution and then if

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,929
they wanted to just restore the ISO to

00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:36,470
another system booted and then restore

00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:41,139
and the complete system from the backup

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:44,029
server so extending this is very easy

00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:46,910
some people are doing themselves and

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:49,699
then the submit a pull request we

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,759
recheck it where most of times we need

00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,619
to do some tricks and tricks and about

00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:58,579
it because it's not always whole percent

00:16:54,619 --> 00:17:00,860
correctly done and i say i already have

00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,689
written several of these integrations

00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,360
myself and other people correct me

00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:07,669
because when there's a new web great

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,740
sometimes a library new library comes in

00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,630
but that's the nice thing about open

00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,669
software it's a it's a combination of

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,880
several factors of people that are

00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:19,900
working together and that's what i like

00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:23,920
even I make mistakes of course

00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:26,860
the network integration that's the nice

00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:30,910
thing if you have a very big data center

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:33,280
with tiles of linux systems it is not

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,650
always simple to make for every system

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,340
and eyes or image so therefore a lot of

00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:41,230
customers are using the network parts or

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,440
booting over the network via pixie

00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,390
booting that is of course possible the

00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,090
philosophy and the methodology is

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:51,520
exactly the same as far as or you just

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,830
retrieve your initial R and race from

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,680
the network you build and then you have

00:17:53,830 --> 00:18:00,580
of course the probably the the archives

00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:02,560
fire NFS available maybe we're to

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,890
mention there is a new project written

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,570
by three or four Spanish guys from

00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,730
Barcelona over in the neighborhood of

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,190
Barcelona is the disaster recovery and

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:17,320
Linux manager that's a fact a real

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:20,080
server that can have some boosters out

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:22,810
the to make a new image and if you want

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,570
to recover you use the disaster recovery

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,820
linux manager to make the initial

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,040
request to start a recovery that's all

00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,250
over the network so that's a nice thing

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:41,170
and they're using the same framework as

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:43,930
readers to make that happen so if you

00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:45,730
want to get started with rear and yeah

00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:48,310
at least you need to be able to download

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:52,500
it as it is open source we have a

00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:52,500
website it's called relax and recover

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:59,080
you have stable and you have snapshots

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,820
that are built daily if there is a

00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:04,360
change of course and it's automatically

00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:07,690
triggered and the official sources are

00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:12,190
on Jetta so you can just clone it and

00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:14,290
start your own rear development if you

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:16,720
want it and from their own that's what I

00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:18,550
prefer if you have some updates you make

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,370
your own clone and then you can make a

00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:23,380
pull request and send it to the to the

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,580
head of rear and this is the head of

00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:30,040
growth real is also a very long time

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,660
integrated in some official repositories

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,960
like in the feed

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:37,540
and also in the less my drains less it's

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,090
already i think from 2008 if i'm not

00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:44,740
mistaken available a strike of the high

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:47,440
availability track of less i'll be at a

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,170
bit behind i'm working with your harness

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,210
meixner to get the one dot 17 which is

00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:55,810
still the latest release in the new

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:58,570
hitch a so probably in the new service

00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,580
packet will be in there so we just with

00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:05,500
the seeker install you can just install

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:08,620
it down the installation is as easy as

00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,900
that if you download the RPM and you

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,140
need if you want to use the eyes or

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,050
linux sis linux but mostly that's

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,450
already part if you want to use NFS you

00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:22,810
need some declines or six lines or sink

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,820
and open soo open secure shell is i

00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:29,260
think that standard in each distribution

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:31,030
these days on most of the times if

00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:33,190
something is missing you will get an

00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:35,350
error message in the rear and then you

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:41,620
see it in low files then you can install

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:45,280
it what's missing ok to get going the

00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:49,300
backup flows if you're using the

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,430
internal backflow then it's Donette FS

00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:53,710
is the mostly used or if you are using

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,900
our sink then you can say say arson so

00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,660
it's back up equals data fess then it

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,330
means you will be using NFS to store

00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:05,170
your archives somewhere it doesn't say

00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:08,290
where that is the backup URL that's soul

00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:11,350
in the next big slide if you're using an

00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:13,000
external backup then you just say bakula

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:17,350
the one that you need of course and

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,150
that's it effect for that point real

00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:21,040
will say if you're using next door

00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,800
backup mechanism I don't care about your

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:28,030
backups I just care about making and the

00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:29,860
rescue image and that's it ok so if you

00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:35,760
losing an internal wall it will make a

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:35,760
full backup alright and how that is done

00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:44,989
that is true how first the output flow

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:47,480
back up is about the storing the

00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:50,509
archives output is about storing the

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,070
eyes or image for the rescue image it

00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,340
doesn't have to be in ISO image of

00:21:52,070 --> 00:22:00,350
course I so output can be to the eyes or

00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:03,080
USB pixie boots tape or the ramdisk just

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:07,659
Ram disk so you have two flows for the

00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:13,159
backups and for your RAM disk effect and

00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:16,700
for that for example for the internal

00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:21,379
backup solution through netif s you can

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:26,899
say output is 0 but still it can be

00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:29,299
stored fire NFS shift local that it's

00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:33,080
all part of the net FS or even in tape

00:22:29,299 --> 00:22:35,629
if you say USB output is USB and becca

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,700
pets netif s that means that your USB

00:22:35,629 --> 00:22:41,289
disk will be prepared as a bootable USB

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:45,279
disk and backup will be stored inside

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:48,230
the USB disk and you can have several

00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,359
unique system or Linux systems making

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:54,499
part of it so it's separated by

00:22:50,359 --> 00:23:00,259
directive structure how can you

00:22:54,499 --> 00:23:02,570
differentiate and FS safes etc that is

00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:06,830
through the backup URL that defines the

00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:10,009
location ok the location you can see it

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:14,059
there on the right side you say equals

00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:17,330
file means on the same system and FS

00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:20,899
means an NFS location you have six USB

00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:23,960
tape and I saw the latest one either

00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:26,119
that means that you will create one big

00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:28,879
eyes of file system including the

00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,309
archives backup arrives there are some

00:23:28,879 --> 00:23:35,149
custom still using that remember i wrote

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:37,249
initially 15 years ago makes it the Roma

00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:40,070
recovery which was the purpose making to

00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:42,649
complete backup and the bootable CD and

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,630
if you're using the last type it's the

00:23:42,649 --> 00:23:46,160
same

00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:50,990
taking that happens still kiss was like

00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,570
that if you want to use an external

00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:56,390
backup solution then it's the similar

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:59,270
philosophy happens you define your

00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:03,490
output output means where do you want

00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:08,810
your rescue image do your mother tongue

00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:11,870
and eyes limits USB network even a day

00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:14,120
and backup means everything will restore

00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,800
to file the backup server so you will do

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,890
not care or rear does not care about

00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:24,230
your backups anymore only about the

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:28,820
rescue limits the local configuration

00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:32,690
file is at least one to freeze fund that

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:35,020
you need to define its local gov or site

00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:40,100
but Gulf you have the choice effect and

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:43,190
by default output is already I so but if

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:46,130
you do not define an output URL it will

00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:50,900
be just thought on the system itself and

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:53,860
the dvar lip rear output therefore it's

00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:57,080
always handy to define at least two

00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:59,180
variables the backup which kind of

00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,700
backup do you want an internal one or an

00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,860
external one let the fest is internal

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,890
then you have to define a backup URL and

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:11,600
unreal remote location and let's be very

00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:13,850
important and the part is that first

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,550
after two slices is a servant and apart

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:18,590
and on the lfs server is always stored

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:21,860
under the part that you defined and then

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,600
it will create automatically and sub

00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,630
directly with the host name of your

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,000
Linux client so that means if you do

00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:32,030
hundreds of these servers and live the

00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,800
same URL definition still there is a

00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,800
differentiation with the host name

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:42,179
it's always handy if you starting Lee

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,190
freer to do a real dump because then it

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:46,770
will tell you which kind of system you

00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:48,390
have and what does it find off your

00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:50,640
system does it find configuration files

00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:56,400
it will tell you the architecture

00:25:50,640 --> 00:26:01,789
diversion and the real has some help

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:04,710
functionality embedded about the options

00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:08,190
very handy option is debugging if you

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,740
want to detect something the simulation

00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:12,870
I will tell you a little bit more about

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,809
the term a few moments later step by

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:19,200
step that means that each function our

00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:21,450
script will be asked to start so if you

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,539
want to debug something but it's only

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:30,559
for experts and ever both and a capital

00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:34,080
V is the version then the word flows

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,270
most of the times you are using or make

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,159
rescue that only creates the rescue

00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,620
image if you have an external backup

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,299
then there is no need to do random make

00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:44,159
backup because they make backup for an

00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:47,250
external backup is the same as make

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:49,140
rescue if you're using internal one then

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,899
you make backup is the one that you're

00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:55,380
using for making rescue image including

00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:57,750
the backup archives then you have some

00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:01,409
others check layout that's the function

00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:03,600
that is added in the crown to notice if

00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:07,470
something has been changed on the this

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,330
layout do files this has BN new version

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,480
of your current for example stuff like

00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:16,110
that and to recover it's just real

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:19,440
recover and all the rest is effect some

00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:22,110
help the format is to format your USB

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:25,039
disk that's normally in the next entry

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:29,250
or extent for or something else but not

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:32,610
not Vivette that's not allowed in

00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:36,929
practice I already message it more or

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:39,990
less so partitioning file system boot

00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:42,720
loader and make a system back up front

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,809
door or whatever make it bootable your

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,520
rescue image and it's done normally

00:27:45,809 --> 00:27:54,160
quite fast make rescue

00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:57,610
VAR block rear that it is the ISO image

00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,620
stored by default if the output URL is

00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:03,790
mentioned then it will also make a copy

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,940
to the output URL it's the NFS part for

00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:08,920
example the disk layout contains the

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,000
information about your system about the

00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:18,040
disks sizes the desk layout the file

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,560
systems etc etc and if you boot from the

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,650
risk limits you can see if it recognized

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,390
all your device drivers network drivers

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:28,110
very important if you want to restore

00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:30,730
from over the network and also different

00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:35,050
drivers for your disks if you do

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,640
clothing make sure if you're using not

00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,770
the same hardware that at least the

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,710
hardware that you drive that you need

00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:44,170
are also included in the risk limits

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:46,960
otherwise it will not be able to

00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:49,630
recognize to use it and therefore you

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,380
can add in modules for example extra

00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:55,270
models because everything in rear is

00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:58,030
effective a script if the configuration

00:28:55,270 --> 00:29:01,780
files are a bad script so you can define

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:06,640
it as an airy and you extend new drivers

00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:08,380
if they are required backup is as easy

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,620
as make rescue but it takes a bit longer

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:14,500
to make a backup of course recovery and

00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,500
details you boot from the rescue image

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,780
and then is just a real recover and it

00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,660
will recreate your disk layout file

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,780
systems configure it mounted restore the

00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:28,030
data make the bootloader active again

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:30,400
and then you can just done it stops

00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:32,380
you're still in initial ram disk you can

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,560
just inspect your system you can change

00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:38,800
you can look at the fstab file maybe not

00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,710
all unique ids are modified normally

00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:44,320
real does it best to modify new in

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:47,140
unique IDs but sometimes it's always

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,039
handy tool to check most critical stuff

00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:52,119
if it's

00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:53,499
looking fine and that's it then you

00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:58,330
rebuilt and you should you have your

00:29:53,499 --> 00:30:01,059
system back that's the how it looks to

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:04,450
when you do a real recover you have some

00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:06,909
options if you restore your system I'll

00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:08,710
you reboot maybe it comes back but if

00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:11,259
you don't touch any key it will

00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,109
automatically move from the first disk

00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,970
so if you forgot your eyes or image in

00:30:14,109 --> 00:30:18,039
your system it will by default try to

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,919
reboot from your first disk otherwise

00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:26,139
you have to select recover there's also

00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:30,460
functionality automatically recover okay

00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:33,309
some words about the simulation if you

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,249
want to start yourself if you use an

00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:38,349
option minus s it will show you all the

00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,629
scripts it will execute that it will not

00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:43,330
execute anything that will tell you all

00:30:40,629 --> 00:30:45,849
