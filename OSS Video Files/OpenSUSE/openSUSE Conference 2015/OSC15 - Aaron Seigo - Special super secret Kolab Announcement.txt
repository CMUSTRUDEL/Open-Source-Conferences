	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
the end of today is actually the

00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,569
official under the cold out of the

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,700
summit it's the third day of the open

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:10,349
session summit or a conference which has

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,960
I really enjoyed both how have you folks

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:22,830
been enjoying it so far good so you're

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,910
saying it was like okay brilliant that's

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,189
good there's still people milling around

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,180
the back you just come take seats please

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,180
you're making me nervous

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:48,089
brilliant excellent so we wanted to end

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:50,879
the event on not just a high note but an

00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:54,360
exciting note and so we've been working

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,739
on something within the colab realm and

00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,479
specifically actually the roundcube

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,250
realm for a while now and it's been

00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,350
really hard to keep this under our hats

00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:07,710
because it's we're really excited about

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,720
it and but we thought no you know what

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,550
let's save it for the summit and let's

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,340
share it with the world then so we do it

00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,340
in person and that hit the video

00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,840
so you won't have to go there although i

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,100
do encourage you to do that because

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,140
we're going to tell you all about what

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,819
this is so what we're announcing is a

00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,700
pair of things number one we are

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:17,190
embarking upon a significant and major

00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:19,680
refactoring of roundcube which is the

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,170
world's number one web mail application

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,840
free software web application in terms

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,600
of usage and adoption we actually have

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,610
with us we're very blessed to have the

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,019
guy who started this whole thing and as

00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,610
continue to work on it for the last 10

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:34,610
years Thomas brutally

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,170
and he's going to be walking us through

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:45,970
why we're doing this basically he's

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,450
gonna catch us a lot by who here uses

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,760
round q look at that you got fans in the

00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,440
audience classic right so he's gonna be

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,050
telling us about roundcube where it came

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,930
from where it is now and why we're doing

00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,910
this at the moment but we're not just

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,070
saying hey we're you know embarking on a

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,450
big refactor of this you know quite

00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,000
important free software application

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,920
we're also today in fact if you go to

00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,600
indiegogo com right now or if you go to

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,240
the URL that was up there you'll find

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,160
there is a crowdfunding campaign to make

00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,590
this happen to make this real we're

00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,180
looking to broaden the community around

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:22,450
roundcube and we want to get you guys

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,890
involved in what will be roundcube next

00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:25,390
so with that I'm going to hand it over

00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,740
to Thomas for a bit we'll come back at

00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,140
the end after him to talk a bit more

00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,440
about the crowdfunding campaign but for

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,940
now Thomas tell us all about rank you

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,450
thanks very much Aaron for this

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:39,610
introduction the title of this session

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:42,670
on the program was just one more thing I

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:47,320
always wanted to be on a stage and say

00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:49,540
these words front of an audience so has

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,140
already been told we're looking at the

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:55,840
ramp you webmail I'd like to walk the

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,020
timeline a little bit with you looking

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,930
at the past at the present where we are

00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:06,760
right now and where we want to go next

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:11,590
first of all let me introduce myself

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:15,070
again i'm thomas i'm the founder of rum

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,850
tube webmail and still in the position

00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:21,160
of the head developer i'm also wearing

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:24,880
the Hat of the administrator the

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:28,210
Secretary to release manager and all

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,910
these positions but I would also like to

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,700
mention another very important person on

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:37,510
the project which is Alec unfortunately

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:41,590
he's already on his way back he's the

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:44,470
top comedy meanwhile in no project and

00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,780
he's the guy who's actually get things

00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,090
done so

00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,490
we wouldn't be here today without Alec

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:54,510
of course and with all the other

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:59,250
community members but let's start at the

00:04:54,510 --> 00:05:01,740
beginning it was in 2005 when I was

00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:04,580
assigned with the task to evaluate a

00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:07,470
webmail option for my employer back then

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,290
preferably should be an open source

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:14,250
solution preferably in PHP because this

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:17,940
was our expertise and I was looking at

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:20,400
the usual suspects which were order and

00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,460
squirrelmail but I was rather

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,900
disappointed a little bit about how they

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,990
about the look and feel of these

00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,140
applications we were all using mainly

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:35,250
desktop applications for everyday email

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:39,240
so what I had in mind to port this

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,860
desktop look and feel into a web

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,590
application but none of the existing

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,330
solutions actually nearly showed an

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:49,650
approach to that so I first tried to

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:52,020
fiddle around with the source code of

00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,060
these projects try to extend them in a

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,940
way that I liked it to be but somehow

00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:01,350
failed at a very early stage so this got

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:04,590
me this left me with no other choice

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:07,440
than just giving it a try myself and try

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:12,120
to implement my vision of a web mail

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:16,080
application as I had it in mind and this

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,930
also seemed like a good good opportunity

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,600
for me to contribute back to the open

00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,490
source world I was using a lot of open

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,190
source software already but never

00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:29,130
actually participated or contributed

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,410
anything back so that's when I decided

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,860
when I had written my first lines of

00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:38,220
code to just publish it I then we just

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:41,400
did a project on sourceforge this was in

00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:45,570
may 2005 who almost celebrating a

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:49,289
birthday right now and yeah committed my

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,210
coat really is the tour ball with the

00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:54,030
version Oh point one alpha

00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:59,669
and just put it out there without any

00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:02,250
further expectations so yeah just to get

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:06,690
a little bit historic and this is what

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:10,259
it looked back then pretty ridiculous

00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:14,039
from today's point of view but still as

00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:17,190
you can see this was my vision of a more

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:20,669
desk up like interface there are no

00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:23,520
checkboxes for selecting messages you

00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:28,259
could use the mouse shift click type of

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:31,380
thing it already had this Ajax loading

00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:34,169
which could update the message list

00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,539
without actually reloading the page it

00:07:34,169 --> 00:07:40,020
has drag and drop to move messages from

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,870
one folder to the other so all pretty

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:46,409
new concepts ten years ago at least and

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,479
the web although there were not many

00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:52,440
features in there you could at least

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,949
compose messages and we even had order

00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:01,380
completion in there too as you type in

00:07:55,949 --> 00:08:04,229
the recipient field and yeah this these

00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:06,150
features apparently were appealing

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:11,270
enough for somebody to pick it up from

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:16,199
sourceforge and posted it on slashdot in

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:18,419
October and this this was really the

00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,400
kickoff for the entire project this way

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:25,710
this was where we gain public interest

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,719
this was also starting from there we got

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:30,240
more people on the project more

00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:32,579
contributions before that it was just me

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,050
alone we're working on it on my spare

00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:39,300
time without any expectations about it

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,399
so this was the first very exciting

00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,709
moment for me I didn't expect that at

00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:48,029
all I struggled a little bit in the

00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:53,709
first place how to handle this rush but

00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:59,600
it soon turned out to become quite a

00:08:53,709 --> 00:09:04,850
yeah fast-moving project another

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:07,910
milestone we had was in version 0 point

00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:10,639
3 where we decided to open it a little

00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:14,209
bit more up for others and added a

00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:18,980
plug-in infrastructure to the core so

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:23,119
that freed us from serving all the weird

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:27,319
feature requests and ideas that we have

00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:29,779
we received so we could direct these

00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:34,550
people to to the plug-in API and

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:37,910
encourage them to try to implement their

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:41,119
own their own stuff so looking back this

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,910
was this was a great choice a good

00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:48,829
physician it open it up for for any kind

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:51,769
of additional functionality one result

00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:56,119
is the whole call at web client as we

00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:57,889
know it today it's still using this

00:09:56,119 --> 00:10:00,110
plugin infrastructure to add all the

00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:03,160
group of functionality to roundcube ron

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:06,049
cube itself remains strictly remains a

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:09,379
email client with some address book but

00:10:06,049 --> 00:10:13,720
all the group weary stuff is still added

00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:17,299
on the basis of the plugins this again

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,389
boosted the project it gained us gave us

00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:24,379
more prominence it increased the use of

00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:27,110
the round cube in various places and it

00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:30,619
also marked the start of a a little

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:36,110
ecosystem around the product we see

00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:39,829
commercial providers for for plugins for

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:42,470
skins out there which is exciting and

00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:45,740
it's also I mean it just drives the

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:50,179
product and they try to be good citizens

00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:53,230
and contribute back and then along can

00:10:50,179 --> 00:10:57,920
call up at some point we had first talks

00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,929
with with the collar people in 2011 they

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,170
were looking for a replacement for their

00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:07,820
web client which was based on hoarder

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:10,880
and as a first proof concept we started

00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:14,810
implementing a calendar application this

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,600
is still what you today have in in the

00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,730
colored web client so we figured out

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,670
this can this can actually work we have

00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:24,920
the grind right background the right

00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,829
architecture to pill to build more group

00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:31,100
of functionality on top of that so more

00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:34,310
apps followed and all of these were

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:38,959
still strictly additions on the basis of

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:41,329
plugins the collaboration with the coop

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:44,720
project also brought many improvements

00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:47,930
to the core product itself we improved

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,769
the l-dub connection for for the address

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:54,649
book we added ACL controls for folder

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:58,910
sharing all these kind of nicely nice

00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:01,269
things they were also some security

00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:04,790
audits being done on round clip itself

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:08,990
which were initially initiated by by

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,610
call app and its customers so I would

00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,550
say we can we can name this a big

00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:18,230
success and it finally brought me here

00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:21,860
on this stage today and it was a really

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:25,459
perfect example how open source projects

00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,640
can can work together while yet

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:33,170
remaining independent we still have our

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:36,769
own roadmap of course we try to to align

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:40,339
with would call a band and listen to to

00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:46,550
them very carefully but still run cube

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:52,130
remains independent and this is this is

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:55,760
where we are right now so we're just

00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:59,510
with it is really get us we already said

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:04,130
we we can we find ourselves amongst the

00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:07,339
most popular when L options which are

00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:11,240
used out there we can look at a variety

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:14,079
of third-party editions in a Coggins

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:14,079
repository

00:13:14,119 --> 00:13:22,289
never leads to say that we are we can

00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:26,819
look at the perfect integration with

00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:30,839
wood with the call app stack and be part

00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:32,819
of this discrete project as well just as

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,669
a comparison to the screen just that we

00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:38,369
looked at before this is what the the

00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:40,259
very basic version of roundcube looks

00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:43,799
today in case you didn't see that

00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:46,919
anywhere yet and this is what it can

00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:51,119
look if you add more features if you add

00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:53,489
your custom skin and if you make use of

00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:59,099
all the goodies that are out there and

00:13:53,489 --> 00:14:03,059
put them together so question is are we

00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:07,169
done yet is this where we this where we

00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:10,459
want to be of course it is where we want

00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:13,079
to be but we're certainly not done yet

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:16,769
software project like these are actually

00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:22,739
never finished I don't need to mention

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:24,989
this actually we can look at a great

00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:30,329
evolution of the code base itself during

00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:34,289
the past 10 years we managed to to morph

00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:39,299
it into into what it is right now and it

00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:44,129
works great but still we've got to be

00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:47,249
careful to not make roundcube become the

00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:50,309
next we'll mail it reaches like lay back

00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:55,049
and enjoy ourselves where we are right

00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:58,619
now so yeah I guess we need to be honest

00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:03,419
here a little bit the basic architecture

00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:07,619
that is within one cube it's still

00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:11,309
almost ten years old the UI for example

00:15:07,619 --> 00:15:13,289
is no responsive unfortunately we also

00:15:11,309 --> 00:15:15,629
have seen that the feature development

00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:18,629
has slowed down a little bit because we

00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:22,319
somehow struggle how to put things into

00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:22,850
roundcube and we of course we also see

00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:26,500
other

00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:30,980
competitors rising which is a good thing

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:33,829
it keeps things going and this also

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:41,480
keeps us thinking about where we want to

00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:45,500
go so let's not let ramp you become the

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,110
next crew male and the good news is that

00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:52,399
we actually know what we need to do we

00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:55,790
know what needs to be changed these are

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:59,509
things that we definitely want to get

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:02,899
rid of we don't want any iframes anymore

00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:05,509
I guess times for services rendered 10

00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:08,839
planes are a little bit over we don't

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:11,959
want full page loads we don't want to a

00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,180
UI that is saying loading and fill data

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:19,399
is available again we don't want to

00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:21,440
mingle date around in the Dom so what

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,350
still these are the technologies that we

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:32,209
are that we're using right now so

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:35,750
there's got to be something next so the

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:40,839
the idea about this started with a blog

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:44,269
post I wrote last September where I just

00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:47,180
asked myself how would I approach this

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,850
project if I would just start right over

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,040
if I would start it today I'm not ten

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,459
years ago what are the technologies that

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:58,069
we have today how do you build a web

00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:00,290
application that will last for another

00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:04,490
10 years by using all the nice

00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:07,309
technologies that we have looking at

00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,650
what my ideas are today and compare them

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:12,799
with what we currently have in our

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:14,659
co-pays you quickly see that a

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:17,179
fundamental change in the correct

00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:19,549
architecture is necessary to actually

00:17:17,179 --> 00:17:23,929
make that happen and to priya's from

00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:28,490
from our legacy stuff so the idea is

00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:32,240
kind of obvious that you would could

00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:32,900
possibly just like really restart from

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,990
scratch

00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:38,210
we gained great experience and past 10

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,300
years but let's throw it all away and

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:44,030
start that over of course we're not

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:47,780
going to do that there are valuable

00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:51,470
things in there but still we want to

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:56,060
take this into something really new into

00:17:51,470 --> 00:18:00,590
what we call from cube next it's going

00:17:56,060 --> 00:18:02,900
to be a new exciting project we don't

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:06,110
only want to clean up our code base we

00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:11,510
really also want to rethink how email is

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:14,360
used today and try to involve these new

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:16,790
concepts of how people are using this

00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:20,240
for for their communication into this

00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:25,430
this new new product we have we have

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:28,520
great partners at hand who can cook and

00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:31,460
help us and of course we're also trying

00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:36,200
to invite more people into the project

00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:37,910
that's another fall of this endeavor so

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,900
to become a little bit more concrete

00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:43,820
about what we have in mind what we we

00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,930
want to go so we want to make it a

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,850
single web single page web application

00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:52,910
it's supposed to have a responsive UI

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:55,040
course we still want to keep it easy to

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,920
style as you can already do with the

00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,990
current roundcube and the skinning we

00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,580
want to keep it easy to extend the

00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:07,030
course want to keep all all the good

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:09,890
aspects from our current product and

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:13,580
that's something I want for myself we

00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:15,410
want to have it very easy to develop so

00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:19,790
in a proper architecture proper

00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:22,550
framework this also involves a nice

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:25,850
protocol to be used to communicate

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,850
between client and server and of course

00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:31,070
we wanted the whole open source this is

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:35,510
where we're coming from this is what

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:38,419
we're committed to and this is there's

00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:42,419
no doubt about this

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:46,380
so how do we get there I try to nail

00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:50,669
this down into the five easy easy steps

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,950
so first of all we're going to create a

00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:55,340
proper data model that we're going to

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,950
use on both sides client and the server

00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:03,539
which we then try to synchronize with a

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:07,200
adequate protocol J map comes comes to

00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:10,130
mind what it is then we're definitely

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,690
going to refactor our PHP code base

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,720
there is currently a lot of application

00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:20,130
logic in there and we want to clean this

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:22,769
up and turn it into a proper slick a

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:25,830
very thin layer on the server which

00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:27,179
basically just serves the protocol but

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,870
still there's a there's a lot of

00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:35,039
experience and nicely working stuff in

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,720
our PHP code base but the main the main

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,549
work is certainly going to be on the

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,139
client side where we first want to

00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:45,870
evaluate proper frameworks pick pick the

00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:49,980
right libraries from variety of things

00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,740
that we have available right now then go

00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:58,159
on implement that client with a solid

00:20:52,740 --> 00:21:03,600
base and finally put more apps on that

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:06,179
apps in the new sense can be what

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,720
whatever you interact certainly email

00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,519
will be a nap your address book and

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:19,409
whatever comes to mind for grouper as

00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:21,990
well so this is the plan and yeah to

00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:25,380
some this a little bit up it was a very

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:30,090
exciting journey so far we're very happy

00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:33,179
to be here we know where we are with all

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:36,269
the good things in mind and the legacy

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,179
that we're carrying around and we

00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:41,110
definitely know where we want to go so

00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:47,670
let's go there

00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:51,100
and that brings us to to you folks we

00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:54,429
have a strong partner at hand with call

00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:56,890
app and especially call up systems who

00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:59,049
is certainly capable of adding the

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:03,059
necessary resources to this project

00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:07,059
together with the entire environment

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:09,850
from soft project planning quality

00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:12,790
assurance and all the things that we

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,130
need to make this happen we have great

00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:18,610
partners for example from co-op digital

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,860
guys or doing an awesome job in the

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,679
graphic realm and they have they also

00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:26,380
have great ideas in mind about how this

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,140
could look like about how to improve the

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:32,980
usability and the user interaction part

00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:36,970
of this and but still to make this all

00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:40,960
happen we need some help from all of you

00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:44,260
and that's why we're introducing this

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,640
crowdfunding campaign which you can find

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:54,330
at this particular URL and where we have

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,330
Aaron to say a few more words about it

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,980
so thank you very much Thomas I was

00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,110
really cool walk down memory lane in 10

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:12,590
years of history in like 20 minutes or

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,820
something that's fantastic so if we just

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:16,090
see again did at the hands of all the

00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:18,170
roundcube users one more time yeah

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:23,240
there's more now did you guys just

00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:26,240
install it or so so we're going to look

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,200
really quick at the crowdfunding

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,170
campaign page you switch the phone I

00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,850
could find it somewhere it is cool so

00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,430
the video that we watched plus some

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,280
interviews explaining a bit of what

00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:44,210
Thomas has already gone through are up

00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:47,930
there already behind that beautiful card

00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,610
at the top and my face because I'm the

00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:51,530
one who does all the typing so for some

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:55,280
reason that gets you your face on there

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:59,180
so we explain what we're trying to do if

00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,920
you can go down to the image so we know

00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:03,440
that this is a big project all right

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:07,370
reinventing the entire web app that runs

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,170
colab is not small and we want to make

00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:11,360
sure that roundcube remains it has an

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,860
independence that Thomas has described

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,380
already and that you can still use it

00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,150
with your plane imap server for

00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:19,640
calendaring and email whatever it

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:22,160
supports natively so we're focusing

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,020
right now on the core which is all of

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,000
those things that Thomas described in

00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:27,710
his presentation that's our focus right

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,170
away so our first goal to hit 80

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:32,600
thousand in funding and what are we

00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,040
gonna do with that right so we want to

00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,390
make sure that Thomas is not sitting

00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,520
there with Alec and having to do it all

00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,800
himself so we're getting him a couple of

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,330
helpers we're looking to bring out at

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,840
least two other developers to work with

00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:46,910
him on this where you've got a UI

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,970
designer graphic designer to come in and

00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,560
do an amazing job of the UI so that it

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,990
looks gorgeous right from the beginning

00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:55,250
we're all used to what we you know ways

00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,750
accomplished after 10 years we don't

00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,060
want to take a step back you want to

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:02,450
look even better and we want to really

00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:05,900
raise the bar of what email on the web

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,340
is not just for free software but period

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,480
we want to make something that others

00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
are going to look up to and go yeah I

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,899
wish I have

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:15,500
so you can help us of course by going to

00:25:11,899 --> 00:25:18,919
our crowdfunding page it's on the ground

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:21,500
cube for / next or you just go to indy

00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:24,039
gogo directly and look for us we do have

00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:26,330
a bunch of really cool perks as well

00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:27,380
with our emphasis on community and since

00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,330
you're there already i'll talk about

00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,769
those ones first we actually have a

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,590
couple of really neat ones one is the

00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:36,679
backstage pass so for anybody who puts

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:40,700
in a $75 pledge you will actually get

00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:42,860
access to a forum discussion area where

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,960
we'll be forcing I mean allowing Thomas

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,759
to talk to people about what we're doing

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,679
but yeah we'll be updating everybody

00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,149
quite often there and it's a place where

00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:53,389
you can really stay up to like the

00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:56,539
day-to-day what's happening and giving

00:25:53,389 --> 00:25:58,250
us feedback as it happens and yeah so

00:25:56,539 --> 00:26:00,169
you'll become part of the team that

00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:05,299
directs it we also have a version of

00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:07,549
this for organizations we're setting up

00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:10,039
an advisory committee around roundcube

00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:12,370
and specifically for the refactor so

00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,419
there's a situation there for

00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,330
organizations who use roundcube we know

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:18,889
a lot of SPS ISPs large companies do so

00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:20,750
and so if they would like to get

00:26:18,889 --> 00:26:23,029
involved the only can they help fund it

00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:25,039
but they can also participate and close

00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:27,649
that loop and make sure that what we do

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,120
fit their needs right now in between

00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:32,179
that we also have a really cool one

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:36,740
which is the customizer perk and you'll

00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:38,480
get a customized skin just for you our

00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,600
digital designers are going to be

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,669
working on some really beautiful

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,500
next-gen looking stuff that they'll then

00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:48,289
customize you know with your name your

00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:51,440
logo pics and colors blah blah blah and

00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:53,899
these skins will be only for the purpose

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,299
of the of the crowdfunding so if you're

00:26:53,899 --> 00:26:57,919
a company or an individual who has a

00:26:56,299 --> 00:26:59,570
custom skin now with ground keeping like

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,279
it might be really cool to have a like

00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:03,259
an awesome skin for roundcube next when

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,529
i install it this is the one for you and

00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:09,500
of course we also have stuff at 10 25 50

00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:11,799
etc the usuals you can get stickers and

00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,389
t-shirts and all kinds of amazing things

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:16,460
so really encourage everyone to check it

00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:18,060
out but yes so I stand up here and

00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,980
babble about it

00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,210
what does that matter so much right so

00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,010
I'd like to ask a couple of people to

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,540
come up and give their opinion and their

00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:26,400
viewpoint on things and share a little

00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:32,310
bit more information with us so what we

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:34,170
start from their trip over the way up

00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:37,560
there so if those of you who have come

00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,660
and seen my talks on Cyrus I map and

00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,700
then J map obviously this is an area I

00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,680
really care about and I work for the

00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,980
company that has the best web interface

00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,320
for email on the Internet at the moment

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,090
obviously competitions good right it

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,680
drives all this better things we have

00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,120
open sourced a couple of things quite

00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,550
recently that I think will fit really

00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,500
well with this one of which is the

00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,260
overture JavaScript library that we

00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,350
built to power our webmail so the lowest

00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:07,020
level is already open sourced with the J

00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,220
mouth and Soros foundation the next

00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:11,070
level up from that which is the data

00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,110
model that drives our jmac client is

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,510
certainly going to be open sourced what

00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:18,300
we do about that we haven't yet decided

00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:19,560
we're working on how much we're going to

00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,440
give away because obviously that is

00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,000
separate and butter but definitely the

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,360
core stuff will be working a lot with

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,090
you on making sure that you know that

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,630
our stuff is available that's very

00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:34,890
exciting with you of course yeah so I'm

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,020
really excited about this end from the

00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:39,180
Soros foundation perspective we want to

00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,820
provide obviously a full open source

00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:47,870
stack and this looks like the right time

00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,870
our client for thank you thank you

00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:54,270
so I mean that's the beauty of free

00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,650
software right you can get people that

00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,390
are you know in the same space but

00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,950
competing a bit but we share stuff we

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:00,570
have common interests and we make it go

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,790
from the Cyrus site that's really

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:04,320
exciting I mean if you read between the

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,180
lines of what he actually said the Cyrus

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,790
Foundation which is a new foundation to

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,340
support Cyrus itself which is in itself

00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:14,130
as important news and they want to

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,600
deliver a full mail experience which

00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,520
would it mean that if you install Cyrus

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,590
there'll be a webmail client that you

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,900
can install with it that works

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,940
beautifully and this is what we're

00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,840
working towards with them Ron roundcube

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,980
next so yeah and if i could get york to

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,570
put you on the spot to come up in

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,770
because we're not showing your interview

00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:36,660
i thought i would show the video the

00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:38,880
interview but never here right here well

00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:44,460
i mean i'm not sure how much more I can

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:48,750
add other than this is for us one of the

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:53,010
most important projects for the next

00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:55,710
year's simply because we all know that

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:58,170
we drive the cloud of a fur software

00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,690
community in all is infrastructure right

00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,660
i mean we know the cloud runs on the

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:06,450
technology we built but people the

00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,850
humans interact with the application

00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,610
with the actual software that runs on

00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:14,790
top of it and the for the vast majority

00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:18,720
of people on this planet unfortunately

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:23,010
right now that means that that

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,880
application is proprietor and the data

00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:29,490
goes to a place that they cannot control

00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:32,640
now what we want to do and why this

00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:36,330
matters and why this matters to me is we

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:41,130
want to build a full free software

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:43,740
application that does the same thing but

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:46,050
better than free we want this

00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,840
application to be beautiful to be on all

00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:51,120
the devices to be everywhere something

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,490
that people use because they love to use

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,530
it

00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:56,140
like they love to use the internet today

00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:59,530
we want to create that application that

00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:02,770
they interact with and that is what we

00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:04,390
want you to do with us which is why

00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:17,290
we've launched this is why I think this

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:18,809
is important thank you so this is just

00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,429
really the we know it's the beginning

00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:23,050
only the campaign but at this rather big

00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:26,200
project I said we're meant we're

00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,520
focusing on the core first but when we

00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,500
hit that when you guys help us hit that

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,030
we got a lot of ideas of where we're

00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,309
going to go next we have a full roadmap

00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:34,540
in place and we'll be highlighting that

00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:36,640
over the next few weeks so you can

00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:39,070
really see what we have in mind and in

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,990
store and again to kind of read between

00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,880
the lines for Georg there when he's

00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,470
sitting on all the devices and you've

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,690
mentioned and you know something it's

00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,309
modern and fluid and that is part of our

00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,200
plan as well write something that lives

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:51,640
as comfortably on your tablet or

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,500
smartphone as it does on your on your

00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,650
laptop or desktop something that is

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:58,450
extensible and big so thank you both of

00:31:56,650 --> 00:32:00,040
you for coming up Thank You Thomas for

00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:04,540
10 years of amazing work i look forward

00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:06,190
another 10 years of it what and I thank

00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:07,840
you all of you in advance for helping us

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,020
get there and achieve these goals with

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,020
us

00:32:15,549 --> 00:33:24,460
I can promise the back in 2005 I was

00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:27,399
looking for a web mobile application

00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:30,419
that was had more the look and feel like

00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:33,609
a doctor desktop email application and

00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:36,909
looking at the free software options

00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:41,169
back then I found it rather

00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:43,480
disappointing and that's how I got

00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,840
started in roundcube I still remember

00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,029
when Thomas and I met in 2011 sitting in

00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,840
the Sun talking about how we could bring

00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:56,019
roundcube to call out we wanted to bring

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:59,049
this amazing and incredibly

00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:01,119
user-friendly interface to all the coal

00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:02,499
up users in the world and we're talking

00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,950
about how we could make that happen

00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,950
together

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:15,419
so I don't you evolve nicely in the past

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:20,800
10 years also the technology around that

00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:23,409
evolved dramatically and this brings us

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,440
now into a position where we figured out

00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:32,139
that the architecture where r cube is

00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:35,139
based on has a few downsides and which

00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:38,099
require a rather dramatic change in the

00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:42,669
fundamental way of application works and

00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:47,290
therefore it's about time to rethink it

00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:53,080
from the ground up and aim for a

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:55,540
completely new project where we can take

00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:59,080
the experience that are we gained in the

00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:02,040
past ten years along with the nice

00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:06,430
pieces of code that we have in Rome cube

00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:09,040
but with a fresh architecture hood with

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,750
a fresh concept that satisfies the

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,510
current technologies that we have at

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:16,089
hand and which is supposed to last

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,339
another 10 years or more over the past

00:35:16,089 --> 00:35:20,640
years Koloff has been investing heavily

00:35:18,339 --> 00:35:23,859
in tehran cube and we've done so gladly

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,320
because it is essential for humans that

00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:29,410
they have the tools that they need to

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,970
communicate and collaborate freely only

00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:34,869
free software can give you this and

00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:36,820
therefore we have contributed everything

00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:39,339
back to roundcube over the years and

00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,680
gladly done so just as Koloff is always

00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:44,320
released as per software so the primary

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,450
goal of this refactor is to take

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,210
advantage of these new technologies that

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:54,550
we have at hand today and to create a

00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:55,160
new fluid responsive web application

00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:58,070
that

00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:00,710
we'll give you a awesome news experience

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:03,340
of all kinds of devices that you use in

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:03,340
your everyday life

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,420
