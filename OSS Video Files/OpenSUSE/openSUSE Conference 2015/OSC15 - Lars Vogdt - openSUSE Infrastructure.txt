Title: OSC15 - Lars Vogdt - openSUSE Infrastructure
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	What services are running behind the opensuse.org domain? How are those managed and monitored? What needs to be done to start an own service under the *.opensuse.org umbrella? What is there already - and what is planned and needed in the future? Are there requests from community members and how are they handled? Who is making decisions - and when? What is running behind the openSUSE Build Service - and the well known Wiki and Wordpress instances? Who are those crazy guys that handle my requests?

hello everybody okay so welcome to my

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:12,450
talk about the opensuse infrastructure

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:15,450
today I want to tell you something about

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,750
the people behind the opensuse

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,300
infrastructure I guess most of you want

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,810
to know what we use as hardware

00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,539
resources and his services and so on and

00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:30,300
I hope at the end of my quick

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:35,340
walkthrough we still have some time left

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:38,760
for questions for hiring more people for

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,579
the open suse admin team and so on so

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,530
please close the door now so nobody can

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,670
get out before he is a written agreement

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,280
that he will work for us now okay but

00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,500
let's start I guess the first most

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,230
important part is always the people

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,800
behind all that stuff and that's why I

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,160
want to start with the people of Edmond

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,220
albums is org so what we have at first

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,420
or most interesting customer mr. back

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,150
but beside him we have a lot more so we

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,189
have on one side Thomas Schmidt who is

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,799
writing most of the time web

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,799
applications especially features

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,350
opensuse org is from him and some other

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:28,680
stuff mmm so he is our let's say fire

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,280
brigade in case something is broken then

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,659
we have on the provo side of life

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,930
because he is located in Provo Utah who

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,560
is eight Matthew illa whose web

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,549
administrator at novel but he always

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,490
helps out in our opensuse area and tries

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,649
to fix the Vicki's updates them to the

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,040
latest code version and here's a lot of

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:56,700
fun with WordPress and especially the

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,640
security box for WordPress then we have

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,729
I guess everyone knows here already this

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,899
name and this guy henna and a forged

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:11,730
sang we have the next guy you always

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:15,060
know it's cool Stefan cool or he's not

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,150
only more or less managing the releases

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,340
no he's also doing crazy admin stuffs

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,700
like shutting down the build service no

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:28,920
sorry he is repairing the build service

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:32,340
I'm the one who shuts it down so low

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,260
glocal positions I guess then we have

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,959
the one who is currently right in front

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:42,510
doing all the infrastructure staff here

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,010
in the room thank you home if you want

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,110
to know something about core

00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,680
administration stuff which is deep below

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:51,810
my knowledge no above my lunch he knows

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,129
all the stuff that I don't know I hope

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:58,170
you get it then we have the one who is

00:02:56,129 --> 00:03:01,859
clearly hiding a bit it's Christopher

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:05,099
Hoffman working most on the pearl areas

00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:07,680
in opensuse so hammers is one of his

00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,780
core topics if you ever get a

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,900
notification by hammers you can ping him

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,940
so then we have also that one you can

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,000
see him walking here around but normally

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:24,989
he don't want to get on a picture that's

00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,930
why I took that one the current size of

00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:31,230
his t-shirt is nearly the size that you

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,370
can expect behind him so his name is

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,200
derek's Marcos bucket if you are on

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:40,200
opens with a project in the erk channel

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,849
you probably sooner or later we'll see

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,930
him there hanging around answering

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:48,540
questions in all areas because you can

00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,880
also ask him whatever you want probably

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,220
he has at least someone who's close

00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:58,440
enough to answer your question in deep

00:03:53,220 --> 00:04:04,109
oh sorry and we have at least one new

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:08,459
guy this one here garage strata who

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:12,049
joined my team at zuzu Gerhard is

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:17,489
currently working on crazy puppet stuff

00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:22,500
so he has the crazy target to Papa Phi

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:24,110
anything so he's our puppet master the

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,650
other guy I guess you always

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:30,469
or see him working around here a lot

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,030
Jurgen vai got he is currently managing

00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:36,319
all the video stuff and all the stuff

00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:40,569
that is broken and he's working right

00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:43,759
now at own cloud and has some fun there

00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:45,139
the next guy is also here I guess he's

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,259
currently in the third room and doing

00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:53,349
video recording Martin chai normally

00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:56,659
located in Prague and we have Scott Viva

00:04:53,349 --> 00:05:00,050
located improve all doing also all those

00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:04,279
web administration of stuff that I not

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:07,159
even want to touch and yeah more or less

00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:11,120
that are the main people that I at least

00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:15,400
got some pictures from so overall we are

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,229
around 20 people most of them are just

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,500
responsible for one or two special

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:24,789
services that they developed and they

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,240
provide to us customers so for example

00:05:24,789 --> 00:05:31,550
ICC opensuse org who knows that nobody

00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,060
this is a web space where you can

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:36,770
download your monitor profiles your

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:40,069
color profiles for your monitors so you

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,680
have the same color on your monitor or

00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,229
than on your printer especially

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,870
interesting when you print out photos

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:50,389
also so that is a guy who is developing

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,110
the application behind that and he also

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:58,699
administers his server who knows active

00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,759
doc ah at least some more thank you for

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:05,360
the others active talk dot opensuse org

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:10,419
this is where opensuse starts to develop

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,089
his documentation it's a Drupal instance

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:16,219
enhanced with additional plugins and the

00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:19,870
guy who wrote the plugins is also the

00:06:16,219 --> 00:06:22,610
guy who needs to write the documentation

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,060
so if there's back he's the one who can

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,060
blame himself

00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:36,190
okay and the news guy tio joint more or

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:37,540
less today he will help jihad with all

00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:40,450
the puppet profiles and with the

00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,910
co-administration especially also inside

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:47,040
the web area of the stuff that is

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:50,470
located in Nuremberg and I probably

00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:52,900
forgot someone I'm sure but please

00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:56,140
that's my fault in my brain I just have

00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:01,060
too many names inside please forgive me

00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:04,120
if I didn't remember every name but we

00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,860
are a lot right next interesting

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,650
question what are you running behind

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:14,040
that stuff what's that one that is

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:14,040
providing opensuse ok here it is

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:40,310
I have sound but you don't know you

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:43,900
don't want to hear it so that's how it

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:50,450
sounds in the server room what you've

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:54,080
seen here and now also see here this is

00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:58,490
our arm cluster building packages for

00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:02,930
arm so as you can see there is still

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:06,590
room for improvement we can have more we

00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,510
just need someone to provide them on the

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:13,010
other side this is also some cluster

00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:16,810
that is building arm packages on x86 we

00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:20,510
have our geico and this here the whole

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:26,060
line of Rex is the opensuse build

00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:28,550
service there is currently not a single

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,850
device which is not building packages in

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,040
that line I guess so there's something

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:37,099
broken you will see us climbing there

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:40,400
around that maybe with a bit more light

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:44,270
but I found it more beautiful in the

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,830
dark and here is some kind of our

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:50,360
storage systems here also and if you

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,650
come close to the storage look like that

00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,200
one and next year if you are not back

00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:02,540
I'm happy to offer some server room

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,880
tours if you like but we won't then it's

00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:09,470
cold like here but so you are already

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:13,730
familiar with that ok so come to the

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:16,460
statistics we have at least two main

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,170
locations one is the number one is

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:24,380
improvable and since quite a couple of

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,600
years we have one machine standing

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,560
externally which is called are suing

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,360
opensuse org so if you load stuff from

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,810
that machine that's this single real

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,610
machine located at a sponsor

00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:42,580
and we have two virtual machines running

00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:45,430
in the Google Cloud area currently they

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,770
are just additional mirrors especially

00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:51,790
for those who run opensuse in the cloud

00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:57,010
in the Google cloud yeah for now back we

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:59,830
have 17 real machines so we reduce the

00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:04,870
amount of machines already we have less

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:09,010
real machines we have 96 real good

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:12,070
workers last year we had just half of

00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:16,720
them so guess where all those machines

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,980
here wind and all our desktop machines

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,490
and all the other stuff that we don't

00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:25,330
need to use we increase the amount of

00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:29,770
virtual machines running on the real

00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:33,510
machines and probably we will go in that

00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:36,880
direction during the next year's

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:40,480
switches villains Aereo consult service

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,940
kvm switches and yes we have different

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,530
storages so Zeus is currently sponsoring

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:50,350
all the xan stuff luckily since a year

00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:52,720
we have a reliable storage for most of

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:55,720
the service I guess you know that we

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,960
suddenly lost around 20 terabytes and

00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,930
need to find the backup for that that

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,610
was really funny last year but right now

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:05,890
everything runs on a more or less

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:07,960
reliable storage and i still wait for

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:11,350
someone who comes to me and asked me to

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:13,410
switch to the zoo storage solution let's

00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:17,530
see what happens in the next year's and

00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:21,550
in provo we have a cluster setup of

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:25,120
three machines for all those PHP stuff

00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:28,720
let's say in that way so forums wiki's

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:31,390
WordPress instances are running in provo

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,510
and they also have a database cast

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,480
including storage but this cluster is

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,400
shared between multiple setups so I

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,100
cannot really tell you how much hardware

00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,600
it is in deep enough a number gets easy

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,730
for me because I can go down in the

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,010
server room and count them for provo I'm

00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:49,540
just once a year or so that normally

00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:51,150
they don't let me in because they know

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:54,730
my name

00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:57,250
okay just for your information next year

00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:59,440
please remember that picture when you

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:05,080
are in newburgh that's the headquarter

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,120
of susan and somewhere there i will show

00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:11,970
you next year is the server room where

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:16,000
you can find all that stuff yeah

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,350
questions normally I get a lot of deep

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,390
interesting questions about fibre

00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:21,390
channel and fcoe in that stuff yeah

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,330
okay the question is mm-hmm the question

00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,010
is why we are using improve Allaster of

00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,750
machines for providing all that stuff

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,690
instead of having one or two machines

00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:53,190
that run virtual machines on them also

00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:57,790
right yeah yeah I will answer that later

00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:59,920
okay so I keep the question in mind I

00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:05,710
hopefully can answer that with one of

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,530
the last slides okay other questions No

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:13,870
okay next one which services are you

00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:16,600
providing to us okay let's start with

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:21,280
the highlights I guess everyone knows

00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:26,290
that one i guess nobody knows because it

00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:29,680
works most of the time okay thank you

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:30,910
most other time sorry for the other time

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,150
i'm the one who's sitting on the network

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,150
cable

00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:42,420
yeah so we have 190 mirrors around the

00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:45,269
world but our users just no one download

00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,429
source download open zoo org and behind

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:50,009
the scenes there is a redirector working

00:13:47,429 --> 00:13:52,379
scanning all those mirrors continuously

00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:55,649
to see if they have the up-to-date files

00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:58,769
and so on and only redirecting the users

00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:01,379
requesting files to the closest mirror

00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:04,170
nearby them and the mirror that has the

00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:06,689
correct file so normally it's completely

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,660
transparent to our users but something

00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:11,429
that makes opensuse mall is unique for

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,619
all other distributions they need to

00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:16,410
enter the local nervous and hope that

00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:19,199
they provide the correct files and don't

00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,869
lose any updates we do it the other way

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,290
around I have a separate take talk for

00:14:21,869 --> 00:14:28,049
that so if you want to join it okay

00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:33,470
opensuse build service nothing more to

00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:36,660
say than statistics 280,000 packages

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,369
guys you're making crazy especially if

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:43,319
it comes to the hardware Bechet but okay

00:14:40,369 --> 00:14:45,269
and we have a virtualization platform in

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:47,939
the beginning we called it Alice in

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:52,470
Wonderland because we could not imagine

00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:55,559
how it works that's a very very

00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,889
simplified set up so we have the virtual

00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:02,490
machines connected via private land

00:14:57,889 --> 00:15:05,910
inside and then we have virtual machines

00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:10,730
as cluster providing for example in age

00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:10,730
a proxy to the outside into the internet

00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:18,240
that's simple right but for me it's

00:15:15,119 --> 00:15:21,740
complex ok and then we have quite a lot

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,600
of other stuff I guess just to name them

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,589
so you don't forget them if I miss

00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,589
something just tell me

00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:39,240
yes for example maxilla is also on that

00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:41,460
list for example somewhere so yeah it's

00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,850
quite a lot of stuff quite a lot of

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:50,040
services and to be honest even if we are

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:51,780
20 people just remember we had over 100

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,030
machines and all of them are working

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:58,950
continuously and none of them breaks any

00:15:54,030 --> 00:16:01,050
time none everything works and most of

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,030
our service engineers who can help us

00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:08,370
with our services are located all over

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:11,250
the world okay so I guess you get the

00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:18,590
point yeah we allow stuffed but we have

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:20,730
a lot of fun questions about that good

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:25,320
operating systems what do you guess huh

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:36,840
come on huh huh it can only be open to

00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:41,000
the right can only be open Susan okay we

00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:44,040
runnings less on most of the systems and

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:50,720
we have around four hundred additional

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:50,720
packages building especially force less

00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:58,900
no we have the enterprise build service

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,390
yes and most of those 400 packages are

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,780
available in the opensuse build service

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:12,170
I have just the simple policy for all my

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,510
guys running the services I say no he

00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:16,250
will not go there unpack a tarball and

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,660
do though your stuff or do a git

00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:24,280
checkout no no sorry that's not how I'm

00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:27,880
working so if you want to have a service

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:31,040
it's possible it's easy just ask me yeah

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,520
but you need to provide an RPM and you

00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,250
need to maintain that RPM we are here to

00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:40,610
help you building that RPM maintain that

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,160
RP and that's not a problem but with

00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:46,550
providing rpms it's much easier for us

00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:49,130
to maintain all that stuff and with

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:53,870
providing an RPM it's much easier to

00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:58,930
find others who use your stuff and join

00:17:53,870 --> 00:18:01,610
the team so yes it's a bit of

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:09,040
self-education so yes we have a good

00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:11,330
guys so after that as the talk is short

00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:17,000
what do you plan for the future what do

00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:19,580
you think we open everything up so the

00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,060
so room 2 will be open from seven to

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:22,060
twelve now

00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:32,620
yes

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:40,010
Yeah right so getting more community

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,820
members inside the team that's not a

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:47,660
challenge we have admin open Zuzu org as

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:50,360
mailing address we have admin opensuse

00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:53,720
as a channel we have the opensuse

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,030
conference and we have personal mailing

00:18:53,720 --> 00:19:00,710
lists we have stuff so if you want to

00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:03,580
join the team no way to hide so just

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:08,270
choose wherever you like to contact us

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:11,270
the problem is to find the people that

00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:18,770
want to join us but you are working on

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:21,580
that right yeah you can learn a lot

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,500
during administering such a service and

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:27,710
we're working towards making it easier

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,810
for those who want to join this is on

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:36,970
our agenda so the first topic more

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:42,440
automated IT infrastructure minute mend

00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:44,840
it's blah blah right blah blah nobody

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,890
can imagine what is behind that so

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,679
what's currently

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:52,960
yeah that's true but what's behind that

00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:56,460
is that we have Mickey and Minnie right

00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:00,010
now as Mickey and Minnie opensuse ork

00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:02,710
running a get lab get lab is something

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:06,460
like you tap but open so you can watch

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:09,070
it and get out until currently pushing

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:13,510
their puppet information the puppet

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:16,179
configurations into that one so as its

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,490
open as it's publicly available people

00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:20,440
can join see what how we configure the

00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,340
services how we configure the servers

00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:28,600
and come up with those neatly snaky guys

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,340
like pushing and merging stuff so that

00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:32,890
is something that our developers at

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:38,770
least love to see and we said okay we

00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:42,820
are DevOps try the same right so even if

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:45,539
this one is just one line it's very

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,480
important for us for more openness

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:52,090
because then we can easily say ok guys

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:56,169
this is the configuration now send us a

00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:59,590
patch that includes you ssh key and once

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:04,059
you deploy that you'll be on our servers

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:05,289
right and for us it's easy because then

00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:11,289
you have proven that you can work at

00:21:05,289 --> 00:21:13,390
least with get and puppet ok next one

00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:16,419
public infrastructure state is something

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:18,510
that people ask me to provide so this is

00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:21,039
currently the plan how it will look like

00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:23,409
so you will see the open Zeus build

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,080
services mostly ok we have a problem

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,330
with one of the helper services for us

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,210
as administrators it will be interesting

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:34,659
to know which of those help our services

00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:38,230
is down but for us users don't care just

00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:39,880
just look at the big picture yeah in the

00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:43,750
original planning we thought about

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:47,890
providing negros or king of front and

00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:51,460
read only to all our users but that's

00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,890
much because then you see ha how much

00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,960
CPU load do you have on the build server

00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,970
and

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,660
better ring us twice because the cpu

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:04,000
load is a 10 already since an hour which

00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,820
is normal for the bid service but you

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,250
don't know so don't be surprised that it

00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,450
will be a reduced view if you are

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:14,500
interested in getting more information

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:17,380
we are happy to provide that another one

00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:21,400
that people ask us our download

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:27,190
statistics well I was at a workshop

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:29,200
logstash now i catched i need to provide

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,670
something with log stash cabana and all

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,500
that stuff I don't know how it works but

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:35,950
I will provide it somehow during the

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:39,190
year so I cannot prove that it will look

00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:41,890
like that in the end but hopefully all

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:43,960
developers can see how much downloads

00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:47,520
their package see over the time from

00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:51,510
Donald opensuse org we have additional

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,970
information that is collected via pivot

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:56,980
but I guess that is just something for

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,440
the board to see which web pages are

00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,530
more interesting than others but most

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,220
users ask here oh I have a package in

00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:07,840
ops how much people are using it so I

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,800
guess this is something that is wanted

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,420
and hopefully we can provide it next

00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,570
point something that makes our life

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:19,000
easier hopefully I told you already 190

00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:21,880
mirrors oh I need to do maintenance on

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,520
my mirror oh I cannot have all the full

00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:27,550
trees anymore or please can you just

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:30,610
scheduling me down so I get not over my

00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:33,280
bandwidth limits all the time those are

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,230
the normal requests that we get and with

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,630
mirror pinky because we have mirror

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:40,270
brain is download redirector now we have

00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:43,990
mirror pinky that will be a simple web

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:46,000
front-end for our mirror app mins to do

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,140
that stuff on their own so we can get

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,090
rid of all those additional

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,880
administration tasks that we normally do

00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:56,200
so they can add a new mirror remove them

00:23:51,880 --> 00:24:01,150
blah yeah let the people do what they

00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:02,490
want to do and I have your question in

00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,980
mind

00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:08,350
currently the plan is to have at least

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,900
small virtualization cluster setup in

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:15,370
provo in the data center which is

00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:17,260
dedicated for opensuse dedicated to run

00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:22,210
all that stuff that is currently under

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:24,210
the opensuse umbrella I hopefully get

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,690
the information if I have the budget to

00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:31,390
buy a new hardware for that i already

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:35,380
have people who will help me to set it

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:39,880
up hmmm i have no people to administrate

00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:43,270
those things so if you want to get lazy

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:48,640
like it opensuse admin it might be the

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:56,230
right time to join okay does it answer

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:58,570
your question most of the time those

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,520
services that are let's say a

00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,760
multi-homed so we will probably have an

00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,800
additional download server mirror /

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,430
improve all because we have not so much

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:12,220
mirrors in the u.s. right now the server

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:14,950
that is delivering static content CSS

00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:17,200
files JavaScript and so on simple web

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:20,200
server will go over there and additional

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,800
services the funny part is that we are

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:26,200
using / or opensuse s based system and

00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,170
we have virtual machines that can be

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,470
migrated life online or between all

00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:37,900
those locations wouldn't that be a funny

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:40,210
funny thing to do no ww opensuse org is

00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:48,010
improvable oh I want to have it in

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:50,500
Beijing now I love to see that and maybe

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:55,240
we will have even but that's not on the

00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:58,150
agenda but times change maybe we will

00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,820
have even a web and an email service to

00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:02,410
provide so post fix admin might be an

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:06,280
interesting change for us in the future

00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:09,000
and let's see what happens we are open

00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,000
for everything

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,630
additional questions yes

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:40,540
No

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,900
okay just want to see if i can open

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:03,700
progress so the other people hopefully

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:06,530
know what it is at least now you know it

00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,900
progress is our management tool our

00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:13,790
let's say ticket system and project

00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:17,770
management tool and if you click on

00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:22,640
opensuse admin you will see no ticket oh

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:24,500
I'm locked in already no no okay so if

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,330
you write an email for example to admin

00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,910
opensuse orchid will end up here as a

00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:32,330
ticket so everyone inside the admin team

00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:35,120
can grab it up and take it for him and

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:40,070
work on that oh I suggest the public

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:42,770
ticket that's why so as you can see we

00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:46,910
have very very interesting reports from

00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:49,070
our users already and some of them are

00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:52,550
assigned to other people some are not

00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:56,450
but to be honest it's a free and open

00:27:52,550 --> 00:28:00,010
project so I cannot aggressively push on

00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:00,010
the people to solve the problems

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:21,970
yeah I will tell you I will tell you

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:24,100
some secret in the beginning we decided

00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:28,090
okay every email that comes in should be

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,669
public but after the third email about I

00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:35,559
forgot my password normally it should be

00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:39,820
able do you think twice if you make it

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:42,130
public right or if someone says oh this

00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,679
ugly guy named Lulu on the mailing list

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,679
he's shouting on me all the time you

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:49,179
don't want to make it public so from

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,360
time to time when I walk through our

00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:54,340
survey that's a public ticket done but

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,309
most of the time the initial setup is

00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:59,620
make the ticket private only visible for

00:28:57,309 --> 00:29:03,100
administrators for that reason because

00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:07,120
people really send passwords plain text

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:11,610
in the emails and other stuff and yeah

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,610
it's it's just a little bit secret but

00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:21,320
do you change the hospital

00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,070
I

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:34,390
so this is the new section on that thing

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,890
this is connected to Planet opensuse org

00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:39,470
so whenever we have something to tell

00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,780
normally it should also end up on Planet

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:45,770
at least I hope if not please ask that

00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,180
means so here is where we provide some

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,360
information normally about

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,400
infrastructure changes and so on so

00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,680
people can can watch and read what's

00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,870
going on there and for the wiki to be

00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:00,080
honest I normally say it's en opensuse

00:29:56,870 --> 00:30:02,150
org and then you can find some stuff so

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,590
here's just the placeholder more or less

00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:12,620
I guess that's understandable yeah but

00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:19,180
that's progress opensuse org other

00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:19,180
questions yeah sunny

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
Oh

00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:30,479
no no no no you can always send an email

00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:32,969
to admin door opens ooh org it will

00:30:30,479 --> 00:30:37,679
always go through even for all the spam

00:30:32,969 --> 00:30:39,769
that you want to send to us okay other

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,769
questions

00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:47,679
you can also if you are logged in you

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,679
can open a ticket yes of course

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,920
as soon as I find time

00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,890
doesn't really make you happy right of

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:05,660
course you can help me if you like then

00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:07,940
maybe it's getting faster to the step

00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:10,190
where it working just provide me some

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,920
RPM package fists from elasticsearch

00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:20,030
logstash and all the dependencies and

00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:22,310
then we can go and install it I know

00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:27,460
they asking me normally so it's good to

00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:32,090
know they are asking you also yeah yeah

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:33,820
yeah yeah yeah we had just for

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,710
information we had that information

00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:39,920
formerly directly in the opens was a

00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:44,090
build service there was a student

00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:48,140
writing that stuff but neither the

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:51,040
student nor we were expecting such a

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:54,560
success from the oldest build service

00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,200
because the code that he was written was

00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:03,800
based on the assumption that let's let's

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:05,900
assume 1000 users or so we turn it off

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:12,470
right now because otherwise the API is

00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:14,810
unusable is it it's like open source

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,280
project start normally you have a small

00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:18,380
problem you fix it on your own and

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,620
others find it useful jump on the train

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:28,480
and a year after you say hot this

00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:28,480
cat can't be so yeah Sonny

00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,660
what's the oldest sorry I

00:32:51,510 --> 00:33:07,870
okay okay my question is what kind kind

00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:12,070
of guy you are looking for and what

00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:13,840
skill they should have I'm looking for a

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:18,990
guy who is able to work on a computer

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:22,480
and a guy who is reliable that's it

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:24,580
really because everything that we do as

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,420
administrators normally in our daily

00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:32,770
basis can be learned what you cannot

00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:34,840
learn are your social skills so the only

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,030
thing I'm normally watching up is a guy

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,640
with the right social skills because

00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,260
everything else you can learn and we are

00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,610
administrators normally we help each

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:47,890
other so he will not get maybe it's a

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:51,580
good idea maybe we can give him the task

00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:54,940
fix the build service next time but

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,070
normally what happens is that we run

00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,940
into a problem and we say a can you take

00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:02,650
over that and if you say yes let him do

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:04,810
join him if you have questions we can

00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:07,480
answer that and we can give even such

00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:10,600
great tools on Linux like screen and

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:13,450
other sharing tools like like mumble and

00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,240
and so on or our chats where you can

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:19,660
just join walk together talk together

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:22,330
and fix the problem together and that's

00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,700
a big benefit for both because one

00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,980
learns something new in the technical

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:30,400
area and the other guy learns to mentor

00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:34,690
or something so yes you don't need to

00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:37,090
have big technical skills but we have to

00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:39,030
rely on you that you really want to join

00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:41,350
that you really want to work with us and

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:48,510
to be honest from time to time it's good

00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:48,510
to ping us again that's all yeah okay

00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:58,840
slightly over time but we make the last

00:34:51,370 --> 00:35:00,750
question three two one okay if you have

00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,650
other questions please ask me on the

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:08,520
event outside in the Sun okay thank you

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:08,520
