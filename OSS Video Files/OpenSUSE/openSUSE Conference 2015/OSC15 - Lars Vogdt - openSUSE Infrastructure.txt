Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	What services are running behind the opensuse.org domain? How are those managed and monitored? What needs to be done to start an own service under the *.opensuse.org umbrella? What is there already - and what is planned and needed in the future? Are there requests from community members and how are they handled? Who is making decisions - and when? What is running behind the openSUSE Build Service - and the well known Wiki and Wordpress instances? Who are those crazy guys that handle my requests?
