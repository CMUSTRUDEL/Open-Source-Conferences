Title: OSC15 - Keynote by Aaron Seigo
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	He will talk about open source community management and how they are able to work together. Further information will follow soon but since OSEM requires me to add at least 80 words into this field I feel compelled to at least reach that minimum in order to be able to submit this proposal, this limit (however logical) is very annoying if you want to quickly register talks and definitely should be reconsidered to be set to a lower minimum.
