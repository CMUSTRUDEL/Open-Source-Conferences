Title: OSC15 - Keynote by Aaron Seigo
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	He will talk about open source community management and how they are able to work together. Further information will follow soon but since OSEM requires me to add at least 80 words into this field I feel compelled to at least reach that minimum in order to be able to submit this proposal, this limit (however logical) is very annoying if you want to quickly register talks and definitely should be reconsidered to be set to a lower minimum.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,130
how was a lunch for everybody good ah

00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:07,350
there's noises out there that means

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,420
you're not sleeping yet brilliant it's

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,610
always the the trick with being put it

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,630
right after lunch it's the day when you

00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,089
know the time when everyone falls asleep

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:19,740
so hopefully we'll keep you awake with

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:22,890
excitement sounds magic so when I was

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,720
asked to do a presentation on said well

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,039
what do you wanna talk about I was a

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,640
really good question because i use

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:32,820
opensuse have for years but i don't

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,020
contribute to it and quite appreciate

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,390
that you folks i'll make it and i

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,980
thought well what can I talk about and

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:39,120
since it was the the first day and I

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,469
want to keep you guys awake and

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,629
entertained I thought I wouldn't talk

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,180
about anything too technical but rather

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,489
talk about the reason why we're all here

00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:49,410
right which is free software so if I was

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:51,989
to ask you and please shut out some

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,449
ideas or some answers if I was to ask

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,460
you what is the best feature of opensuse

00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,489
in your mind or like one of the best

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:07,619
features what would it be not all at

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:09,090
once diversity sorry yes cool upstream

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:10,890
people all right these are all good

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:13,920
answers right I don't think that's the

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,330
best feature though and I'd like us to

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,080
think about what is the best feature

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,040
free software and the reason why I

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,530
wanted to talk about this questions

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,930
because when we hear about free software

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,799
today whether it's in the media or

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,570
talking about it with each other online

00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:33,509
free software and particularly the

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,430
poster child of Linux it has become like

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:40,200
a superhero of technology right it is

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:43,049
well yeah world freaking domination

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,720
right that used to be a joke and it kind

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,579
of has happened somehow linux is number

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,619
one in so many fields I mean

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,880
supercomputing that's been a while but I

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:56,640
mean we own that space mobile computing

00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,390
how many people here have a Apple device

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,170
like an iOS device right how many people

00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,149
here have an Android or some other yeah

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,590
that's called domination right there and

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:08,759
you guys are typical this is what the

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,289
world looks like maybe not quite that

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,489
star especially not if you're in likes a

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,800
new york or it's a bit different but

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,560
most the world that is it

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,940
has owned that space what runs in your

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,940
pocket is free software that's pretty

00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,780
amazing cloud computing I've heard a lot

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,490
of people talking about cloud computing

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:27,240
in fact you're just mentioning it

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,860
outside this a bit earlier when you

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,320
think of cloud computing unless you're

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:35,070
you know with Microsoft and think Asher

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:37,320
is an awesome name for it cloud is about

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,480
is about free software even if you don't

00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,770
run a free operating system in the cloud

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,400
you're probably running some free

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,900
software on that image so and without

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,100
without free software i don't think the

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,690
cloud would have happened in the way it

00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,920
has I by the way I hate that term cloud

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,720
but I'll use it anyways because all the

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,420
cool kids do free software has also

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,310
become number one in a lot of individual

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,390
application categories i won't bore you

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,870
all with listing them it's also

00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:09,120
considered now a leader in innovation we

00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,890
talk about configuration management when

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,680
we talk about things like cloud my talk

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:16,170
about replicated tribute a key value

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,910
stores all the cool things right we talk

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,370
about languages that you're going to

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,380
deploy web apps in right this is all

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,110
free software now this is where the

00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:27,300
innovation is happening I remember back

00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,280
not I won't say how many years but some

00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,690
years ago and we were always like her a

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,570
speedo free software doesn't innovate

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,739
right the proprietary companies would

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,790
come up on stages like this and tell

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,290
everybody well you can use free software

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,959
if you want but you realize you're

00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,790
killing innovation in the industry right

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,820
rubbish free software is now leading an

00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,020
innovation it's where it happens that's

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,370
so how we talk about it right we talk

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,489
about free software in terms of almost

00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:54,120
business goals innovation market share

00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,700
where are we dominating that is not what

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,220
makes free software important it's what

00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,260
makes it relevant to most people in this

00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,390
planet but it's not what makes it

00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,700
important it's not as best feature let's

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,769
rewind a little bit first go back in

00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,750
time I'm gonna bore you with a bit of my

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:16,290
own experience with free software not

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,880
too much hopefully but I think that by

00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,250
telling a story about it maybe we can

00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,660
identify together what with the real

00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:26,760
best feature free software is so Marcus

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,389
and I actually have something in common

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,389
they didn't

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:34,710
no that was a that we both found Linux

00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:36,810
in 1994 coincidence I found it in a

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,900
bookstore I was actually picking up a

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,249
book on sun OS they just released a new

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,610
thing it's gonna be called solaris or

00:04:41,249 --> 00:04:45,840
something weird so I was like oh crap I

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:47,849
gotta go upgrade my skills so i ordered

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,379
a really thin expensive book and I was

00:04:47,849 --> 00:04:50,789
waiting it came into the bookstore in

00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,849
the little town I lived in and I went in

00:04:50,789 --> 00:04:55,409
to go and get it she went is the back to

00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:57,509
the woman who owned the store when at

00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:59,909
the back to grab my book and eighty

00:04:57,509 --> 00:05:02,669
dollar book this thick ridiculous thank

00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:05,219
you son and so I was looking on the

00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:07,020
bookshelf and there was this book called

00:05:05,219 --> 00:05:08,699
slackware something or other it's like

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,110
slackware what the hell is that that's

00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:12,180
like slackers or something that's

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,289
ridiculous what a stupid name I picked

00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:15,120
it up and I looked at it and said it was

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:18,150
a full unix-like operating systems like

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,009
 that's not true no way I look

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,569
at the price it's like 40 bucks half the

00:05:20,009 --> 00:05:24,599
price of the book I wasn't buying that

00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:27,029
was just a manual for proprietary opera

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:28,409
as they say oh okay well what Harvard is

00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:30,749
it run on psycho it'll run in your 3d

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:32,159
says no that's not him so I bought it

00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:34,469
because like that's ridiculous that's

00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:36,750
not true i'm gonna take it home and it

00:05:34,469 --> 00:05:38,460
was true for me that was like a

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:41,699
mind-blowing experience right i started

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,050
out on very first coding job I had I was

00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:46,110
sitting in front of a machine that was

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,969
worth more than I made near and I tapped

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,009
and tipped away into a text editor

00:05:47,969 --> 00:05:51,210
making a do things tech said it was

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:52,529
actually free software I didn't know it

00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,979
at the time I didn't know about free

00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:57,810
software but this book told me this

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,810
Linux thing is happening and that was

00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,460
amazing went back to my high school the

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,529
next year actually just to catch up with

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,569
what's going on I'd helped raise funds

00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,089
to do a fiber optic network this is in

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:10,169
94 actually we raise the funds in 92 but

00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:12,270
it took a while for them to come through

00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:14,339
and for us to get enough volunteers to

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,259
pull cable and we wired the entire

00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,490
campus with fiber that was awesome and

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,659
then they needed something to run on it

00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,879
and they're like we're gonna use novell

00:06:18,659 --> 00:06:22,110
netware house like no don't don't do

00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,449
that I mean yeah it's cool and all that

00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,620
but the future is tcp/ip it's the

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,759
internet you should be running

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,319
everything and you don't have to like

00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,419
don't don't waste the money that we

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,860
raised on there's this free operating

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:33,569
system you can install it's called like

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,710
slackware linux and you can have

00:06:33,569 --> 00:06:37,169
everything include this new thing called

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,209
a web browser ver and it's gonna be

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,849
amazing one of the kids who actually end

00:06:39,209 --> 00:06:42,039
up setting up that

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,199
system got so turned on to technology

00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,059
because of that he went to Harvard got a

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:48,249
degree in has a very successful career

00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:49,959
now in that so I mean Linux is already

00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:52,029
making changes then but I mean we were

00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:55,990
few and far between there weren't many

00:06:52,029 --> 00:06:58,089
of us it wasn't though for another four

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,669
years I heard about this organization

00:06:58,089 --> 00:07:02,830
and what their message was the Free

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,069
Software Foundation assume you can read

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,439
that but I came to Linux because of

00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,779
features and what it could do right the

00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:12,550
pragmatics but then I heard about their

00:07:10,779 --> 00:07:14,759
message and they were saying well you

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:17,769
know what technology is really important

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,349
and the reason why we need to pay

00:07:17,769 --> 00:07:21,789
attention to it is because right now

00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:23,229
we're going through a moment in history

00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,969
that's going to be recorded it hit well

00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:27,459
they didn't say is this how I eventually

00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:28,659
interpreted it we're living in a moment

00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:30,009
in time it's going to be recorded in

00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,569
history books and five hundred years

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:32,619
from now kids are going to be opening up

00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,149
their history books and going to be

00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:37,300
reading about the time when the Internet

00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:39,179
happened we're living that right this is

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,319
tantamount to other moments in history

00:07:39,179 --> 00:07:43,029
like the signing of the Magna Carta

00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,229
which we have a few copies up still

00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:49,149
which you can still read because it was

00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:50,079
on an open format bello good idea but

00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:53,949
this is this is actually one of the

00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,419
copies that still exists this changed or

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:58,089
marked at least the beginning of change

00:07:55,419 --> 00:08:00,579
in how power was structured in Europe

00:07:58,089 --> 00:08:03,369
and European countries including North

00:08:00,579 --> 00:08:05,709
America this is still the basis of

00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:08,110
common law in much of the

00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,479
english-speaking world all right we're

00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,619
talking about a document that's

00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:17,019
centuries old 800 something years old we

00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,759
learned about that in school right the

00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:21,189
printing press changed everything as

00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:23,289
well it allowed people to put out

00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:25,599
subversive political ideas as well as

00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:28,839
body cartoons it allowed the novel to

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,819
happen books you read write the stories

00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:33,099
this is not possible when you had a hand

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,930
transcribe things who's going to sit

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,639
there and hand transcribe anything but

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:38,380
an important religious document or an

00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,599
important political document no one's

00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:42,159
going to transcribe you know oh why

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:43,689
Harry Met Sally that's not going to

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,740
happen printing press you can do this

00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,959
you can make a business out of it even

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,610
and this changed how people communicated

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,559
it changed how politics happened it

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,819
changed societies that's why we learn

00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,009
about it right

00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,629
now think about that put now into that

00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:58,309
historical context that what is

00:08:56,629 --> 00:09:00,739
happening now with technology and the

00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,920
internet and free software powering all

00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:07,790
that is one of these moments in history

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:12,230
okay so that's cool but how does that

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:14,360
make free software important well as

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:17,299
society any society that is reliant on a

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:23,809
technology is only as free as that

00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:26,269
technology is period full stop we think

00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:28,160
about the printing press the churches in

00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,589
Europe used to control the language of

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,259
religion because religion was one of the

00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:35,779
few tools of power that was really

00:09:33,259 --> 00:09:39,049
useful and by keeping education and

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:40,459
literacy bound into a small group of

00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:43,910
people you could concentrate that power

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:47,720
right as soon as there was a

00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:49,100
democratization of access to literacy as

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,679
soon as Bibles are translating to

00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:53,239
people's native tongues in Zurich where

00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,549
I live now we have a great Bible in the

00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:58,129
gross monster which is the zurka boo boo

00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:59,629
it's the first Bible written in in the

00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,860
local language of the time that change

00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:02,269
stuff is people have access to

00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:08,179
information and from there the

00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:09,350
floodgates opened power shifted but as

00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:11,119
long as it was under control though

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:16,720
society was hampered it could only be so

00:10:11,119 --> 00:10:19,970
free our society is reliant on software

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,679
increasingly how many people have gone

00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,339
to a doctor's office and not seen a

00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:29,029
computer in use how many people have

00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:33,139
engaged in a political campaign without

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:35,149
using the internet how many of you have

00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:38,389
purchased things but never on the

00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:40,249
internet how many people don't use email

00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:45,139
how many people don't connect with their

00:10:40,249 --> 00:10:46,490
loved ones via software this is an

00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,110
amazing revolution of talking an

00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,879
amazingly short period of time right

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,899
software took 50 years or so to kind of

00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:53,179
get to the point where was actually

00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:55,879
useful for the human beings like you and

00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:58,809
me not just the scientists that were

00:10:55,879 --> 00:11:01,790
crunching numbers right code breakers

00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:03,709
once we reached that point it just BAM

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,460
exploded our societies have changed

00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:06,230
fundamentally

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,610
it has changed our politics that has

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,800
changed or economics has changed how

00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,760
businesses are run it's changed how we

00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,620
connect with our loved ones even so put

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,970
this statement does anybody disagree

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,000
with that by the way does anyone think

00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:24,470
that our societies here at least are not

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,720
reliant on software yeah so put that

00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:28,720
statement and that statement together

00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:34,180
and you begin to understand what the

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:40,160
most important feature free software is

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:42,170
free software sets us free without free

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,970
software our societies will lose their

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,800
freedom whatever freedoms we do have and

00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,480
through free software because it is the

00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,950
technology upon which our society is

00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,540
based now more and more and more

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:52,400
increasingly so when we forget this

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:55,540
because we're fish in water we no longer

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:58,760
see it sometimes but it's happening and

00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,790
the freedom of our technology is the

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,400
limits to the freedoms that we will be

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,950
able to enjoy in our society that is

00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:13,250
free software's most important and best

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:16,460
feature when I realize that it was one

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:18,110
of those like wow moments all right I

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,100
realized that I was living you know I

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,810
always like to think I'm living in a

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:23,060
special time in history everyone kind of

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,640
thinks that it's usually not true this

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,470
is true though this is a pivotal moment

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,230
in history it's really cool to be a part

00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:32,150
of but then to think that wow I'm in the

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,630
industry that's going to be setting

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,450
limits on freedoms good or bad that's

00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,860
really exciting and I felt like that kid

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,420
that was why in 1998 I made a conscious

00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:43,520
decision that my career would then be

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,110
working on top of free software and then

00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,640
eventually working creating free

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,100
software it happened in the early 2000s

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,350
for me it was transient transformational

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:55,270
for me because I realize that some

00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:57,890
software is transformational for society

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:01,510
now I want to digress for a bit so

00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:01,510
that's all nice and fluffy

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:10,610
who knows what is that I mean it's car

00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:19,100
mmm Tesla right is that not the coolest

00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:22,310
car no liar it is a pretty cool car

00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,410
though and and I'm actually stealing its

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,110
ASCII work here are you here there is so

00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:30,260
I'm stealing this like wholesale from

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:32,210
garrix we're walking by a small lake by

00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,940
where he lives and in coos knocked in

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,000
Switzerland and we're talking about you

00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,740
know the goals of free software and what

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,930
makes it interesting and useful and

00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,300
important any points out something

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:48,440
really really interesting he's like you

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,450
know think about electric cars electric

00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,780
cars had a really hard time penetrating

00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:56,000
the market right and it wasn't because

00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,580
they couldn't make them is because they

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,650
made them but they're like ugly like who

00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,420
wanted to drive them right people would

00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:04,490
drive them in spite of how they looked

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,590
in spite of the fact that they didn't

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,300
accelerate very well in spite of the

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,790
annoyance and awkwardness of charging

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,050
them all these other things inspire the

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:13,610
fact that when you got inside the car it

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,589
was just like a regular car accepted

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,910
stocked more but hey you're saving the

00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:18,740
environment right you could you know

00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:20,360
feel bit better about that there's only

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,710
a limited number of people who are going

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:27,520
to buy into that concept and so long

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:31,280
after our ability to make electric cars

00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:33,530
not only people are driving them Tesla

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,180
had a different idea right as a company

00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:36,740
they're like now yeah we're going to

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,750
make an electric car great finds Manahan

00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,060
but we're going to make an amazing car

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,140
we're gonna make a car that people want

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:48,170
to drive that happens to be electric but

00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:49,760
like they want to drive this car if it

00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:52,700
had a gas engine in it they drive it too

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,280
if they want to and what happened well

00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,080
electric cars got like really a lot more

00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,030
popular and people were like proud of

00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:03,140
how I have a Tesla it's amazing look at

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,880
it and people you know I was at a party

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:06,080
last year and someone pulled up in their

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,450
Tesla and plugged it in and people came

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:11,750
out looked out like wow cool right it's

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:14,450
a cool car and that was a way of getting

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:15,630
the idea of electric cars well that's a

00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,130
great idea or not I'm not

00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:19,050
pass judgment that but it was a way to

00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:20,790
get that concept that struggled actually

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,680
into the market why because they made a

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,860
great product not because they made an

00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:32,460
electric car they made a great product

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:36,480
here it so I assume you can probably

00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:39,930
already see the analogy we need to make

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,970
great products we won't need to make

00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:45,300
software people want to use not because

00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:48,090
it's free as in freedom or phrase in no

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,980
cost we need to make software that is so

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:54,000
damn great that people use it because

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:56,550
it's so damn great I'm a little

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,490
concerned about earlier slide I said you

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:03,000
know it linux is number one in mobile

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:05,760
free software is as well but I'm torn

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,140
about that slide because i think that

00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,230
the path that it's going down in the

00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,150
mobile industries is concerning i'm not

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,130
sold in the fact that although free

00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:15,420
software is powering this movement of

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:16,920
upstate android i don't know if that's

00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,410
the best in fact i'm pretty sure it's

00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:22,680
not the best that can be done probably

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,810
not society needs all right we talked to

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,810
companies all the time right now that

00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:29,280
are finally waking up to the idea that

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,570
maybe they shouldn't be entrusting all

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,390
their data and all their communication

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,430
to a for-profit company with the private

00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:37,920
area products that servers they don't

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,310
have access to and whatnot this is

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,310
problematic

00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,900
but Android is top of the hill why it

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,580
was good enough and they put a lot of

00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:53,410
money behind the marketing and they made

00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:56,320
it go people don't use Android because

00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,870
free software either right I mean how

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,370
many maybe except for you guys but how

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:02,650
many of your family and friends you

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:03,820
aren't like technology people how many

00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:05,199
them when I bought an undred form

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,930
because it's like it's got Linux and

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:15,309
it's like free software please show of

00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:17,980
hands zero no one cares right so a lot

00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,110
of those wins for free software happened

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,640
not because it's free as in freedom but

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,439
because there were good products cloud

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,370
is no different supercomputing is no

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:25,510
different they weren't like you know

00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:26,589
what aren't super computer should be

00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,209
powered by priests offer because that's

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,770
better to society nobody said that

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,260
they're like how can we build the most

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:33,429
powerful supercomputers ever and Linux

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,840
was just there and it was a good tool

00:17:33,429 --> 00:17:38,920
for it right and they turned it into

00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,650
something amazing so I challenge all of

00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:43,090
you here both at the opens user

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,150
conference and the colab conference

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:50,620
summit that starts tomorrow to think

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:55,890
about free software in this way it's key

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:59,740
that was cool see if I can do that again

00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:03,100
it's key in terms of limiting or

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:06,160
allowing freedom in our societies it is

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:08,500
at the heart of transforming our

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,050
culture's and our communities it's

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,030
really important stop but the way we

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:14,620
actually get it out there is not by

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,260
unfortunately time people about free

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,840
software because that's a limited

00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:22,330
unfortunately selling point for most

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,450
people it also isn't getting hung up on

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,320
things like it it's gnu/linux it's a

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,700
disappointment for me with the Free

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,580
Software Foundation to be honest in

00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,830
recent years that the message has gotten

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,270
I don't think many many new people and

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:37,480
young kids would actually hear the

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:40,840
message I here I heard you know 15 years

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,280
ago from them the way we get free

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,910
software out there is by making great

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:50,290
products and the presentations are

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:52,179
looking through the schedule now for

00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,760
this conference and after me there's

00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,080
like all these ones of the little purple

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,120
circle on it which is the technology

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,070
tracks as looking through is like there

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,120
are some really cool stuff here let's

00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,830
I've heard about this morning in the

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,620
various keynotes there's some really

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:08,350
cool stuff there I think you guys are

00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:12,850
making great product which is what we

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:16,140
need but allow yourself to be driven by

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:18,399
that higher goal make amazing product

00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,640
because that is what's going to take us

00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,220
from high possible world where things

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,649
aren't so great to one where freedom can

00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:30,669
happen free software needs to be our

00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:34,799
superhero and you guys are the one who

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,799
are building it thank you

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,500
no more of you get off the stage uh I

00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:56,400
think I've got a few minutes left is

00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:07,170
there any questions comments thoughts

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:07,170
yes yep yep yes

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:11,630
right so what would those repeats the

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,090
people who are watching it was pointed

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,170
out that you know amazon took android

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:16,640
and made their own device and it talks

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,470
to amazon's server so doesn't have to

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,520
always be through google I'm so much

00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,900
more happy that it's going through

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,440
amazon servers because that's obviously

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,730
a better company but I understand what

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,110
you're saying and that is that people

00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:30,080
can take these things and actually

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,400
repurpose them for in perhaps better

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,799
ways that is the beauty of free software

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,000
right you're not bound to using it the

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,080
way you're told to so at least there is

00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,570
that with Android that's absolutely true

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,330
that said I don't see a whole hell of a

00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:45,860
lot of inspiring movement in that

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:48,799
direction but I wish to be proven wrong

00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,910
right I hope I wake up in a year and go

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,840
oh I was completely wrong about that

00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,890
there's amazing things that were

00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,320
happening I didn't know about them

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:55,760
completely possible but yes least free

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,419
software gives us that off the option

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:03,350
that opportunity sorry maybe you work oh

00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:10,929
yes yeah like that with what could go

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:10,929
wrong anyone else oh yeah sorry

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,700
yep

00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,760
so just repeat the question if and it

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:42,800
correct me if I got your question wrong

00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,510
but basically it's in that the business

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,420
models and free software haven't evolved

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:51,860
much and you know since the FSF was

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:53,270
around perhaps even and is that a block

00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:55,180
or is that a problem for free software

00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,340
good he's saying yes I got it right yay

00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:00,380
so my thoughts on that number one no one

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,850
ever says you know the problems with you

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,290
know chocolate making companies is their

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:04,670
business model hasn't evolved they make

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,770
chocolate they sell it to you come on be

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,809
creative I don't think the age of the

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,760
business model is it anyway important

00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,970
what's important is whether the business

00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,800
model works or not right if you have a

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,150
500 year old business model that works

00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,610
great if you have a 10 year old business

00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:21,410
model that doesn't work yeah it's not

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,200
the age it's the question of yet does it

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:25,940
work or not obviously we've seen some

00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,650
companies where it works really well I

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,059
think we can all kind of go around the

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,530
room and say oh yeah that company does

00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:31,850
free software and it works well this

00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,500
company does free software it works well

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,140
we can also point a lot of companies

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:40,190
were a dozen here's the truth about

00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:42,370
business most startups fail period in

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:44,300
all industries right so failure is not

00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,370
something that you go oh crap you know

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,100
where we're failing yeah that happens in

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:50,990
business but we know that there are

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,120
business models that do work because

00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:56,450
there are companies that pay people to

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,520
work on free software can I who here put

00:22:56,450 --> 00:23:01,309
your hands up if you are paid to work on

00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,750
free software yeah so I think there's

00:23:01,309 --> 00:23:04,100
there must be a business model here or

00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,809
there that's working for the people who

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,580
can't see it was like pretty much love

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,580
all a lot of people it was our the vast

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:13,910
majority actually do any more business

00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:15,500
models yeah I think so because that

00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:17,780
would help with diversity of the the

00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,850
business ecosystem what I think is more

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,160
important though is to not look at the

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,990
business model but go what are we trying

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,760
to drive the business with right and

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,190
that's kind of the point with the tesla

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:31,100
car right is it's not it's not the model

00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:34,059
so much it's that oftentimes companies

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:37,670
go out promoting free software either

00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:41,990
with a non-free agenda around it i goes

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:43,880
back to the android issue or they go out

00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:46,460
with a product that's not either not

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,610
great or isn't communicated as great

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,419
right to me that's much bigger much

00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,919
bigger issue

00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:54,109
in the free software business ecosystem

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,669
because when you get a company that goes

00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:57,649
out and says we've got amazing product

00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,850
this free software thing is fantastic

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:01,639
i'm gonna tell you exactly how it is

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,109
fantastic clearly communicated get in

00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:04,669
touch with the possible customers and

00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:07,009
some of those companies have gone to be

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:07,970
billion-dollar enterprises right I think

00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:11,149
that's the problem not so much the

00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:17,929
business models that's a really good

00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:21,950
question yes the products within the

00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:25,159
open source world for instance new gnome

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:27,529
or the KD 5 or stuff like that and and

00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,330
actually it's pretty amazing that if I

00:24:27,529 --> 00:24:32,450
looking at conferences I see a lot of

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:35,149
small companies who are maybe too small

00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:38,450
to make an impact so it's maybe not just

00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:41,570
the quality but also to my chair yeah

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,830
what's about that so again we have to

00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:46,700
realize that for a lot of these

00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,769
industries we're up against entities

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,330
that have been around for 30 years or so

00:24:48,769 --> 00:24:52,609
Microsoft started with not so many

00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,259
people right if you took Microsoft in

00:24:52,609 --> 00:24:56,600
1977 and put them here and be like

00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:57,889
that's another small company cool all

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,320
right they all grow but they've had a

00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:02,239
head start right in many areas in the

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,830
innovation areas not so much right now

00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:05,210
we see actually it's easier for such

00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:07,039
companies to succeed because they're not

00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,929
up against gigantic companies who have

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,389
mindshare we've taught people this is

00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:14,269
the way computing should be XP is the

00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:16,909
way it should be right so it's much

00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:19,999
easier vendor relationships aren't

00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:22,340
already built and those are very hard to

00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:26,779
read you know reinvent and it is in an

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:30,409
industry so yeah we do have a lot of

00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:32,450
great products that's okay there's small

00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:34,700
companies around it what worries me is

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:36,499
not their small companies now but that

00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,090
as they start to grow they start

00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:39,049
thinking about how they should go faster

00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,220
because they all have this idea in their

00:25:39,049 --> 00:25:43,700
head they shall be like 500 people

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,779
enterprises in like yesterday and a lot

00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:47,659
of these companies start thinking about

00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:49,070
non-free models and we're seeing the

00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:50,629
increasing rise of something it's very

00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:54,019
worrying to me personally and that is of

00:25:50,629 --> 00:25:56,409
things like open core neo proprietary

00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:58,879
models things that I think undermine

00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:00,019
right and are unnecessary because their

00:25:58,879 --> 00:26:01,220
companies that don't do that that are

00:26:00,019 --> 00:26:02,989
far more successful in those companies

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,130
probably ever will be and it's really

00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:05,900
tempting from a business perspective

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,160
see what kind of go you know what if we

00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,810
use that other business model where we

00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,960
just you know trade you know secret

00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:13,370
sauce for money it's tempting maybe we

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,020
can grow faster that way I don't think

00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,940
is actually any really good link to that

00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,040
in fact I know companies have gone that

00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,110
route and that was the end of what they

00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,160
were I think if you all think about it

00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:24,980
for a bit you can probably think of some

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,210
examples of that so it doesn't concern

00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:28,580
me that they're small companies we need

00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,220
to see them grow so that in 20 years

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,080
they're big companies I mean to talk

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,600
about red hat they've been around for

00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:37,730
quite a while as a company doing linux

00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:39,980
as has souza I mean both these companies

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:42,410
did not grow from small companies to

00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,850
what they are now in six months right it

00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:46,700
took them a long time so we need to be

00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,290
patient but in that in that time of

00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:50,270
being patient and growing I think we

00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:54,020
really need to ensure that people don't

00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:55,730
start don't fall into that that you know

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,280
tempting thing if we can grow faster if

00:26:55,730 --> 00:27:04,640
we abandon free software as a concept I

00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:06,050
as a rubbish concept so anyone else and

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:12,080
you'll tell me what i'm like dead at a

00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:15,230
time yeah one more I don't have to I

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,910
don't agree with one of your points all

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:20,180
those two of your points so the mobile

00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:23,600
in the mobile space yeah the free

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,850
surface I mean its operating on a linux

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,980
kernel the android phone but the rest i

00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:30,530
mean there might be free software but

00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm not allowed to edit it all the apps

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:35,150
i can buy there's no so there's no

00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,250
source code and it's growing and this I

00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:40,970
mean and this kind of containerization

00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:44,030
thing it might even go into software as

00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:46,010
a service all the cloud stuff Facebook

00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,290
Google what I'm interacting with I

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,480
interact with data and not it's cold I

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:54,530
cannot change the code on a remote site

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,750
so the development is going away what do

00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,160
you think about it so I agree with you

00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,330
in many points I don't think we disagree

00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,860
actually and that's actually why I

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,450
brought up the point of Android and

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,420
Google being concerned they are

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:07,190
concerned you know 45 minute talk you

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,360
can't cover the whole thing but I agree

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,190
with you that is very considerate what's

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:12,070
really concerning to me is that on the

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,470
one hand google continues to increase

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,149
the amount of proprietary software right

00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,710
that they put on Android and

00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:20,570
forcing people to use it to call it

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:22,369
android it's they're afraid of losing

00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:25,219
control the platform right they're

00:28:22,369 --> 00:28:26,989
afraid of the freedom which I think it's

00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:28,909
short-sighted and unfortunate but that's

00:28:26,989 --> 00:28:30,979
where they're going it is undeniable

00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:33,499
though that the world's by far number

00:28:30,979 --> 00:28:35,779
one mobile operating system which is

00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:36,950
Android is that it's hard mostly free

00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:38,599
software stone that's I think something

00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:39,979
that we should be happy about at the

00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:41,239
same time I agree with you completely I

00:28:39,979 --> 00:28:43,369
don't I'm not happy with where it is now

00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:46,129
I think it's evolving in the wrong

00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:48,739
direction right now for the issue of

00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:50,599
software as a service or things like

00:28:48,739 --> 00:28:53,719
online services like Facebook and

00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:56,359
whatnot yes there that is a absolutely

00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:59,570
huge issue a bone to pick i have with

00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:01,159
the sff FSF for instance is that they at

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,039
one point until was pointed out to them

00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,929
by somebody and they fixed it they are

00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:09,619
recommending gmail because it's free

00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:12,049
enough it's like what the what like it's

00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:14,269
bumpin the application is complete

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:15,859
proprietary off at the JavaScript that

00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:18,019
runs in your browser in fact you can

00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:20,239
turn it off and you just have HTML no

00:29:18,019 --> 00:29:21,679
another nasty JavaScript I mean that

00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:22,729
misses the point and the point is

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,629
exactly what you said right which is

00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:28,879
that we're losing access to the software

00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:30,559
we need to stop as a community number

00:29:28,879 --> 00:29:32,239
one we need to I think recognize before

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,499
I say what I about to say we need to

00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,089
recognize that their companies like

00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:36,679
Facebook and whatnot are contributing

00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:38,839
more and more and more to to free

00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:42,499
software which is cool so I'm about to

00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:45,619
slide them off now the free software

00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:47,719
community needs to stop collectively

00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:49,700
moaning and groaning about it and we

00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:53,830
need to do mean to roll up our sleeves

00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,830
and get worked on right

00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:03,880
that's the whole point of hat slide

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,650
right the FSF did not sit back and go

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,420
damn i wish i had an open source

00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,010
compiler an open source colonel man

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:12,130
someone else will make it and until then

00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:14,410
I'm gonna whine about it right that's

00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,840
not how it worked they went out and did

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,750
it and that was insane because it was a

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,030
couple of you know guys with various

00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:24,670
social difficulties sitting in an

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:27,460
academic environment hacking on C up

00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:29,320
against the behemoths of the world the

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:30,580
IBM's and the Oracles and all these

00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,290
people are already still you know

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,760
they're already running and son was was

00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,430
coming up in this era and they were you

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,650
know innovative you know aggressive cool

00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,530
young company and heard these guys like

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:44,710
oh man right who are they ever gonna win

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:48,970
are they ever F come on this can you

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:51,430
think but but they want it's it's it has

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,740
entered in many areas not all but in

00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:56,410
many it has become the dominant way of

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:58,720
doing things we need to remember that

00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:01,270
lesson remember it also took them like

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,300
it didn't happen in your 5 or your 10 or

00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:07,240
your 15 right but we need to actually do

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,290
the work and then be patient up to stick

00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,690
with it and the people who are doing

00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:13,060
that work we need to support them all

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:14,320
right we need to get behind them and use

00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:18,160
what they make and give them feedback

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,710
and give them support so shameless plug

00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,820
I right now I'm working with colab which

00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,660
is actually one of the reasons I'm here

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,510
collapse summit group where it's a

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:30,910
server-side thing everyone is moving is

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:33,370
being pushed towards a pair of

00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,990
proprietary online services that operate

00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:37,900
in the cloud and exactly the kind of

00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:41,770
applications you talk about we are

00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,090
working really hard and you know I hope

00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,840
that more and more people support we're

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,090
doing because I think it's very

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,400
important we are working very hard to

00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:52,000
ensure there's an alternative to this

00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:54,010
that is free and open you don't hear a

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,570
lot of us whining about it so much

00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,710
because it is a dangerous situation but

00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,750
that's probably because we're stuck in

00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,220
front of our keyboards behind our

00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:03,490
monitors working as hard as we can on it

00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,200
and that's what needs to happen so I

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,580
have like two minutes left or something

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,410
there was one that's to a question over

00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,330
here

00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:12,100
yeah sorry and feel free to come and

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,710
harass me the rest of day I'll be here I

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,430
do bar mitzvahs and babies but no no

00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:20,680
yeah so when you're saying that people

00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:24,550
are pushed to some other proprietary

00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:27,670
solutions and I also kind of have the

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,500
feeling that a lot of people of the

00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:31,300
general population but also a lot of

00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:34,390
people of the free software population

00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:37,030
are increasingly using proprietary

00:32:34,390 --> 00:32:38,770
software to get those things done why do

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:42,010
you think that is moving in that

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:45,250
direction so I think that there is an

00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:47,350
increasing acceptance there are fewer

00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:48,940
and fewer hardliners in the free

00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,590
software world which is normal whenever

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,350
you grow a small group into a large

00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:54,520
group you're going to get a more

00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,900
representational segment of society and

00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:58,210
it turns out that most people aren't

00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,470
radical right so it becomes more

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,410
pragmatic and that's fine that's just

00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:04,690
growth we need to identify the

00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:07,300
proprietary bits and work on replacing

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,590
them we need to hold each other so the

00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,140
people in this room are probably closer

00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:13,290
to the radicals than the non radicals

00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:16,090
and we need to keep reminding each other

00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,100
about this because we will forget right

00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:19,360
that's how that's human beings so we

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,040
need to remind each other this as much

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,540
as possible as constantly as possible

00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,700
support each other use of free software

00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,500
and that's why I give presentations like

00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:28,750
this and that's why people like you ask

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,880
