Title: OSC15 -  Andreas FÃ¤rber - ARM software development on openSUSE
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	A lot has been said already about how the openSUSE packages for ARM have been built in OBS. This talk will instead focus on how some of the tools in openSUSE 13.2 or Factory on your ARM system can be used not only to enable openSUSE running on more ARM devices, but also to develop software for ARM microcontrollers that cannot run openSUSE themselves. What can you do if no JeOS image is readily available for your device? What if not even the upstream kernel supports your device yet? What if your kernel starts to boot but shows no graphical output? How to get your code onto devices without external boot media? Don't despair, for many scenarios there's recipes that don't require you to take the device apart! Remaining obstacles and limitations will be discussed as well.
