Title: OSC15 - Craig Gardner - Hardening Your Linux Server
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	It is incumbent upon each system administrator to ensure that each system in the infrastructure is as secure as possible. One compromised system can endanger all. It's the simple principle of "a chain is only as strong as its weakest link." The principles presented in this talk will reduce the risk of vulnerability. The principles are based on years of expertise shared among the various distributions. Although the details are derived from SUSE Linux, the principles are universal to any and all operating systems. Don't get caught with your pants down, exposed.
