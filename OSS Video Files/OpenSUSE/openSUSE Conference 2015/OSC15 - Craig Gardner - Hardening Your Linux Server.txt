Title: OSC15 - Craig Gardner - Hardening Your Linux Server
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	It is incumbent upon each system administrator to ensure that each system in the infrastructure is as secure as possible. One compromised system can endanger all. It's the simple principle of "a chain is only as strong as its weakest link." The principles presented in this talk will reduce the risk of vulnerability. The principles are based on years of expertise shared among the various distributions. Although the details are derived from SUSE Linux, the principles are universal to any and all operating systems. Don't get caught with your pants down, exposed.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,420
again my name is Craig Gardner and I am

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,700
an employee at Sousa and I have

00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,450
sometimes played a role of pretending to

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,480
be a security expert but I spent many

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,850
years conversing with the variety of

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,460
people who are certifiably experts in

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,230
the field and I have spent many times

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,570
giving this exact presentation only

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,980
longer that I have tried to make shorter

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:27,539
for this presentation and one of the

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,310
most interesting things is of all the

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,279
things that I give presentations on I'm

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,500
asked to give this one the most even of

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:35,969
all of my red hat and blue friends

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,190
they're always saying oh come to our

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,129
user group and give us that presentation

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,110
on hardening and securing your system so

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:43,680
I'll try to get through this as as well

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,180
as I can

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,079
oh we've got that nice too up in the

00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,820
corner but we'll live with that what I

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,699
want to do today first is talk about

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,340
what and why about hardening some new

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,590
recent details about hardening with

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,199
newer distributions just to talk a

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,270
little bit about architecture and what

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,299
is down in the heart of what mean what

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,670
it means to be a secure system honest

00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,710
network that is inherently people always

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,320
trying to attack you and some of the

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,450
tools that would be available for you so

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,070
what should security be well my good

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,770
friend Roman dropped Mueller which many

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,960
of you know who many of you know he says

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,080
that good software does what you expect

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:29,340
it to do and does it well secure

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:33,960
software does exactly that but nothing

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,939
else and that makes sense as you think

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,720
about it but it's not instinctive to

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:41,490
enough people so as you talk about the

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,799
kinds of things that are involved in

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,720
having secure software you have a

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,430
variety of things that make things

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,490
challenging for you to keep it secure

00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,770
and you're always going to have bugs and

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,000
you're going to have crashes and things

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,189
that are going to cause your system to

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
go down which are causing all sorts of

00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,340
headaches for your organization but the

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,869
one that causes the most trouble in

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,270
terms of security is when you're talking

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,649
about the security vulnerabilities all

00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,659
those things that happen in the software

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,940
that caused the software to behave in a

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,959
way that it was not designed to do to

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,329
give access to be

00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,049
who were not intended to have access and

00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:18,659
that often could result in data loss or

00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:21,719
theft abuse of the system and privilege

00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,250
transitions one of the best things that

00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:25,650
I can do and if I communicate nothing

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,769
else to this quorum of people here today

00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,019
one of the best way to address address

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:34,049
security vulnerabilities and these other

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:37,500
challenges with software is to keep it

00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:39,269
up to date now to a body of people who

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,540
run proprietary software or run

00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,650
proprietary operating systems they

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,239
reject this a little bit they rebuff

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,049
against this but in this group of

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,939
open-source aficionados we understand

00:02:49,049 --> 00:02:53,849
this or we latch on to this very

00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:55,980
strongly now to constantly be able to

00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:58,530
apply security updates there are two

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,900
concerns number one in the business that

00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:03,299
you run that you work sometimes your

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,540
business operation does not allow you to

00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:08,280
apply updates in a timely fashion you

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,439
might only have these small windows of

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,480
opportunities to be able to apply your

00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:16,440
security out the security updates and

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,750
that requires some convincing of your

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:21,750
management organization that at least

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,329
let me apply the security updates I can

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,919
wait until some other window nine months

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,439
from now to apply other kinds of

00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:32,689
software updates to fix other bugs but

00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:37,439
let me apply my security updates in a

00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:38,729
frequent and out-of-band style another

00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,439
thing that comes up when you're talking

00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:44,519
about these kinds of things is the the

00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,979
skepticism that some people have about

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,959
open source software they think well if

00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:54,299
I'm applying the latest updates what's

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,949
to keep me from introducing new bugs and

00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,859
new vulnerabilities with that latest

00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,750
update at least I know the devil that I

00:03:58,859 --> 00:04:03,329
have today and I don't know the devil

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:05,489
that I'm going to have tomorrow and yes

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:08,579
even though we advocate an open source

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,560
manner that there are more eyes and more

00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:12,720
caring passionate people that are

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,669
available to look over these changes

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,289
that are taking place you don't have to

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:17,430
look very far to think about the things

00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,930
that have happened recently that have

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,639
been around as vulnerabilities for a

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,130
long time we just didn't know it like

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,600
shell

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:30,100
Jacque and poodle but statistics tell us

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,900
that better to keep your system up to

00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:37,150
date with the latest security updates

00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,590
than to continue to be exposed to those

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:44,410
ones that have been around for a while

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:45,730
keep your system up to date there are a

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:48,310
lot of ways that we can look at

00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,960
hardening a secure system make your

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,760
system more secure but we're going to

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,980
focus on this bottom one right here in

00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,590
terms of that deployment and

00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,200
installation configuration phase of your

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,940
system and so when you're talking about

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,940
the kinds of things that are relatively

00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:06,190
new in terms of these security

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:08,170
capabilities note that we have the

00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,330
bootloader security which is a pain to

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,270
us in a lot of different ways but it

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,370
does provide by intent and in practice a

00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,780
greater sense of security for systems

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,630
that are available on your public

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,060
network another thing that you may not

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,920
like very much but that does provide a

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,280
variety of new capabilities to keep your

00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,380
system secure is system v as we

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,420
mentioned previously the more quickly

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,460
that the distribution responds to

00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,710
security vulnerabilities and provides

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,540
you fixes and the speed with which you

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,540
as the user are able to apply those

00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,580
security vulnerabilities is better today

00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,980
than it has ever been

00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,080
suza in particular we do a great job of

00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,000
having this very narrow window of

00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,880
vulnerabilities published and having

00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,070
patches available but our other Linux

00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,590
friends are also very aware of this and

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:58,930
those distributions are constantly aware

00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:03,130
of getting those patches out as quickly

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,960
as possible to and then anytime that you

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,940
can have the ability to apply security

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,800
patches without having to reboot is a

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,040
wonderful thing for your organization

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:15,420
and so these mechanisms that allow you

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,290
to do that like Colonel live patching

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,980
extraordinary mechanism that's available

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,140
to

00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,880
and it's also important for us to

00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:24,820
understand that it's not really always

00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,220
about what's the latest and greatest way

00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,020
to address the vulnerabilities or what's

00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,850
the latest and greatest technology or

00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,590
what's the latest and greatest tool that

00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,720
you can do these things what matters

00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,970
most is that you know how to properly

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,380
use the tools that you have and you have

00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:46,420
skilled people involved in doing this

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:47,890
that are caring passionate and smart one

00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,150
thing that I advocate that you do

00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:51,550
without going into a whole lot of detail

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:55,540
about this graph here is set up in your

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:58,360
environment a playground where you can

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,920
put your new servers in and test them

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,380
for security vulnerabilities before you

00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,090
put them out into production out

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,770
available on your DMZ if you have a

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,810
playground where you can test it and

00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:10,030
break it first and know what it is that

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:13,270
you want to do with it you are a far

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,370
ahead of the game once you put it in

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,420
that test environment and you've played

00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,800
with it in the ways that I'm going to

00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,830
recommend here in a minute and you

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,710
realize that yes this system is going to

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,630
do what I want it to do and only what I

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,870
wanted to do not anything else then you

00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:30,310
put it out into production view screen

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,720
sauce now these like I say use this

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:34,630
presentation in a variety of different

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,640
settings these are sleds slides but the

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,050
principles apply it's the principles

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,520
that we're talking about it doesn't

00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,720
matter what distribution that you're

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,520
using it doesn't even matter that you're

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,290
using Linux this is the purpose of the

00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,600
principles that we're talking about that

00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:48,460
make this more secure in your

00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,340
environment as you harden it as you go

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:52,780
through this first process here for Susa

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:55,060
Linux Enterprise Server the reason that

00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,370
this is important is that you're going

00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,290
to set up the mechanism whereby you're

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:02,260
going to get the latest updates for all

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:04,660
of the software so for sleds it's this

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,950
registration mechanism may be different

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,990
for whatever distribution that you're

00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,940
using and openSUSE is similar but not

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:11,410
the same as do you have here and then of

00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,670
course another important thing that

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:14,920
you're going to be worried about when

00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:16,630
you're hardening the system configuring

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,790
and installing this system are the

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,220
network settings so we'll go into the

00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:22,660
network settings here and this is a

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,400
little bit hard to see it's a little bit

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,590
too small but you can see that you have

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,540
a variety where's the stuff that I'm

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,980
looking for on this

00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,930
dick Euler screen I updated these slides

00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,760
and so I'm not as well-versed on this

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,190
but you've got this such where you're

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,990
going to enable the card and in this

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,990
case you're going to be setting up the

00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,340
IP address to be assigned by DHCP things

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,229
that are going through your mind about

00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,810
setting up the network card I switch

00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:47,850
over here to the hostname settings and

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,940
you have these two selection switches

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,940
here to change the host name by IDs DHCP

00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,450
there are some opportunities to attack a

00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:00,690
system when you can attack when a

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:03,120
service relies on a host name and the

00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:06,120
host name of that server can be changed

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,310
by DHCP if I can compromise the DHCP

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,310
system I now have a mechanism to attack

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:14,370
the servers within that system so be

00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,550
aware that changing a hosting by a DHCP

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:22,560
is probably not a good idea for

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:23,820
externally available services other

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,120
kinds of things that you would consider

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,270
on this particular screen note that this

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,180
site designation is now no longer valid

00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,680
some changes to our standards and DNS

00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,650
make this a problem but that's not

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,290
necessarily a security problem then

00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,640
creating users this is very important

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,080
this is very interesting and this is of

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,320
course the kind of thing that people are

00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,340
always thinking about in terms of

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,500
security and hardening but not

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:52,290
necessarily in the way that they should

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,600
be yes they're thinking about passwords

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,340
and yes they should be thinking about

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,500
root privileged passwords that are

00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,780
secure and not using the same root

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,270
password for every server those things

00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,040
become pretty obviously to most system

00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,710
administrators but another thing to

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,560
consider also is what kind of strength

00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,000
of password that you have in this

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,440
particular case this is demonstrating

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,510
that the password encryption method is

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,630
going to be sha-512

00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:20,250
which is state-of-the-art that is really

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,490
the best recommendation that we can give

00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,650
today you can do much better but we're

00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:28,110
content that you've got the compromise

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,899
of efficiency and

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,970
speed with the type of encryption the

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:34,709
travel of 512 and then you might look at

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:37,529
something like this and drill down into

00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:40,320
oh certainly you don't want to automatic

00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:41,970
login right maybe for your laptop and

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,040
certainly not for me I would never Auto

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,670
login on any system but on a system

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,930
that's on a on your public network

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,700
that's providing a service for your

00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,339
customers there's no way you want to

00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,500
enable automatic login one more thing

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,880
here about passwords drill down in here

00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,790
you notice that there are still a

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:04,920
variety of password encryption types

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:07,529
that are available including des des are

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,019
you kidding me why do you think that we

00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:17,779
still allow the system administrator to

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:17,779
use DES yes yes absolutely

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,579
for example if you've got any Sun

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,420
systems in your network and you're

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:29,690
running and is ype you still have to use

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:33,120
DES to be able to do that kind of

00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:35,160
infrastructure wide communication so

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,019
there are reasons to have this but if

00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,750
you can get away with not having those

00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:44,910
less secure encryption algorithms you'll

00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:46,740
be very happy to stay with sha-512 other

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,209
kinds of things yes the root password we

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,160
just talked about that don't reuse the

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,620
same root password on all of your

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,140
systems and try to use a secure one

00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,269
which is a whole different discussion we

00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,050
don't have time to talk about today

00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,690
interesting recent research about

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:04,350
passwords though we talk about passwords

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:07,260
in terms of using special characters and

00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:10,140
mixed case alpha new Alpha characters

00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:13,230
and certainly incorporating numbers but

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:16,050
the research today still suggests that

00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:20,519
the best passwords are nonsensical pass

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:22,410
phrases a series of words concatenated

00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,420
together that don't have any logical

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,970
relationship to each other something

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:30,740
that's still easy for you to remember

00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:30,740
but that would be difficult to be enact

00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:36,690
installation settings tahor gave some

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,880
really great optimization

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,220
recommendations a couple of sessions ago

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,260
when he was talking about optimization

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,690
and performance for linux this is this

00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,980
is security optimizations that we're

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:48,510
talking about here one of the things

00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,720
that he recommended is make sure that

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:54,560
you only install the software that you

00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:58,100
intend to provide as a service on your

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:03,420
system if it's going to be a web server

00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:04,860
install Apache or light your injects if

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:09,540
it's not going to provide any web

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:11,340
services don't install a web server far

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,410
more secure to not even have the

00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,320
software installed and you have to be

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,880
aware as well of what kinds of other

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,000
software that you're installing that

00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:26,010
could by dependency drag in services

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,500
that you're not 100% aware of package

00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:30,390
managers are terribly convenient when

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,670
installing all of the dependencies but a

00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,290
little bit does you a disservice because

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:35,940
it could be pulling in software as

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,100
dependencies that you didn't even know

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,600
that we're being installed pay attention

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,100
to what packages are being installed and

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,130
make sure you're only installing the

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,010
software that you intend to run other

00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:50,340
kinds of things whether or not you turn

00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:52,830
on SSH there are lots of there various

00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:56,370
different ways to administer a box the

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,230
nessus h it's very convenient but if you

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,840
can get away with doing other kinds of

00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,760
administrative things without SSH don't

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,940
install it don't enable it don't turn it

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:09,350
on one more thing about firewall and

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,060
this is a this is somewhat of a radical

00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,680
recommendation that I give you here but

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,810
this is something that Roman Dracula and

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,820
I would talk about quite a lot netfilter

00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:20,430
is a great invention and has provided a

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,840
great deal of security security peace of

00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:24,000
mind I guess is what I really should say

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,590
about what's going on on your system and

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,330
what's not going on and then a great

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,140
logging facility for those kinds of

00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:34,230
things but when you get right down to it

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:37,500
as long as you only have those things

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:39,600
listening for services on the box that

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,330
you intend to be listening and providing

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,490
service

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,890
and nothing else has turned on and

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:49,060
nothing else is listening your box is

00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:50,920
just as secure as if you were running a

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:54,490
net filter you might want to consider

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,770
just running those services and turn the

00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:00,670
net filter off and get some benefits of

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:01,960
performance benefit out of that no it's

00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,620
too radical for some people and that's

00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:08,080
fine use net filter it's a great thing

00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,700
consider what the alternative is and how

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,890
secure you can keep the box without it

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:16,120
you might be interested in seeing what

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:17,380
you can accomplish that away ah let's

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,790
see what other things should we talk

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:21,610
about here oh one more thing about

00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:24,250
booting it's very nice that grub allows

00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,010
us to put a password on the bootloader

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,720
oh that's really inconvenient but that

00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,230
is a feature that you have to be able to

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,060
to keep your system more secure so you

00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,980
you go down to the bootloader settings

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,050
and let's see is there anything else on

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,730
here on the screen booting from the root

00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:42,900
partition versus booting from the master

00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:46,360
boot part a boost master boot record MBR

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:49,510
it's mostly a wash in terms of security

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,950
one's about the same as the other but

00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:52,990
then moving over here to the bootloader

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,050
options that we have here you can now

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,510
put in a password protect the bootloader

00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,100
with password so grub is very nice to

00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,590
allow you to do those kinds of things

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:03,460
again not a terribly convenient every

00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,770
time you boot you have to provide a

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:09,360
password but can provide for you some

00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:11,140
significant security advantages and then

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,820
here you go through the installation

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,410
process pay attention to what got

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,030
installed and what didn't get installed

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:18,850
make sure you're only installing those

00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:21,700
packages that you intend to use good now

00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:24,610
once the system is installed and I'm

00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:28,360
talking very fast I'm sorry some things

00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,580
that you will consider to harden the

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,800
system after the installation so now

00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,970
we're going to do some configuration

00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,930
first we start with the network settings

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,940
we did a little bit of the network

00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:39,670
settings before we can do the same sort

00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,090
of thing here bring up the DHCP enabled

00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:46,510
card and switch over to the host name

00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:48,060
such and we can not have this change

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,190
host name by HD

00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,450
CP thing checked so that's good that's

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:55,050
all the same sort of thing and then you

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,750
have this is wicked which is a Slee SUSE

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,850
Linux Enterprise feature but the same

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:03,930
sorts of options exist no matter what

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,220
the operating system that you're using

00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:11,190
if you're not going to be using ipv6

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,450
turn it off and as a matter of fact some

00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,970
of the biggest challenges that we have

00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:18,480
about securing and hardening a system is

00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:21,420
the physical access to the ports you

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,130
might also consider physically disabling

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,990
those ports that you're not going to use

00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,000
because if I ever get physical access to

00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,880
the server and I can plug it in and

00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,660
maybe it's DHCP enabled I now have some

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,250
kind of way to hack the system so turn

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,470
off ports that you're not going to use

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,630
and turn off protocols that you're not

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:46,260
going to use of course if you're going

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:48,330
to use v6 use it let's see now one of

00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,020
the great things that is a feature of

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,970
the Susa environment that's not

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:56,580
available in other environments and I

00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,010
keep pestering my Red Hat colleagues and

00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:00,510
my boudreaux colleagues saying you need

00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,550
to get up to speed and be good like you

00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,190
guys like Sousa and have what we call

00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:08,700
the Security Center and hardening and in

00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:12,510
here you have this fleet of settings

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:16,160
that Susa is informing you and coaching

00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:18,540
you as to what could be set or unset

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,420
that will make your system more secure

00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,710
and tell you why it thinks it's not so

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,750
secure with the settings that you

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:27,720
selected you have a columnar I call a

00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:29,880
set of columns a table the site view

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:33,210
here where you can see for example the

00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,490
used magic sis rec keys in this tip

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:37,200
column here and then this tells you the

00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:39,840
status is unknown it doesn't know what

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,820
the state of that is and then gives you

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,830
a security status whether it's secure

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,570
this is an x mark here and then for

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:47,370
example down here we're just disable

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:49,350
remote access to the X server that's

00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:51,570
with a check mark because it's disabled

00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,830
these are the recommended security

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,020
settings for each of these different

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,120
things can you think of a reason why you

00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,990
might want to disable sis rekha keys

00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,990
from a security perspective

00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,840
if I get access to this virtually or

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:15,900
physically and I can press that sequence

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,520
of keys I now have a vast amount of

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:20,400
information and a certain amount of

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,290
control to that system so although for

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,130
debugging purposes the magic sis rekha

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,450
keys are extraordinarily valuable in a

00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:29,429
production environment

00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,130
I don't want those enabled make sure you

00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:35,340
disable those things to reduce that

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,610
security vulnerability so all of these

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:40,590
different settings and the status as the

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,020
as the security center is detecting it

00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,630
and the recommended setting for it great

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,010
thing and there are nearly a hundred of

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,110
these kinds of settings with

00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,700
recommendations including health value

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:52,679
there's a description button you

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,870
highlight any of these things here it'll

00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,250
tell you the the description of what

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,260
that thing means and why there's the

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,059
security implication and what the

00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:03,090
recommended setting is for it to make it

00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:04,500
more secure so quickly about

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,390
architecture and design let me check

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,740
what the time is before I get too

00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:11,070
carried away with this and know how much

00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:13,350
faster I need to talk one of the nice

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,720
things about the Linux kernel is it's

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,490
certainly not a silver bullet or a

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,490
golden hammer it doesn't solve all of

00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:24,299
our problems but it's been designed very

00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:27,140
nicely as best we can constantly making

00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:31,559
improvements to protect that kernel land

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:34,200
with a well-defined set of api's where

00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:39,260
user space can access those kernel

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:41,760
features it's a very nice design that

00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,880
that helps to keep the system secure

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,160
it's not impenetrable but it works

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,419
fairly well as from a hacking

00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:52,919
perspective from a system administrator

00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:55,200
perspective you'll want to always be

00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,840
considering always be thinking about how

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,330
the system might be compromised by

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,980
someone who wants to hack it and so you

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,380
have to kind of think like a hacker how

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:08,100
does a hacker think about compromising a

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,080
vulnerable system hackers are generally

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:12,120
lazy they're going to try the easiest

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,809
things that they can first and then

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:18,990
depending on how important it is how how

00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:19,510
much fouler there is in conquering a

00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,220
system

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:22,270
then they'll try a little bit harder and

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,590
a little bit harder and little bit

00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,230
harder but if you get rid of the lower

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,730
flying fruit and make it not worth their

00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,040
time and discourage them as early as

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,720
possible the less likely it is that

00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,180
they'll compromise your system so you go

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,800
from the outside in starting with the

00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,520
network later and then going down into

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,650
the kernel there

00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,060
well far as the network is concerned you

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,250
have a variety of things that you're

00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,880
thinking about we mentioned disabling

00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:47,470
the interfaces if you're going to use it

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,150
absolutely keep it enabled but if it's

00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:55,600
not turn it off disconnect the cable

00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,220
seal that Avenue off you want to make

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,210
sure that you're thinking about whether

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,850
or not the system is supposed to be

00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:03,370
doing IP forwarding vast majority of

00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:05,800
systems shouldn't be doing IP for it or

00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:10,300
forwarding if you're not intending to be

00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:12,370
forwarding turn it off you heard my

00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:14,110
recommendation about netfilter it's a

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:17,200
good thing I'm not saying that filter is

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,480
bad just consider what's going on we'll

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,470
get more into that as we go on here you

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,970
might keep a periodic record snapshot of

00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,860
what's in your ARP table so that you

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,320
know what systems are actually connected

00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,060
to your box and comparing that from time

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,400
to time what's in my ARP table today

00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,720
today versus what was there a week ago

00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,790
hey there's this new system do I know

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,990
what that system is should that system

00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:42,820
be connected to mine good way of

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,670
monitoring what kinds of systems are

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,960
attaching to yours and a variety of

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,850
other things that we don't have time to

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,890
delve into the next one is the port

00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:56,920
layer here it's a great idea in addition

00:22:53,890 --> 00:23:00,550
to this idea of turning off the net

00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:05,110
filter do a port scan from outside and

00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:07,510
see what ports are open sorry and then

00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,160
compare that to what it is that you

00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:10,990
intend to have running from the inside

00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:12,670
point of view and if there are any

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,350
discrepancies between what you get from

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:17,080
netstat and what you get from a net map

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:21,040
nmap I mean then you need to figure out

00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:23,110
what those are once you know what it is

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,520
that your box is serving when you intent

00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:26,230
to from the inside and what's actually

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,090
being advertised on the outside and

00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,800
you're happy with that there might not

00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:32,690
be a need

00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:35,870
you'd actually be running a net filter

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:38,870
and always don't lose sight of UDP

00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:42,210
sometimes it's too easy to overlook UDP

00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:44,490
now the next layer services disable all

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,770
the services that you don't need and by

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,320
that the best thing to do is just don't

00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,340
install where's this and remove packages

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,810
from the system that you're not going to

00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,700
use if the software is not installed

00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:55,140
then that's certainly not going to be

00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,720
listening on that particular point not

00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,490
going to be providing that service

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,020
remove the runlevel symlink of course

00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,550
this is you need to update this to be

00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,480
system D I'm sorry I keep forgetting to

00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:10,860
do that I need system D syntax for this

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,230
instead of kill the serves serve the

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:15,210
services that are running don't take for

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,650
granted that doing this stop mechanism

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,990
is going to actually do it once you've

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:20,820
done it look at the process list and see

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,870
that it actually is not running anymore

00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:28,110
Apache in this case sometimes you could

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:31,280
be deceived by the init system telling

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:34,170
you that it stopped and it really didn't

00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:35,820
next thing after a process level keep

00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,950
you have an understanding of what's

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,530
actually supposed to be running on the

00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:43,260
system know what all of those processes

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,700
are every good sysadmin will be able to

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,080
look through there and see oh yeah

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,240
there's the name service cache daemon

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,070
right there I know that that's supposed

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,930
to be running and if you don't know what

00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:53,040
it is then you can use rpm to kind of

00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,930
tell you what it is already course you

00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,880
could google and figure out those kinds

00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,380
of things deactivate those things that

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,570
if you don't know what it is now

00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,910
sometimes that's inconvenient to people

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,260
people are are using the service that's

00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:05,760
running on there and you don't know what

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,890
it is and you get panicky and you just

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,320
you kill the service so you kill it the

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,610
process ID and then they come running

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,170
into your office say what happened I was

00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,250
using that but that's always an

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,230
effective way to find out who's using

00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,910
it's not the best way to do it but that

00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,970
is an effective way to find out how

00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:23,790
critical services are alright so next

00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,190
one is files at a file system level and

00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:28,890
RPM does a great job of helping us to

00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:30,960
see what kinds of things are installed

00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,400
and and understand what things are

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,530
installed on the system that aren't

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,400
controlled by rpm that's also good to

00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:41,160
know you have in Susa linux this check

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,309
stat mechanism to go through and figure

00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,259
out what's

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:48,179
which permissions right you want to know

00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:51,159
what kinds of things have an s UID of

00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:53,469
seven and then have elevated privileges

00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:55,840
and being able to reconcile that and

00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,950
reset those sir those files that

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,989
shouldn't have those kinds of

00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,999
permissions and then there's the

00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:03,279
advanced intrusion detection systems

00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:06,869
that you can look at to see what's

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,509
actually installed on the system and

00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:12,969
keeping track of that those files off

00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:14,889
box so that you can make it a comparison

00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:16,330
last week that software wasn't installed

00:26:14,889 --> 00:26:18,609
and it's installed this way why is that

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:21,909
service and that software installed

00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:23,830
today at a kernel level is nice to have

00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:25,719
those mandatory access controls

00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:27,700
available to you and app armors an

00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:30,039
excellent way of doing that and here's

00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,820
an example of a rule for the what do I

00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:36,549
have the DHCP D the demon TCP demon that

00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:39,729
makes sure that it's confined into a

00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:43,330
space of memory and cannot exit out of

00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:46,839
that space so that they can't do any

00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:48,339
buffer overflow overruns to to to find

00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:50,739
information on the system that's not

00:26:48,339 --> 00:26:52,929
allowed in addition to a farmer we're

00:26:50,739 --> 00:26:55,779
glad to report that as far as SUSE Linux

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:58,239
is concerned we support both right we

00:26:55,779 --> 00:27:00,639
allow you to use SP Linux and that's

00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:02,710
back in Slee 12 - that's a great thing

00:27:00,639 --> 00:27:05,440
some governments require it and so

00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:08,399
having those kinds of choices are

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,809
something that we value in open source

00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:12,609
so some of the tools that you can use to

00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:14,649
do this you've got the security center

00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:16,599
that we were talking about you've got a

00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:18,639
parm or profile generator that helps you

00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,779
to manage to create those profiles for

00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:21,609
all of your applications that are

00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:23,139
running you've got the integrity of the

00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:25,809
files on the system you've got nmap to

00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:27,759
look at all the dependent ports and some

00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:29,169
different kinds of scanners that we'll

00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:30,909
look at there are all sorts of scanners

00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:33,070
that are available I'm kind of partial

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:34,830
to open the scalp but there are other

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,969
things that you may choose to use

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,919
monitoring your system is important

00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:40,570
things like a kinga or Nagios or maybe

00:27:38,919 --> 00:27:43,690
even ganglia which happens to be my

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:46,089
handle syslog monitoring like log watch

00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,669
vulnerability like open vas or tripwire

00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:51,489
and always configuration management is

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,739
something very helpful to consider it's

00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:55,509
tools like Susa manager or announced the

00:27:53,739 --> 00:27:55,960
new suits of machinery thing also helps

00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:58,210
to ensure

00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:59,860
you are getting profiles of what it is

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,780
that's running and what is not getting

00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:03,070
profiles of what's going on and ensuring

00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,660
that only those things are happening on

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:08,740
the server that you want to have

00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:09,940
happening man I talk fast I hope this

00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:16,680
has been helpful to you are there any

00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:16,680
questions that you may have run

00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:27,320
the next step is not on their ease

00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:28,789
reboot your server and make sure it's

00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,289
the same after a reboot because

00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:32,929
otherwise you don't know that it will be

00:28:30,289 --> 00:28:34,429
excellent so comparing between reboots

00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:36,559
that you've got the right set of

00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:37,940
services running to now and then every

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,129
time you reboot is it going to have the

00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,559
same reproducible set of services

00:28:40,129 --> 00:28:43,899
running on it processes running

00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:46,899
excellent recommendation thanks a lot

00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,899
others

00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,460
so if you want memory protection I can

00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,370
just recommend patching your kernel with

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,590
packs and if you want bro buys access

00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,930
control you can even use to your

00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:11,590
security which is really really awesome

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,280
and it's being well maintained as far as

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,760
I can tell

00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:20,560
good great recommendations thank you

00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:22,680
other thoughts or questions up here in

00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,680
front

00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:35,840
said something about systemd for finding

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:38,899
security so what does it provides right

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:40,639
security services so that that may be a

00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:43,129
very long discussion but I will tell you

00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:45,200
the most important feature of that the

00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:49,009
most critical thing the best thing that

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:53,509
we buy from that is syslog you now have

00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:56,539
a binary in encrypted in that sense but

00:29:53,509 --> 00:30:00,019
and now an untampered bull syslog with

00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:04,460
journal control instead of the regular

00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:06,230
text file VAR log messages that's the

00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:08,450
very best thing that we get out of that

00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,990
an it process that now can trap all of

00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:13,519
that and keep that in its own

00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:18,110
unalterable repository without just

00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:18,769
spooling it off to the file system is

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:21,830
that what you were going to say

00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:25,090
Derrick's Derrick's is going to make

00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:25,090
another comment about system D

00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,920
two more things I would mention is you

00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:36,280
can enable this control was disqualified

00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:38,830
us so even if your program doesn't spot

00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,720
it like be SFTP das you can say after

00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:42,220
studying only boosters code should be

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,800
allowed so if you have a demon that

00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,440
doesn't need exact you can get rid of a

00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,440
tech cycle and that makes most records

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,780
like great powerful capability I think

00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:55,180
that you can assign Obama profiles

00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:56,770
selinux profiles for your certain

00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,110
servers so you can have for example if

00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,990
you have instance officers the Fed at

00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:04,120
sign you can say Redis before this

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,590
service can only access its own

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,870
databases not the database for the

00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,720
second writer service fantastic I didn't

00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:14,080
think of that that's a good one too good

00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,270
any other thoughts well thank you for

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,290
enduring my fast-talking trying to get

00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,330
through a lot of material in a short

00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:21,550
amount of time appreciate you being here

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:25,020
and may you have hardened and secured

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,020
