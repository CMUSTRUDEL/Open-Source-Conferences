Title: OSC15 - Robert Schweikert - The Public Cloud
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The Cloud and Public Cloud computing are all the rage. The Public Cloud has somewhat moved passed the hype cycle, which these days is clearly dominated by Docker, and is moving into the adoption cycle. While almost everyone uses a cloud already this talk will take a deeper look at the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) setup of the Public Cloud.

openSUSE images are available in the major Public Cloud frameworks, Amazon, Azure, and Google Compute Engine. A brief overview of the 3 major providers is followed by a look at how things get there, the image build and surrounding maintenance and upkeep. With the background of the previous two sections the third section of the talk will focus on what can only be labeled as the "new" vendor lock in. We will take a look at the services provided by Public Cloud providers and how these services, while generally great and very useful, create a vendor lock in scenario.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,610
yes it is time to get going well the

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,349
public cloud who has heard about the

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:15,900
cloudy stuff that's going on yeah okay

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,520
well what is that thing huh so I'm going

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:21,900
to talk about that my name is Robert

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,230
Schweikart I'm a public cloud architect

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,410
at Souza you can reach me there rj sh sh

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:35,760
Y at opensuse org or are josh why at

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:38,570
Souza calm and you will find me what a

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,430
great place for conference huh opensuse

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:43,680
conference t as a speaker we get to

00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,559
drink beer everywhere else I speak after

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:52,590
drink water so this is really cool

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,649
anyway what I'm going to talk about it

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,989
what is this public cloud stuff to begin

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:01,350
with so I'll give you an overview most

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,110
of that is probably knew not new to you

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,880
sorry but I will talk about it anyway

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,439
and hopefully not bore you to death I

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,780
will talk about the big three providers

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,500
that are currently on the leaders in the

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,330
field then of course there will be the

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,729
question well okay so this is cloud

00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,960
stuff how do i use it we'll talk about

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:27,479
that and then of course what does all of

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,369
this have to do with opensuse right it

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,329
is cloud after all and as we heard this

00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:35,509
morning or just after lunch during

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,460
errands keynote there is actually a

00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:41,640
concern and rightful concerned so that

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:46,020
when everything becomes a service we're

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,909
just as lief free software right so

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,130
we'll take a look at that and we'll also

00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,890
look at the you know what I consider the

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,770
new do new vendor lock-in I won't take a

00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,380
bit of a historical perspective off you

00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,890
know where vendor lock-in came from

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:05,610
originally obviously now we're in this

00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,310
period where vendor lock-in is not as

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:11,849
bad as it used to be and appears we're

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,740
moving back into a into a time with the

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,930
with the public cloud

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,390
we're vendor lock-in may once again

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,120
become a much bigger concern that it is

00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:23,910
currently and we'll talk about that and

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,610
see and I'll provide some of my thoughts

00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,860
about that okay so what is this beast

00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:33,890
the public cloud what does that even

00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:37,710
mean so a public cloud basically is is

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:41,130
while it's one or many data centers made

00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,380
available to you everybody you and

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:49,200
everybody in the world over a public

00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:51,570
network IE that internet thing everyone

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,960
uses the cloud already probably while

00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:59,820
you use google gmail or g+ use facebook

00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:02,430
those are all cloud-based applications

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,670
or cloud-based services you know there

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,100
are others of course amazon.com and so

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:12,540
on so the the list of services that we

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:14,910
use today pretty much anything on your

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,580
on your mobile phone on the list of

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,600
services that we use today is endless

00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,760
and all those services are cloud backed

00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,470
what I'm focusing on more though is not

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,660
those services that are made available

00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:32,760
to us through providers that we either

00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,190
pay or we get spammed with

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,670
advertisements so that the service is

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,970
free what I will talk about is what is

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,130
known as IaaS

00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:48,210
infrastructure-as-a-service basically a

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,920
data center a remote data center where

00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:53,580
somebody else owns the hardware and

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,020
you're running virtual machines on that

00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,030
hardware so infrastructure as a service

00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,760
and that infrastructure as a service

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,770
available over a public network IE the

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,390
internet that's basically what we define

00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,390
as the public cloud

00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:18,590
so what does it mean when when we say

00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:21,530
you run a system on somebody else's

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:24,229
hardware on top of a hypervisor well it

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:26,240
if you think about it and say well in

00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:28,570
the end you are still the system

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,400
administrator right it is only

00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:33,320
infrastructure-as-a-service so whatever

00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,419
runs on top of that infrastructure is

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,210
made available to you through the

00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,900
internet you have to administer in some

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,310
way shape or form so that means well

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,320
it's pretty much the same that if you

00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,229
have a box sitting next to your desk

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,660
right you have to put an operating

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:53,180
system on that machine you have to put

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,220
applications on to that machine you have

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,949
to make sure the network is secure you

00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,080
have to make sure you can login you have

00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:02,300
to make sure that the applications that

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,539
you're running on that machine inside

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:08,030
that vm are doing what they're supposed

00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:10,280
to do so you need to look at monitoring

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,250
are those services that you're running

00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,139
for your company or for yourself and so

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,919
on and so infrastructure-as-a-service

00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:21,169
basically says ok you no longer have to

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:24,110
worry about exchanging hard drives or

00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:26,889
busted memory or connecting it to the

00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:29,060
right power outlet and whatever else

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:31,460
those are all those things that are

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:35,270
taken care of by the cloud provider for

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:37,400
you but everything from there up that

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,870
still remains your responsibility

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,340
basically you are the system

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,199
administrator and for companies that

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,360
means the systems administrators that

00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,990
work at companies that maintain data

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,760
centers no longer just maintains data

00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,669
centers but they also maintained while

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,440
data centers in the cloud so basically

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:56,449
instead of exchanging hard drives and

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,880
pulling network cables now they are

00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:01,550
ramping up and down virtual machines in

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,159
in a cloud framework and that's really

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:08,810
what infrastructure as a service is all

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:10,909
about and so basically SS a you have to

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:14,210
treat the running server just as if it

00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:18,320
were well your laptop or the machine

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:22,090
under your desk or the rack server in in

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,949
your server ok

00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,020
what is really nice about the

00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:28,449
infrastructure service model of course

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,090
is that it is pay-as-you-go right so

00:06:28,449 --> 00:06:32,979
many companies today you can walk around

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,690
and you can say so how much does it cost

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:41,290
you to run a rack or servers or one

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:44,470
server in Iraq and most companies will

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,690
not have an answer for that right which

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,360
is surprising considering that you know

00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:52,030
in this day and age all companies are

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,830
very cost sensitive and you would think

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:56,860
somebody would sit down and say okay

00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:00,850
what does it actually cost for me to run

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:03,910
a a rack of servers or to run one server

00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:05,740
in that rack right I mean you could

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,630
think well okay so that the equation

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,760
should be relatively easy well you had

00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:12,790
to buy you the thing right it's going to

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:14,200
last for a certain period of time you're

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,410
probably going to have to replace some

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,870
hard drives and you should know what the

00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:21,910
power consumption is so those are all

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,979
things that are reasonably quantifiable

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:26,919
but then you have to go and say okay

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,600
well but I need a person to bring it in

00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:30,520
I need a person to set it up and need a

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,060
person to connect it to the network i

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,130
need the person to manage any 1201 and

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,020
so the pay-as-you-go model

00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:41,470
infrastructure-as-a-service is nice for

00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,950
companies because it provides a at least

00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:47,620
as part of that cost equation a fixed

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:50,380
cost right Amazon Google or Microsoft

00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:53,710
they go and they tell you if you want a

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:57,240
virtual machine of size x for one hour

00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:00,220
is going to cost you X amount of money

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,349
sense for some machines and dollars for

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:05,680
other sizes right so that really goes

00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:07,630
from a couple of pennies per hour to

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,550
eight or nine dollars per hour depending

00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:12,070
on the size of the instance that you're

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:16,630
using and so for companies that provides

00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:19,060
a certain our convenience and that they

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:21,940
can say okay when i run this server for

00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,560
X amount of hours this is exactly what

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:28,330
is going to cost me no more and no less

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,250
and then depending on where the data

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:33,250
goes either in or out then you know

00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,810
exactly how many how much data charges

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,560
you're going to have and so on so by the

00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,599
end of the month

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,659
the company gets a bill and says okay

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,610
this is what it costs you and they don't

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:43,870
have that actually when they run their

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,990
own data center which is very

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:49,710
interesting I I find anyway and so that

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:53,200
gives a dead gives a certain momentum to

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:57,730
to the public cloud companies will not

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,680
necessarily save money but fixed costs

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,240
that is in your data center today turns

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,060
into operational costs that is

00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,900
predictable and that is some that's

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,060
worth money to two companies okay so it

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,890
is interesting from that perspective and

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,810
that's why I also see more and more work

00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:16,960
loads more and more companies moving

00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:19,720
into the public route the other thing of

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,640
course it's easy and fast right once you

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,500
have an account set up you log in you

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,200
fire up a machine and a few minutes

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,390
later the machine is up and running and

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,390
then you go you put your application on

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:34,089
it you configure it and well if you're

00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,640
clever you have a puppet or chef server

00:09:34,089 --> 00:09:39,010
or see if engine or ansible or whatever

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,020
and then it gets configured

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,760
automatically once it's up and off you

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,680
go right and so this is much faster

00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,570
obviously if you have to go you have to

00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,870
buy a new server you have to put it in a

00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,900
raft install it and so on so there are

00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,940
big advantages to the public cloud and

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:59,350
this is why the public cloud has such

00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:00,250
big momentum okay but the public cloud

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,020
is more than just

00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:05,860
infrastructure-as-a-service the public

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,990
cloud is also services okay all public

00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,540
cloud providers and I will talk about

00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,970
them the big three in some more detail

00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,200
later they offer services such as

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:20,200
database services ok so I can run I

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:22,060
could run I could be connected to

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,220
database that actually runs in Amazon

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,650
right here from my laptop and use their

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,230
database service and the database would

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:32,830
actually be stored as a service at

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,890
Amazon or Google or Microsoft okay so

00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:37,810
there is much more than just their

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,959
providing much more than just letting

00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:43,780
you fire up our virtual machines right

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,430
so there are services in the public

00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,350
cloud that you can take advantage off

00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,690
and it is not just software but also

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,660
storage okay so you can store

00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:56,590
data there on discs just as if you would

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:57,970
in your data center okay what's really

00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:59,620
beautiful of course is that these

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,420
companies that do this they invest

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,840
billions of dollars in data centers

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:08,490
around the world okay amazon has nine

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:11,470
regions nine connected regions currently

00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,230
google has three microsoft has on the

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,650
order of 15 and they're everywhere right

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,470
and so you can actually store your data

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,090
relatively locally to where you are and

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,710
even if you have business centers in in

00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,970
different parts around the world you can

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,710
still be relatively local to those okay

00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:31,570
and then there are tons of smaller

00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:33,520
vendors that are really local that are

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,260
you know based by country i know there's

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,150
you know there's a cloud service

00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,450
providers that are just focusing on on

00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,760
Germany and France and other countries

00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,790
so they all exist okay but they're

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,170
massive resources around the world

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,780
obviously the big companies they will

00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,240
have bigger data centers um you know in

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:56,170
many more locations but that depends on

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,390
how you want to use their services so

00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:01,840
now talk a bit about providers already

00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:03,970
let's let's dive in a little more deeply

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,930
in those so the big boys here are

00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,270
clearly Amazon Google and Microsoft the

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:13,390
next layer down I would say is probably

00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,940
HP and Rackspace and then there are many

00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:20,410
many many many many many smaller

00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,930
providers they dos you could say go look

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,120
at that there's a typo pro Reuters

00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,750
that's interesting I don't think that's

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:36,010
even a Dutch work anyway there are many

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:39,070
smaller providers so and as I said so

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,380
they may be country focused or you know

00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:46,660
regional focus like you know maybe some

00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:47,980
may be focused for Europe and those I

00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:52,000
don't really deal with so I don't have

00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:56,680
much to talk about so Amazon currently

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,210
is the biggest provider as we know as I

00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,730
mentioned they have nine connected

00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:02,889
regions there are two disconnected

00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,350
regions one is in China and one

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:10,689
say a data center they just run for the

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:12,579
US government amazon basically created

00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:15,989
the market of the public cloud they were

00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:19,239
the leader they've been there first um

00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:23,049
contrary to popular belief it was not

00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:25,299
created to use up access capacity for

00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:27,759
amazon com that they didn't need during

00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:32,019
the busy season that was not the reason

00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:34,029
that Amazon Web Services was born amazon

00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,609
web services was actually born from the

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,759
idea that you should be able to use

00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:44,589
computing as a service and by the

00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:47,169
relentless drive of amazon to make

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:52,540
pretty much everything available as some

00:13:47,169 --> 00:13:54,369
kind of api it is estimated that have

00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,759
about eighty percent of the market at

00:13:54,369 --> 00:14:00,100
present others are catching up the

00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:04,269
market is growing so those numbers are

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,689
certainly very fluid for the first time

00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:11,889
this month amazon actually reported

00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:14,169
separately the revenue for amazon web

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:18,100
services which is their division that

00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:21,040
makes that produces the public cloud if

00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,989
you want to call it a product that was

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:28,480
reported at 1.57 billion for the first

00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:31,480
quarter of this year so that's not

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:36,449
shabby when you think that you can run

00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:39,009
an instance for a mere two cents an hour

00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:41,709
yes and there are instances that cost

00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:44,679
eight dollars but if you think about it

00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:47,649
that you can run yeah I could say okay

00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:51,189
I'll run and run a web server for a

00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:54,610
couple of bucks a day that's not shabby

00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:56,679
that's a lot of money and of course they

00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,559
have customers that run completely on

00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:03,220
amazon netflix is probably the best one

00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:08,289
of the better examples okay netflix owns

00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:10,209
basically no hardware okay while they

00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:14,189
own the desktop computers of their

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:16,190
engineers and other things but they own

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:19,340
netflix owns know

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:23,740
servers everything that runs through a

00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:29,710
server that is served comes from amazon

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:34,580
everything netflix has made this move

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:37,480
many years ago and although they were

00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:39,740
hiccups and some of them well documented

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,070
this is running like a well-oiled

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:46,040
machine now I mean that the times when

00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:49,580
you go to Netflix and you get movies not

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:53,540
available or the movies hanging in your

00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:56,030
stream those are very seldom now so

00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:00,010
Netflix is a really good example of you

00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:02,570
know what you can do in the public cloud

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:06,440
amazon also as being a prime mover they

00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:08,510
have the most services okay as I

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,900
mentioned database services storage

00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:14,720
various storage services data analysis

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,000
services everything's being offered in

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,210
the public cloud now as a service and

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:24,170
more services are being announced you

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:26,300
know by Amazon last year at Amazon

00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:28,940
reinvent which is the Amazon Web

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,440
Services conference they announced the

00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,420
container service and a source

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:34,070
integration service continuous

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,800
deployment service and things like that

00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:40,910
so more services are being announced by

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:45,050
amazon and also that you know they're

00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:46,610
bringing new data centers online nobody

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,540
knows every where they where and when

00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:53,390
they show up but you know there's always

00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,880
there always expanding then we have

00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:59,210
google google is probably the number

00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:03,800
three in the market at this time google

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:06,640
actually entered the platform as a

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:09,860
service market first which is also cloud

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,020
with Google App Engine and most of you

00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,270
will have probably heard that and Google

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,089
App Engine was actually running for I

00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:19,579
would say two maybe three years before

00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,579
Google entered the infrastructure as a

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:25,040
service market the infrastructure as a

00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:28,910
service offering that Google has is

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,950
called Google compute engine they're

00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,110
really

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:35,980
driving towards simplicity simplicity of

00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:40,539
setup simplicity of the interface

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,539
simplicity of the user experience and

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:49,090
they're investing a very big effort to

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,740
catch up with with amazon and n

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:55,009
Microsoft at this point as far as

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:58,340
features is concerned ok Google

00:17:55,009 --> 00:18:02,119
stability is is fantastic you know

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:06,110
certain be as good as Amazon and is this

00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:08,210
a very nice platform to work with then

00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,970
there's Microsoft it's currently

00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:13,879
probably the number two player okay and

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:16,070
here what is interesting is that we get

00:18:13,879 --> 00:18:20,210
a lot of customers running Linux on top

00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:22,960
off well Microsoft F of a proprietary

00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:26,419
operating system which is kind of

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,999
mind-boggling in a way because well why

00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:32,600
would you run linux on top of something

00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:35,090
that is not linux in an environment

00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:38,929
that's even more expensive than when you

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,559
can go and run linux on top of linux and

00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:45,919
be cheaper but it is amazing and you can

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:49,159
and basically microsoft gets a lot of

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,799
pole right Microsoft gets pull because

00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,320
they're embedded in the enterprise okay

00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:57,019
those same systems administrator said

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:01,369
administrator administrate Microsoft

00:18:57,019 --> 00:19:03,320
whatever in on the desktop they have a

00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:07,840
relationship with Microsoft and they

00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:10,429
trust Microsoft and so that trust

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,320
continues into the cloud so when that

00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:15,499
company that is embedded into the

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,389
Microsoft ecosystem wants to move into

00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:20,559
the cloud and even if they want to run

00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:23,299
Linux they will move to Azure so

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,019
Microsoft is getting a big benefit from

00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:30,440
their 20 30 year history of being a

00:19:27,019 --> 00:19:32,809
dominant player in the IT industry they

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,269
are now taking that benefit reaping that

00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:37,820
benefit as people are moving into the

00:19:35,269 --> 00:19:40,220
cloud whether this will continue that

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,750
way or not is anybody's guess I will

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,300
certainly not armed

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,610
a comment on that however there are

00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:51,860
issues with with the issue or framework

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:54,870
it is not as stable as the other two and

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:57,810
well they are currently not really any

00:19:54,870 --> 00:20:00,540
good maintainable command line tools

00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:03,090
from from our perspective from a

00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:07,980
distribution perspective okay and and

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:11,970
that makes things a bit difficult all

00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,250
right so after this let's look at how do

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,820
you use this baby how do you use the

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:19,800
public power okay so first of all you

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,530
will need an account some kind of an

00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:24,660
account it's needed and that requires a

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:27,090
credit card okay it is a service and

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,700
that is not powered by advertisement

00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:34,740
this is a service that is powered by the

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:40,050
plastic in your wallet and so they're

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,640
going to want money for it but it depend

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:43,020
upon your credit card and you fiddle

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,130
with it for an hour you'll probably

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:50,940
spend a buck boohoo right there are

00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:53,070
people that use that use the cloud as

00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:56,220
the backup right they store gigabytes of

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,870
data for a couple of bucks a month so it

00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,490
is not like you know if you give them

00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,190
your credit card you're going to be in

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,440
for an arm and a leg you're not it is

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,740
really it is really cheap it is really

00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,020
cheap to try out okay generally there

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:14,390
are two ways to access this baby from

00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:17,820
the command line or through a web UI arm

00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:20,760
and here we go now we're connecting this

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,520
to two opensuse for amazon and for

00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,480
google we have the command line tools in

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:31,380
OBS they are developed in the clouds

00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,540
tools project and everything is in

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,150
tumbleweed and some of those things are

00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:39,060
also in opensuse 13 2 which just didn't

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,550
get everything into opensuse 32 but

00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:43,770
everything is in tumbleweed so you can

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,170
manage stuff that is in Amazon and

00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:50,910
Google right from the command line just

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:53,210
by installing the AWS CLI package or the

00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:58,130
Google Cloud SDK package on to your

00:21:53,210 --> 00:22:00,830
a tumbleweed installation or you can get

00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:05,450
them for opensuse 13 to from the cloud

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:11,480
tools from the cloud tools pack develop

00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:14,899
project okay Microsoft has decided for

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:20,120
better or worse to build their command

00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:22,010
line tools on top of nodejs and no Jas

00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,740
is a framework that is not really

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:28,190
maintainable from a packaging point of

00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:32,419
view because the way no jess has decided

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:34,220
to put all this stuff in one tree and do

00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:36,710
it over and over again with different

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,960
many different versions and it's not

00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:40,760
really maintainable we spend a lot of

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,970
effort trying to make that work and we

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:45,649
came up to the conclusion that we're

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,260
going to start a new project and write

00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:50,480
command line tools for Azure that can

00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,960
actually be maintained and there's going

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,090
to be a new project that the public

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:59,539
cloud team at Souza will announce in the

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:03,860
next two or three weeks those will be

00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:05,510
written in Python simply for well one of

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:07,279
the reasons is that all the other tools

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,419
are also written in Python and so we can

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:13,399
take advantage of some dependencies that

00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:17,929
are already maintained for the other

00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:20,750
tools okay so here's a Google compute

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:22,340
engine example okay basically this is

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:27,620
all you need on the on the command line

00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:31,429
to fire up and shut down a machine so

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:34,549
you can just g-cloud is the command then

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:37,460
compute is the subcomm and you give it a

00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:39,350
project souza cheesy test for example

00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,390
this is one of our test projects that we

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:45,470
use for our image testing for Souza

00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:48,730
instances that's what we're doing we're

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:54,080
creating an instance we tell it the zone

00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:57,020
google has three regions and two or

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,440
three zones within those regions europe

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:02,570
west 1b is one for example here you tell

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,850
it how big of a machine you want in this

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:09,310
case n one standard one is a one cpu box

00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:15,190
and then there you go is a image

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:16,600
opensuse 13 and that will always point

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,970
to the latest image that we have

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:24,370
released so in this case I would launch

00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:27,730
an open sewer 13.2 instance and then I

00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:31,330
give it a name and once that fires up

00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:36,250
you run G count compute and then you can

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:39,990
ssh right in through through the g-cloud

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:44,650
command and then when you're done you

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:46,510
delete it and that's it so with these

00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:49,150
with two with one simple command

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:53,110
relatively simple command you can fire

00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:55,780
up an open sewer 13-2 image or instance

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:58,540
in Google compute engine right once you

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,970
have an account and everything is set up

00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:07,770
so this is really easy and it is very

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:11,590
similar to to that for amazon okay and

00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:16,450
so now we'll look at amazon and we will

00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:21,690
see how well this is going to work if i

00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:21,690
do that alrighty

00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:41,610
okay so there you go

00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:53,129
yeah I was hoping for a little faster

00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:58,230
connection but all right so then of

00:25:53,129 --> 00:26:03,269
course I'm I already have an account so

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:07,940
i will log in to AWS management console

00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:07,940
maybe here we go

00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:27,909
there's a bed right Marsh worker now you

00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,909
see another email where you can find me

00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:42,590
alright and now the amazon web console

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:50,210
loads and here you can see all the

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:52,130
services that they offer okay so you can

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,890
see here at the top left corner I hope

00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:56,630
you can read that there's ec2 so easy to

00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:01,250
is the infrastructure as a service

00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:05,029
offering they have stains for Elastic

00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,190
Compute cloud so to seize ec2 then

00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:09,890
lambda asus is a service that was

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:14,179
announced last year at amma amazon

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:17,990
reinvent in las vegas lambda allows you

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:20,390
to run code directly in the cloud where

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,669
you no longer have to fire up a virtual

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,669
machine you don't have to do any of that

00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:30,649
you just write your code and you submit

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:33,649
it and it runs how nice is that lambda

00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:36,470
currently only works with JavaScript

00:27:33,649 --> 00:27:38,330
nodejs basically what happens of course

00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,820
in the background is that once you

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,250
submit your code to the cloud they do

00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,169
all the magic for you so they fire up a

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,980
virtual machine and they inject your

00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:52,039
code and they run it okay but as far as

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,440
your user experience is well the coat

00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,200
just runs in the cloud right so

00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,029
currently this is no Jas I'm sure that

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,190
in the not-too-distant future they will

00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,500
make this available for other other

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,299
languages i would consider scripting

00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:09,350
languages to probably be the prime

00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:12,169
target the next one down you can see ec2

00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:16,789
container service oakland center service

00:28:12,169 --> 00:28:19,580
is that you have a an image that already

00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:22,130
has dr installed dr. demon is running

00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,960
and through this container service you

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,630
can interact with the docker demon that

00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,029
is running inside of that machine so now

00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:31,429
you can run a virtual machine and then

00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:37,490
you can run docker containers inside of

00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:39,620
that virtual machine okay then s3 is a

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:41,659
storage service then they have you know

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:46,100
multiple storage services you can see

00:28:41,659 --> 00:28:48,790
they have multiple databases then

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:53,410
there's networking services

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:54,730
and on and on and on and on okay you can

00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,650
see now they're starting with mail

00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,040
service as well here work mail is a

00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,750
preview and so now i'm just going to

00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:09,370
show you real quick how we're going to

00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:16,090
fire up a oops where did it go that one

00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:20,410
yeah okay so we'll do easy to know sorry

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:23,340
I guess um alright that's better yep

00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:26,080
cool thank you ok and here you can see

00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:28,600
up here on the right you can see I'm

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,670
currently operating in the Northern

00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:37,330
Virginia region does this you as East

00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:41,350
and here if I click on that list you can

00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:42,790
see all the nine regions that amazon has

00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:45,610
around the world so these are the

00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:49,570
integrated regions okay so you have

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:51,280
stuff in in in Asia here in Europe in

00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,830
Frankfurt that was the latest end at

00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:56,710
data center that was opened and then

00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,120
three in in the US and so if i go and

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,190
i'm going to say i can't want to pick

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:05,050
one that's closer to me so we're gonna

00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:07,210
go switch to frankfurt oh okay here we

00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:09,400
go it's basically it's going to reload

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,550
the console which looks exactly the same

00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:15,070
as it did for you as East region okay

00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:18,520
you can see I have no running instances

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:23,140
here and so if we go and launch an

00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:25,060
instance okay so the first thing that

00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:28,540
will happen happens is that the quick

00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:32,140
launcher um is displayed and you can see

00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:34,780
what the suse linux enterprise so so

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:37,840
these are the companies that Amazon

00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:40,060
works directly with Souza and some

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,740
others and then amazon has their own

00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:45,760
linux distribution that is available

00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:48,370
within within amazon but of course we're

00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:50,800
at the opensuse conference and so we are

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:55,480
going to look for haha opensuse here we

00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:57,520
go and you can check those out and now

00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,650
we're just going to see opensuse images

00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,260
okay and you can see there is an open

00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,650
source of 13 to image that one was

00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:08,020
really

00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:09,850
East in 2014 11 26 so November 26 which

00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,910
is right around when the release came

00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:16,210
out we also pushed images into amazon

00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:18,100
okay so generally the team that is

00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,680
helping to maintain these images the

00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:23,710
image bills which are on which are in

00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,580
the project cloud images we try to match

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:30,430
the release cycle with these images okay

00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:34,450
so here you go there's a 13-2 that was

00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:38,470
released on early November there's a

00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:42,490
13-2 and then there's a 13-1 image you

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:44,710
can see so you can see we're trying to

00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,990
you know keep up to date and when there

00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,730
are big security issues then we try to

00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:52,890
update these images as quickly as

00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:56,590
possible so that when you launch them

00:31:52,890 --> 00:32:00,160
you get something that is not vulnerable

00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:03,790
right out of box if I then select this

00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:05,830
baby then you go through some screen you

00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:09,090
can you can select the instance types

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:11,950
and here you can see you know they

00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:15,550
amazon has the most instance type so it

00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:19,450
goes from one cpu all the way down to i

00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:22,560
think 16 is currently the biggest yep

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:26,560
there's a 32 actually now so you can see

00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:30,910
you can launch instances that have up to

00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,940
32 virtual CPUs with 60 gigabytes of

00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:37,690
memory and lots of stories and storage

00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:41,740
and 10 gigabyte network connection okay

00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:45,180
so that is sr iob the opensuse images

00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:49,540
are currently not enabled for that yet

00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:51,130
but we're working on that and then you

00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:53,470
will just go through the steps and

00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:58,060
eventually you click and you can launch

00:32:53,470 --> 00:33:01,840
one of those we can do that we'll just

00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:04,090
run with a micro instance you edit the

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,720
security group which basically says now

00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:10,300
what ports should be opened so you can

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,900
connect I have one configured here that

00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,530
is basically only open seat to arm ssh

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:21,610
port and now I did that again

00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:26,050
alright and then you can review launch

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:28,810
and then you can kick that baby off and

00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:35,620
then it will burn so there's my keep

00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:39,340
here which funny how that is named and

00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:44,860
then it goes and so now I'm running

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:47,860
opensuse 32 in Amazon Web Services and

00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:50,560
if we wait for a minute then you can see

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,230
it is now pending and loading and then

00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:56,890
it will run and then I could login why

00:33:53,230 --> 00:34:00,730
SSH I can install Apache or whatever i

00:33:56,890 --> 00:34:03,430
can open port 8443 or whatever and then

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:06,580
you can run your services there on top

00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:08,800
of opensuse the opensuse images have our

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:12,070
standard repositories pre-configured

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:16,270
okay so everything that the updates and

00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:18,340
and release repository source

00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:21,580
repositories and all those are already

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,170
pre-configured in the images if you need

00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,480
stuff from the build service then you

00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:28,750
just have to add those repositories as

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:33,670
you usually do with with opensuse 13 2

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:36,340
hour or 13 one and that's really let's

00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:39,040
see now it's running and theoretically I

00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:42,010
could log in you can see it has a an IP

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,040
address a dns name and so that could be

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:50,430
used to log in i'll spare you the small

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:54,790
print of my terminal ok so with that

00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:56,410
amazon that was amazon and then so what

00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:59,110
does this have to do with opensuse well

00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:02,470
as you saw opensuse is already in the

00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:05,650
cloud so we have opensuse images in for

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:08,500
public cloud providers ok Amazon Google

00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:12,070
HP and Microsoft and basically what we

00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:13,900
do is I get to pick you back and take

00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:17,200
advantage of the position that I'm in at

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:19,030
souza and say ok well if I'm doing work

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,310
for Souza we're also going to take the

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:25,930
same accounts and we're going to release

00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:28,270
opensuse images ok so that way but I'm

00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:29,690
not really in any way special anybody

00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,280
can really do this and then

00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:32,990
buddy well you can't use the zoo's

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,730
accounts obviously but you can build

00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:37,670
your own opensuse images and you can

00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,349
upload them to whatever cloud frame your

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:42,890
work you want and you can customize

00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:45,290
those images ok as I mentioned the

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:48,650
images are maintained in in the cloud

00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:50,630
images project which is in OBS so

00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:52,790
they're built with kiwi there's a

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:55,369
configuration file for kiwi you can see

00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:57,589
the package list that goes in there you

00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:59,329
can see all the code uncle magic that

00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:03,319
we're doing to get the stuff running in

00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:05,210
ec2 or Google or or Microsoft you can

00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:07,579
take those and you can derive your own

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,560
packages or you can help us maintain

00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:13,130
these and if there's something that you

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,829
think should be in the base images feel

00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:18,650
free to send a submit request or let me

00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:20,510
know and we'll be happy to you know put

00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:23,780
the package in if it's something that is

00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:25,579
generally useful right what we want to

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,579
do though with these images is make sure

00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:29,900
that they remain base images so you know

00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:33,109
we're not going to want to release a

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,230
packet a new image that has well the

00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:37,790
whole Ruby stack or all of Python then

00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,859
they become too big and cumbersome and

00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:41,839
it really makes no sense right so the

00:36:39,859 --> 00:36:43,880
customization and installation of the

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:51,230
stuff that you want in is really up to

00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:53,480
you ok I already mentioned we have the

00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:56,480
standard repost configures and the

00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:59,599
images we try to get them refreshed when

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,160
there are major security issues you know

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:04,700
heartbeat comes to mind everybody

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,740
remember that hardly comes to mind

00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,410
shell-shocked things like that then we

00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:11,089
try to refresh the images or if there's

00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:14,000
a buck discovered in the initialization

00:37:11,089 --> 00:37:15,680
code which may lead to boot failures or

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,530
things like that then we you know we

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,780
release new images oil we have

00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,599
functionality issues right if we forgot

00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,130
to include now let's say the network

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,290
stack which would be important because

00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,880
in the end the machine is running remote

00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:30,530
and if there's no network stack well

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,510
then you can't log in and that would be

00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:35,210
really bad for a machine that is

00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:37,190
thousands of miles away and so if that

00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:43,369
happens then obviously we're going to

00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:45,710
refresh the images and release them ok

00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:47,539
far as packages is concerned so each

00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:51,200
cloud provider has their own special

00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:53,660
sauce okay that means they have special

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,609
stuff on how they treat a running

00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:59,539
instance how they initial I how the

00:37:55,609 --> 00:38:03,109
entity instance gets initialized and how

00:37:59,539 --> 00:38:05,089
stuff gets in it okay so as far as stuff

00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:08,240
getting in it one thing that's important

00:38:05,089 --> 00:38:10,819
obviously is well yeah SSH key again

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:13,819
blogging into a remote machine is really

00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:16,160
important because well the machine is

00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:17,660
remote if you can't login then it's kind

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,589
of useless that it's running there to

00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:23,480
begin with and so how the ssh key gets

00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:25,999
injected and stuff like that that is

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,210
really while it's different per cloud

00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:31,970
provider okay one tool that seems to be

00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:33,769
emerging as something that's coming

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:36,859
around to be somewhat of a standard is

00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:41,420
cloud in it and we do use cloud in it

00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:44,749
for amazon today we are looking at using

00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:47,269
it for Asher and eventually Google but

00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:49,039
they're either and Google do some other

00:38:47,269 --> 00:38:51,039
stuff with their initialization tools

00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:54,410
that cloud in it doesn't want to do and

00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:57,349
so the intermixing of those tools is

00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:59,660
still still a problem and so currently

00:38:57,349 --> 00:39:02,749
for pressure and for Google compute

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,529
engine we're only using and those

00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:08,589
initialization tools and not a mixture

00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:12,200
so we package all those initialization

00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:15,380
tools again those are all in cloud tools

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:17,539
project you can look at those and of

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,009
course we package the command line tools

00:39:17,539 --> 00:39:20,779
where they're available and and

00:39:19,009 --> 00:39:24,140
hopefully in the not too distant future

00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:28,720
we will have the beginning of a

00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:32,359
maintainable Asher command-line tool set

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,910
so with all that wonderful things let's

00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:37,369
not ignore the things that are not so

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:39,890
pleasant about the public cloud what I

00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:42,920
call the new vendor lock-in okay so if

00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:46,700
you go back a while on if we if we take

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:49,130
it trip on the way back train way back

00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,289
when we all started with computing well

00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:55,579
some of the younger folks here didn't

00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:56,830
but I'm not a little older side and way

00:39:55,579 --> 00:39:59,390
back when

00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:02,030
well what happened was you got

00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:04,670
everything from one vendor right so the

00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,340
IBM's and HPS of the world they sold you

00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:08,900
the box they sold the operating system

00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:11,540
they salted the software that was

00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:15,410
running on and they sold you the

00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:17,960
services to set it all up all wrapped up

00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:21,230
nicely in an expensive package and said

00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,690
here you go plug it in plug in the

00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:27,200
network and run it and that was

00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:28,970
wonderful until you decided that hmm

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,090
look now have all this wonderful

00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:33,890
equipment here from this company but I

00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:36,830
really like this other company better

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,380
today well now you had a problem right

00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:41,720
because those things didn't talk to each

00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:43,990
other and you try to move your data and

00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:46,790
while so you were pretty much locked in

00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:50,990
the next step of course was generic

00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:53,570
hardware Linux no vendor lock-in well

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:57,020
less vendor lock-in right we still have

00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:59,450
some issues standards in databases

00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:01,400
sequel and things like that so you can

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:03,380
transfer your data around so there's a

00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:06,710
lot less of us today then we used to

00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:09,040
have now if you look at what I just

00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,630
showed you and if you think of hold on

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,990
there these guys out there they give me

00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:18,740
database service and exactly you're

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:21,530
going back to where we came from so the

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:26,330
new vendor lock-in so things remain

00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:30,140
reasonably portable if you stick to the

00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:32,480
base images supplied from OBS or build

00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:35,450
your own or whatever right this is not

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:38,690
OBS specific if you stick to your own

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:42,110
images you build your own web front-end

00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:44,450
you run your own instance that is the

00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:48,170
dead is the database back-end when you

00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:49,820
do those things yourself you remain

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:51,920
reasonably portable of course you're

00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,650
still start storing all your gobs of

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,390
data in the cloud right because you're

00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:58,940
running your web service there so you're

00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:01,070
going to store your data there and it's

00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:03,620
going to cost you an arm and maybe two

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,960
legs to get your data back out but

00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,700
because you're running the database and

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:09,890
you're running everything you can get

00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,410
your data back out relatively easily

00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:17,480
alright so if you stick with the basics

00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:21,350
you're reasonably portable right you

00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,720
have an open Souza image in Amazon and

00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:27,260
you can configure the opensuse imaging

00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,390
google just the same way right be

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:31,730
through configuration engine or doing it

00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:34,640
manually and you can certainly transfer

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,980
the data from point A to point B cus

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,610
money but it can be done ok so now

00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,560
you're reasonably portable in this case

00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:45,620
of course you only depend on the web UI

00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,440
or the CLI tools and while you can learn

00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:50,360
a new web UI or you can use a new learn

00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:52,360
a new command line interface so you know

00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:58,250
that's not really that big of deal

00:42:52,360 --> 00:43:00,740
however and of course you know data out

00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:05,390
costs money but it can be done and it's

00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:07,820
not so bad but now okay things are not

00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:10,520
supportable once you start using the

00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:14,180
services of a given cloud provider okay

00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:20,870
so once I use the database that Google

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:24,890
Offers to me or Asher or Amazon well now

00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:28,940
I'm depending on their database and now

00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:30,410
of course well yeah sequel is sequel but

00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,830
we all know it doesn't really work that

00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:36,500
well right we know that I can't take the

00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:39,770
exact sequel script that I have well to

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:41,570
certain extent of course but we all know

00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:43,850
that doesn't work that well right once

00:43:41,570 --> 00:43:45,830
there is an extension people will start

00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,110
using it because it gives you a little

00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:50,810
faster data transfer or because it does

00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:53,060
a little bit of something nicer right so

00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:55,070
once you start using these extensions or

00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:57,830
whatever then while sequel is no longer

00:43:55,070 --> 00:44:00,500
sequel and I can no longer just go and

00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,830
take the database the data that is

00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,810
stored behind the database service in

00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:09,080
cloud framework a and stick it into

00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:11,060
cloud frame or be right so once you

00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,990
start using these services database

00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,460
service data analysis even storage to

00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:18,620
some extent because that doesn't

00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:22,160
necessarily match one for one you've

00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:22,930
seen in the in the Amazon console they

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,200
have four

00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:29,309
services right almost nobody else has

00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:32,410
forced or services they have one or two

00:44:29,309 --> 00:44:34,930
so that there is not a one-to-one match

00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:37,089
right and so now once you start using

00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,700
those extra services now you're

00:44:37,089 --> 00:44:41,319
basically getting back into the vendor

00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:43,180
lock-in right there is a vendor that

00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:47,650
gives you everything nicely wrapped up

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:50,680
in a bow and yes you can yes you can get

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:53,410
it out but it is going to be just as

00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:55,540
hard as twenty years ago when you

00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:58,900
decided to move from vendor hardware

00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:01,329
vendor a to hardware vendor B's box it

00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:04,000
is going to be almost just as hard okay

00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:07,690
and so this is where there is a danger

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,089
for free software for us open source

00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:11,950
developers right we develop a lot of

00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:14,920
this technology that is behind of these

00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:17,619
services that technology that gets

00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,770
wrapped up nicely in a web front-end

00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:22,210
that is proprietary obviously all these

00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:24,040
command line tools are open source

00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,040
because we can distribute them through

00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:31,510
packages right most of them are Apache

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:34,150
to licensed um but they get wrapped up

00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,400
in this nicely proprietary web front end

00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,430
and then once you stick your stuff in

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,049
and you use these services well then

00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:45,520
you're kind of locked into that service

00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:49,569
okay and so making those decisions you

00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,299
people have to think about how important

00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:55,180
or not important is this vendor lock-in

00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:57,190
right I've had conversations with many

00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,500
people about that and you know from what

00:45:57,190 --> 00:46:01,540
I hear many people really don't care

00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:04,630
about that much which is surprising to

00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:07,559
me considering the history where we came

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:12,849
from 2 to the point where we are today

00:46:07,559 --> 00:46:17,380
okay and that with that food for thought

00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:19,809
if you have any questions I will be

00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:22,390
happy to try and answer them yes and if

00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:28,480
you can wait for a microphone then I can

00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:30,830
actually hear you and others as well we

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:34,250
have come online tool for

00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:38,330
at least 22 vendors then how hard it

00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:40,370
will be to do migrate from one vendor to

00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,280
another even if they'd have some

00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:47,390
specific services maybe it's also

00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:51,080
possible to somehow migrated right so if

00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:53,570
again if if you if you operate the stack

00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:56,360
by yourself right so if you just take a

00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:59,150
basic web application and you say i'm

00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:02,180
going to run my database in an instance

00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:04,670
that I control and I run my Apache front

00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,580
end in an instance that I control then

00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:10,370
migrating that is easy right all i have

00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:13,570
to do is fire it up in some other cloud

00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:16,580
framework set it up exactly the same way

00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:20,600
push my data from point A to point B and

00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:21,950
shut where I'm coming from down easy but

00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:24,860
as soon as you start using those

00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:27,650
services well now you have a different

00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:29,900
problem right because I can't just get a

00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:32,180
whole of the sequel file in point a

00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,940
because I don't control where it is

00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:38,330
right I have to actually I have to run a

00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:41,060
sequel dump store that somewhere in that

00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:43,490
cloud framework then pull all of that

00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:46,730
down at once right I can't connect those

00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:49,370
services to each other right if I

00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:51,650
control everything I can connect my both

00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:55,160
both of my databases at the same time

00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:56,930
and I can run a sink right but if I

00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,480
don't control the whole stack if I use

00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:02,300
those services then I have to do well a

00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,980
sequel dump but if I do that what

00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:07,010
happens while that service is still

00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,200
running so I'm getting new data so now i

00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:11,030
have a problem right because i can start

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,070
sinking the databases because they're a

00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,710
service and i have no control over that

00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:18,020
so now i have a problem with my grading

00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,850
right and and that's where you get into

00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,860
a locking potentially into lock-in

00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,300
situation of course if you're willing to

00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,130
say okay for the next two hours I'm

00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,620
going to shut down my service I want to

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:30,770
take a sequel dumb i'm going to download

00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:33,890
it all push it over here upload it all

00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:35,450
do a sequel import and if you have

00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:37,940
gigabytes of data it's not going to be

00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:40,520
done in a couple of hours right then

00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:43,430
you're fine but if you have to keep

00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,170
everything running and you use you use a

00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:47,599
service that you're not under control

00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,369
always that you can connect then you

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:56,380
have a problem right you're you're

00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:56,380
locked in essentially other questions

00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:04,180
okay thank you very much thanks for your

00:49:02,059 --> 00:49:04,180
