Title: OSC15 - Robert Schweikert - The Public Cloud
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The Cloud and Public Cloud computing are all the rage. The Public Cloud has somewhat moved passed the hype cycle, which these days is clearly dominated by Docker, and is moving into the adoption cycle. While almost everyone uses a cloud already this talk will take a deeper look at the IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) setup of the Public Cloud.

openSUSE images are available in the major Public Cloud frameworks, Amazon, Azure, and Google Compute Engine. A brief overview of the 3 major providers is followed by a look at how things get there, the image build and surrounding maintenance and upkeep. With the background of the previous two sections the third section of the talk will focus on what can only be labeled as the "new" vendor lock in. We will take a look at the services provided by Public Cloud providers and how these services, while generally great and very useful, create a vendor lock in scenario.
