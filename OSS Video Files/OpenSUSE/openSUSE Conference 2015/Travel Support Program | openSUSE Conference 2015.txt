Title: Travel Support Program | openSUSE Conference 2015
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The openSUSE Travel Support Program aims to support contributors representing openSUSE at events, conferences and hack-fests with their travel and hotel costs. The program pays up to 80% of the travel and/or hotel costs for contributors who could not afford going to these events otherwise. In turn the contributors make a worthy contribution at the event and report back to the openSUSE community about what they did.
Izabel Valverde, lead for the TSP team, will talk about how the program works.
