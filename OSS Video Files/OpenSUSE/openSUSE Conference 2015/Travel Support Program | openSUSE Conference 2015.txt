Title: Travel Support Program | openSUSE Conference 2015
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The openSUSE Travel Support Program aims to support contributors representing openSUSE at events, conferences and hack-fests with their travel and hotel costs. The program pays up to 80% of the travel and/or hotel costs for contributors who could not afford going to these events otherwise. In turn the contributors make a worthy contribution at the event and report back to the openSUSE community about what they did.
Izabel Valverde, lead for the TSP team, will talk about how the program works.

	00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,620
right so this is an update on the TSP

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,030
the travel support program the opensuse

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:17,779
has there you can see the three key

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:20,640
people that manage and handle all the

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:23,310
requests that come through the

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,470
application to get to it is down the

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:31,679
bottom there connector opensuse dorg

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:37,500
full / travel dash support so what is

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:41,250
the TSP first thing to mention is TSP is

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,539
a privilege and not a right and that

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:51,420
goes for all applicants whether they be

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:54,899
a developer marketing advocate board

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:59,489
member whatever else nobody has the

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:04,369
right to the tes p its privilege but

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:08,630
every member of ounces community

00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:14,820
everyone that wants to promote opensuse

00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:21,979
has the opportunity to request SP

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:24,960
assistance to attend events or to

00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:26,729
represent opensuse quite often you have

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,670
to pay money out your pocket to travel

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:37,710
stay over whatever else the tsps aim is

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:41,909
to help cover some of those costs it is

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:47,640
not a guaranteed way of getting a free

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:51,590
holiday we will not reimburse one

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,590
hundred percent of the expenses

00:01:53,870 --> 00:02:01,250
so as I've mentioned it the TSP is

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:04,470
designed for covering the expenses or

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:07,290
assisting the expenses of somebody that

00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,410
wishes to travel to an event represent

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,110
opensuse whether it be a booth

00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:17,430
presentation any of those sort of things

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:19,170
that happens at events if you do have an

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,560
event that you wish to attend make sure

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:25,940
you add it to the wiki that way we can

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,930
track areas where people are going

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:35,310
regions if two people are presenting

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:39,570
within close reach maybe we could try

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:47,580
and actually improve on utilization

00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:52,670
there if it's something for say OSC it

00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:56,430
the travel expenses or the TSP budget is

00:02:52,670 --> 00:03:02,519
separate to its regular TSP budget so an

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:06,450
osc has got a pot of money allocated to

00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:11,790
TSP and it does not necessarily come out

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:13,769
of the regular TSP allocation one thing

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,459
to bear in mind is that the TSP does not

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:19,880
cover any promotional materials that you

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:25,130
wish to create and get reimbursed for

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:30,420
there is a separate local materials

00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:32,850
mechanism if you go to the link there

00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:39,590
that will get you to the right part of

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:43,890
the application so some basic rules for

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,870
TSP generally they've got a pot of money

00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,850
over around five thousand euros per

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:56,070
quarter the financial year is starts in

00:03:50,850 --> 00:04:01,040
April moving to me but generally

00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:04,430
speaking it's April rule of thumb is

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,719
maximum of eighty percent

00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:12,829
of your travel / accommodation costs

00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:15,190
will be covered if there is a very

00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:17,509
specific knee for one hundred percent

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,780
chances are the board will be involved

00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:27,430
in approving that additional

00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:30,680
twenty-percent expense you are

00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:35,660
responsible for making sure that you try

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:42,340
and go the most economical way possible

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:45,410
that makes sense so it may involve

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,550
taking the train rather than taking a

00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:53,840
flight so bear that in mind that when

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:58,310
you are making submission that it is the

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,599
most reasonable and efficient way of

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,599
getting from A to B

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:14,140
if it's possible to share the load then

00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,920
please try and do that wherever possible

00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:22,400
let the TSP team know that you are

00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:30,230
trying to spread the load of us if it is

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:34,580
an exceptionally high amount they won't

00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:38,750
be reimbursing any small expenses so if

00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:42,740
you've got a breakfast meal if your

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,240
train is 5 euros or 12 bucks or

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:48,680
something that's not going to get

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:53,860
covered this is for journey for flights

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:57,800
which tend to be 100 plus accommodation

00:05:53,860 --> 00:06:00,050
which will be you know in the region of

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:02,720
100 if it's for weekend or something

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:07,040
like that it's not for little bits and

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:12,260
bobs one provider is that whoever

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:20,830
applies for TSP can only apply once per

00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:23,780
calendar quarter so as I mentioned it

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:28,700
while starting an eight for this year's

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:31,940
can be starting a male so from a three

00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,800
months now that's one quarter another

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,150
three months another quality etc so you

00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,480
can only apply once per quarter and you

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:45,200
will only be able to apply for one

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,970
person per application so if you and

00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:49,700
your partner who happens to be a

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,970
contributor or advocate for opensuse are

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:56,060
traveling to an event each of you will

00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:58,460
need to apply individually you cannot

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,090
make a single application where you're

00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:01,090
both in there

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:15,660
so quick how to make sure that the event

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,080
that you wishing to attend has some

00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,460
relevance towards opensuse it could be

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:26,270
that you are going to talk at a fedora

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,580
event or a Debian event but about

00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:31,410
opensuse technology or about

00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:35,310
implementing something that they've done

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:40,020
on opensuse pitfalls etc try and keep

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:44,550
that link to open tues are there you

00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:48,890
need to submit your request no less than

00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:53,060
six weeks before the event takes place

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:57,900
if you submit it five and a half weeks

00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:04,710
don't be surprised if it's denied you

00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:07,710
need to use the application to get your

00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:10,770
request through to us sending the TSP

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:16,710
guys an email directly will not work it

00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:19,980
needs to be auditable and for that we

00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:21,930
need to use the application make sure

00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,419
you do press submit once you've entered

00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:28,169
all your details have been instances

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:30,990
where people have neglected to press the

00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,960
little button says submit and they

00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:38,729
wonder why they've not heard back about

00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:41,280
their TSP application please do be

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,860
patient after you've submitted your

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:46,650
application you may get lots of

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,160
questions back from the TSP team trying

00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:52,890
to understand why you've taken you

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,760
selected a specific route if you can be

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:59,240
as descriptive in your application as

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:06,080
possible that'd be great so if you have

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:09,180
selected to go by plane instead of train

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,259
please try and explain why you're taking

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:17,149
more expensive route rather than the

00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:20,119
the lowest cost it's just to better

00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:23,419
understand what it is so the train is

00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:27,259
going to take six hours as an example

00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:32,079
because it stops multiple places whereas

00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:37,549
the flight will only take two hours and

00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:41,899
you're going to be presenting early the

00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:44,600
day or later that day or whatever then

00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,549
the chances are your application will be

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:53,329
approved much quicker and you will

00:09:46,549 --> 00:09:56,059
potentially get your preferred route if

00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,519
the TSP team do contact you in relation

00:09:56,059 --> 00:10:01,819
to your application do please try and be

00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,499
as prompt as possible that way they can

00:10:01,819 --> 00:10:08,509
approve your application much quicker

00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:11,869
and also please do try and be courteous

00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:14,619
and polite remember that the people that

00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:16,899
are working with TSP team are volunteers

00:10:14,619 --> 00:10:21,309
they're doing it in their spare time

00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:27,339
they're trying to help you being rude to

00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:27,339
their requests will not help things

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,270
so you've applied tsp you've been

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,250
approved you got your eighty percent of

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,710
your travel expenses including

00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,660
accommodation what you do after you've

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,890
been to the event that they've helped

00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:53,540
you out with well firstly drop the event

00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:56,810
but secondly advertise and promote what

00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:59,450
it is that you've done one of the

00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:02,360
requests that we have with regards to

00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:07,040
TSP is that as a result of being

00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:10,580
sponsored you do do some form of ADD

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:17,680
vacations marketing spreading the love

00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:23,810
basically you've got up to two weeks

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:26,180
maximum so that's 14 days 14 after the

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:34,450
event to send all the appropriate

00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:36,590
receipts for tickets hotels etc if

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:43,220
they're not in English or they're not

00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:48,050
self-explanatory please try and mark on

00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:51,770
them or provide a note explaining the

00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:58,070
total purpose etc if you send your

00:11:51,770 --> 00:12:04,000
receipts after two weeks you will not be

00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:06,820
reimbursed if you're concerned about

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:13,750
getting the receipts to somebody in time

00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:16,900
please contact the TSP and if you're not

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,590
convinced Lee you're not happy but

00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:21,170
things are going to get there in time

00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:23,530
you can always see see the board we will

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,020
not be taking any interaction

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:30,440
interference action there unless

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:32,600
requested but please try and keep the

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,270
TSP team up to date on what's going on

00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,480
that way they are more likely to assist

00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,480
you further

00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:46,649
once you've sent everything in please

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:49,029
again continue to be patient with

00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:54,339
getting the reimbursement into your

00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:56,709
account there are several areas around

00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:58,809
the world that it does take that little

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,689
bit longer to get the money into your

00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:09,009
account due to regulatory requirements

00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:12,609
etc some banks aren't the quickest you

00:13:09,009 --> 00:13:18,489
should receive reimbursement within 40

00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:21,850
days from the TSP team receiving the

00:13:18,489 --> 00:13:25,449
receipts that is what we aim for there

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:27,309
are times where it may take 50 days in

00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:33,879
those cases we apologize but it's

00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:37,149
generally out of our control so making

00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:42,970
the decision easier for the TSP guys to

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:49,259
approve your request try and include

00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:57,779
your complete profile so full name etc

00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:57,779

00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:29,889
event what are you going to do if you're

00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:33,910
saying I'm going to be part of the video

00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:38,589

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:43,119
speakers monitoring whatever please be

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:46,289
as descriptive that way we can help we

00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:46,289
can approve much quicker

00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,490
again with transportation be as

00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:54,959
descriptive and as possible with regards

00:14:51,490 --> 00:15:01,569
to what the route is that you're taking

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:03,550
method etc with accommodation full

00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:14,889
address of the location that you staying

00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:16,329
how long etc was going to provide how

00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:26,350
much we've spent but I don't actually

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:28,899
have the details on me so as a rule we

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:32,550
have let me see if I can find it

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,550
actually I have it somewhere

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:52,300
so what we have done is generally

00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:56,530
speaking we do spend a full allocation

00:15:52,300 --> 00:16:04,270
5,000 per quarter we are trying to see

00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:10,810
if there's ways where we can increase

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:14,110
that budget but just because we have an

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:18,960
allocation of 5k and it does get spent

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:25,210
if you do request for TSP and it is a

00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:32,920
very valid and beneficial thing for us

00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:39,160
to do then please apply we have means of

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:47,490
ways of working around things so don't

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:47,490
let that put you off right any questions

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,740
