talk about it again and the main thing

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,350
that ties together my people under my

00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,870
president is that we it's also it's also

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:54,010
written in our passports that we are

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,770
striving to fight any kind of force and

00:03:54,010 --> 00:04:02,680
brutality and Harris landed this world

00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:04,570
by the application of humor and lots and

00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,320
lots of humor and do good things and

00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:10,660
talk about it again so this is our flag

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:14,290
the conch is this animal that you can

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:18,340
see here it's a sea snail we would say

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,440
in German and being part of the south

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:21,820
which Laurie that definitely is and yes

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,150
also the florida keys are part of the

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:27,130
south of the beautiful south we

00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,430
succeeded where others failed can we

00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,060
seceded from the US

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:35,449
in 1982 after some after some quarrel

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,870
quarrel about drug trafficking from Cuba

00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:41,270
to the US and stuff like that and there

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,090
was a five minutes press conference by

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,440
my president which was the mayor of Key

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,539
West and in this five minutes he

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,639
declared war upon the USA he declared

00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:54,199
total capitulation and he demanded 1

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,570
billion dollars of reparations and after

00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,050
that they have been some small events

00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:01,820
that even the United Nations made that

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:06,830
make even the United Nations aware of us

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:09,110
so we're on our way o mine to date 1982

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,729
that was it's gonna be in there later

00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,919
this is my passport I'm a diplomat

00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:17,570
hasn't told you so obviously was only a

00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,240
question of time until I was really

00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,300
really selected and detected and now I'm

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,770
a Jedi Knight guess what they are

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,120
fighting for the good cause of course I

00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,639
don't like to earth sabers across the

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,960
soul I chose the word as a weapon of

00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:40,280
choice this is my certificate of being a

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,919
Jedi Knight anybody still surprised that

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:46,820
after I chose the word I have a mission

00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:48,229
and I'm a diplomat so was pretty clear

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,750
that i had to be a journalist some day

00:05:48,229 --> 00:05:54,199
in my life and I've been doing that for

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,970
eight years and I never was unbiased I

00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,830
wouldn't say that if it was recorded or

00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,080
scented through over the Internet o or

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,490
on camera but I never was unbiased I

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,909
always had the open source told in my

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,500
mind and that also says my hype of the

00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:10,550
High Priestess priestess that ordained

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,080
me I I say hi to her I always was in

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:14,240
favor of the Oasis of the open source

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,500
mission that was the line of magazine or

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,090
is the name of the magazine germany

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:21,470
where I used to work and spend the last

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,789
eight years so but so much talk about me

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:27,919
that must be boring so here's some

00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:31,180

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,710
the bad the ugly no I can see you maybe

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,150
it's better to assume I'm just I just

00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,490
don't know what I'm talking about and

00:10:56,150 --> 00:11:00,560
what I'm well you see that and the

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:04,100
personal disclaimer at the back of the

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,290
stick and I went around the last days

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,780
and had some pictures shot at the Souza

00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:11,900
office in nürnberg just to show you

00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:13,310
again what good things we you everybody

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,450
in this user community of Pazuzu

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:20,090
community dip in the last well

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:23,270
20-something years this is the office of

00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:25,400
my colleagues of mighty where they have

00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:27,740
the posters of all the Susan

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,980
distributions almost all there's some

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,260
white spots are there these are the

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,850
books that they've written over the

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:41,960
years these are the cds dvds that you

00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:44,140
produce over the years well anybody

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,140
remember

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:56,080
well the really small one oops well that

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,430
was wearing all started in 1994 it's so

00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:03,820
funny that is that that was the same

00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:06,910
year that i started with linux to me

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,970
with lots and lots of floppy disks i

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:14,110
felt like this guy jumping on on the on

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:16,660
the roller on display device there was

00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:21,210
no extra little but the leno see in the

00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,210
left he was so i was stuck with the CLI

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,500
anybody remember this

00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:40,070
I haven't discussed with my boss and

00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:45,310
Liberty magazine where because he didn't

00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,310
believe that i had had one i started

00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:53,080
he said he had been around them also and

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,610
we were about 10,000 people worldwide

00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:06,890
that was amazing i didn't know that i

00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:10,430
consider my son some ways we can really

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,260
find strange things in your break there

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,190
were good times and bad times no other

00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:19,150
times and sometimes people felt like

00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:23,030
having to work with a split bring

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:28,520
anybody get this joke quantum mechanics

00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:31,130
little bit but in the end see there's

00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,610
plate there's free room in the shell we

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,690
can go on we can do more and we're doing

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:41,000
cool stuff right part of it the big

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:49,970
wooden chameleon is the big wooden Kiko

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:54,340
is Keiko yeah last week last week which

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,340
I was really amazing about that size and

00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:13,490
once a year I guess somebody said we'll

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:16,490
be doing that maybe twice a year it's

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:20,750
great fun and do good things and talk

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:24,680
about it loops and of course we're in

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:31,040
franconia no other linux distribution

00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:32,810
has that when what which means we we are

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,040
we have arrived at bread the present

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:39,260
what's the time oh that looks good and

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:43,339
at present time it is pretty clear that

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:47,690
there will be a big party so the first

00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:49,130

at overall we have 10 years of our

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:07,910
position 10 years they grow up so fast

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:10,430
this is crazy I didn't I can't imagine

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:15,050
it it's already 10 years hey you it's

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:18,020
it's and as I was told in August 2015 no

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,510
pieces will be 10 years old and the

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,360
board unanimously agreed to celebrate

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:29,060

really find them amazing my found him

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:36,740
already amazing whenever still was it

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,120
was at Linux magazine what does this

00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,709
picture show anybody knows it has

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,690
anybody been at the opposition mini some

00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:44,990
hidden in LA I shot this picture there

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,839
already I had a talk about the special

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:51,490
software that one guy in the second row

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:55,880
has developed some years ago any idea

00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:58,959
well what you see here is a buck that

00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,959
passes QA

00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,970
and obviously the tool that I'm talking

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:13,660
about is 0 PQ a an automated testing

00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:15,269
system invented in 2010 or something by

00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,950
Bernard vida man who's sitting here and

00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:20,260
it runs daily tests on the opposite

00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,820
development three main Factory well now

00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:24,250
it's not factory anymore it's cold

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:27,910
factories thunderbird ever Thunderbird

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:30,839
oh my god tumbleweed I wrote it

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:34,180
Thunderbird oh my god that's why

00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:35,949
sorry it works by booting up on the ISO

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,440
image which is automatically generate

00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:40,180
daily from the open build service in a

00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,970
virtual machine installs boot starts

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,870
some applications like Thunderbird

00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,410
that's where Thunderbird should have

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:53,709
been in and take screenshots during

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:56,800
install and compares it with pictures

00:16:53,709 --> 00:17:00,100
that have been shot before and thus can

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,500
give you red or green positive or

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,670
negative test results this is what it

00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:08,890
looks like on the website i'm sure you

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:10,480
all know it but it's not only testing

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,130
Susi it's also testing android for

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,400
example it's testing fedora and other

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,919
stuff or you can do that and as you can

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,250
see here the pictures taken during

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,770
installation here with fedora can are

00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:26,589
automatically assemble to a video so you

00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,390
can see the whole boot process a startup

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,340
process of the distribution or the ISO

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,360
image that you are testing so this is

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:37,150
the quality assurance of tumbleweed and

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,760
other things see one of the

00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:41,559
announcements laker then we already said

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,790
open build service that's an open and

00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:43,540
complete distribution development

00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,070
platform designed to encourage

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,419
developers to recompile packages for

00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,220
multiple linux distribution including

00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:52,000
Suzy opensuse read and agree available

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:57,940
to fedora TV and yes we are open Europa

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,440
cool some hundreds of CPU cores I don't

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:06,429
know what is the current state 600 or

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:09,460
800 is anybody know huh 400 but 600 400

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:13,210
400 to 600 threads work so good workers

00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,460
are running in building stuff then we

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,460
have kiri also part of the opposite

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,320
infrastructure

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:24,669
for building ISO images for building

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:32,830
operating system images and like for

00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:36,549
virtualization or CDs and DVDs and of

00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:38,700
course yes the true evergreen that

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:41,230
nobody else has everybody envies us and

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:44,700
the one central configuration tool for

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:48,580
both oppa Susan sleep you all know that

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:53,049
wow that was the present but has he got

00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:54,850
news not really I've got big news Suzie

00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,850
is awesome now if you think of some

00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:00,880
American Journal ex journalist now it

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,740
was Bill Gates it said that he said that

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,780
when Brian lon Duke left Microsoft in

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,049
1999 and when he had heard that he joins

00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:11,100
use it then she said Susie is awesome so

00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:15,280
Brian is with us welcome Brian how and

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:18,340
best wishes to America no that's not the

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,679
really news the news is um announced

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,320
first time announced by koodo culo on at

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:25,720
first and the sources of the enterprise

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:30,280
server will arrive in the Bill to Bill

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:33,850
in the Opie build service to explain

00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:36,250
their we'd understand some things

00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,049
tumbleweed what is tumbleweed tumbleweed

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,289
is a rolling release a tumbleweed is

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:43,480
that's a tumbleweed that's not a Native

00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:47,289
American plant it was brought to America

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:50,799
it's from some Asian desert or whatever

00:19:47,289 --> 00:19:52,570
and if the rolling really was the

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,830
rolling release of sushi factory was the

00:19:52,570 --> 00:20:01,500
development release and now it's

00:19:53,830 --> 00:20:04,360
tumbleweed is sort of both and then

00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,490
there were special secret projects

00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,320
running they were called core or

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:14,890
cornerstone but in the end people

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,270
decided to go back to the elements Oh is

00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:18,640
he somebody smile now when I said his

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,220
word Richard will this did really

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,870
explain all the details in this keynote

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Ludwig will explain on some details more

00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:25,570
some other details in this keynote and

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,659
the board will explain more details

00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,390
their keynote they're here so asked them

00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:33,000
the fact is elements

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:40,500
that was the super-secret Suzy project

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:51,480
SSSP introducing elements huh not the

00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:54,630
name oh you got me wrong huh the project

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,690
then cannot be named I got you wrong on

00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,990
that but the next thing is basically a

00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,910
quote of you from you from your mail the

00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,350
release or suse linux enterprise sources

00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,000
into Suzie build server will provide a

00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,540
sort of base for future of Pazuzu

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,040
releases for users that prefer stability

00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,290
in long term of a fancy research but

00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,790
maybe less stable new software sort of

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,430
like the difference due to bridge the

00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:21,320
gap between like tumbleweed or factory

00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:23,970
and slay sources right on that good

00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:27,990
sorry for the name I got you wrong at

00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:30,120
backboards is that right that's

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,590
basically opportunity for slae customers

00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,450
but that's some pot that's part of

00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:37,800
Ludwig's talk the next announcement

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:42,270
there's going to be a new I'll pursue a

00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:44,280
website is it up yet but that's the

00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:47,700
mock-up yet that's even just a

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:52,700
screenshot of the mock-up I said I'm not

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:56,910
tech and the next fifth announcement

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:59,240
always see is coming back home next year

00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:01,620
in 2016 I heard it will be in Nuremberg

00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,730
that's also something that's gone video

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,110
announced I guess that's what something

00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:08,480
the board is going to explain and

00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,480
