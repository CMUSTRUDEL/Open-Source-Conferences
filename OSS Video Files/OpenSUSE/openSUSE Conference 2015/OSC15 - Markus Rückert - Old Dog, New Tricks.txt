Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The only constant in the world is change. That said it might be time to revisit one of the staples of our linux infrastructure. See what has changed and how we can or maybe even need to adapt our configuration. We will cover things to improve your server and client configuration. But also newer things like server and client certificates. If you lock yourself out from your SSH server in the end you cant blame it on us. Just as a warning. ;)
