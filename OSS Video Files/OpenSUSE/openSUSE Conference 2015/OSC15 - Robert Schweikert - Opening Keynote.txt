Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The openSUSE Board would like to welcome all attendees to The Hague and oSC15.

The new openSUSE Board is looking forward to welcoming everyone to the openSUSE Conference. With a look back and a look ahead we will invite others to join us on stage to show how under the theme of "Flexibility through diversity" we work together around the globe to keep the openSUSE heart beating. In 2014 the first openSUSE event in Asia took place, booth boxes started shipping, Factory and Tumbleweed merged to create a rolling release. The recently concluded board meeting will have generated plenty of forward looking ideas to present.

Join the openSUSE Board in this session to open oSC15.
