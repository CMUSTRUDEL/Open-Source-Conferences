Title: OSC15 - Robert Schweikert - Opening Keynote
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The openSUSE Board would like to welcome all attendees to The Hague and oSC15.

The new openSUSE Board is looking forward to welcoming everyone to the openSUSE Conference. With a look back and a look ahead we will invite others to join us on stage to show how under the theme of "Flexibility through diversity" we work together around the globe to keep the openSUSE heart beating. In 2014 the first openSUSE event in Asia took place, booth boxes started shipping, Factory and Tumbleweed merged to create a rolling release. The recently concluded board meeting will have generated plenty of forward looking ideas to present.

Join the openSUSE Board in this session to open oSC15.

hold on to one of these or not not we

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,950
can oh that stand is gone so you have to

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,929
play the microphone stand and hold on to

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,120
this all right with that good morning

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:18,690
the board karaoke group is officially in

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:23,100
session we r minus 1 because he's

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,830
learning about earthquakes in Greece of

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,869
course after the tragedy in Nepal is

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:33,300
obviously very important and so we'll

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,250
get started I have the clicker so that's

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,280
why I'm have this non holdable

00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:41,760
microphone but I will try not to be

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,760
babbling the whole time so who are we ha

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:50,969
here we go haha oh and I can see this

00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,920
that's fancy ok so yes as he already

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,350
heard in the keynote yesterday my Marcus

00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:03,180
we're approaching 10 years of opensuse

00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:07,110
whew and at the last board meeting which

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,900
happened just a few weeks ago we set

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,030
together and instead of just winging it

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,460
for a change we actually sat down and

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:19,920
thought well we kind of see if we can

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,990
come up with some ideas to not be mall

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,170
continue to be everything for everyone

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:28,080
but make it easy to spread the message

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,759
of opensuse by being a little more

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,280
focused and so that's really what we're

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,500
going to talk about today primarily that

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,310
part of the board meeting and we'll kind

00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:41,520
of walk you through the little exercise

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:45,210
that we did to come up with what we

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,520
believe would be a good message for the

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:51,899
project to send to the outside world to

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,869
be a little more targeted the reason

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,030
behind that is also that as we probably

00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,640
all know the project continues to grow

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,610
tumbleweed is going gangbusters we're

00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,729
over 8,000 packages we continue to get

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,990
more contributors in the technical area

00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:09,899
but what we're not so good as a project

00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,310
is contributions in the non-technical

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:15,140
area and we SAT together and thought

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,970
so how can we get more non-technical

00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,360
contributors that are interested in

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,040
while organizing events right now we we

00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,950
have events that we'd like to have or

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,370
c16 is coming up next year then we want

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,030
to have our c-17 and so on so we need

00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,130
people that are not necessarily

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:34,010
technical contributors but they want to

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,599
be part of the opensuse project also we

00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:38,480
need more people that are interested in

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,690
marketing and so we had the discussion

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,510
and basically we think if we have a more

00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:47,180
focused message for the outside world we

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,549
can hopefully build more excitement for

00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,799
non-technical contributors to come and

00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:54,680
help the project in other ways than

00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,810
making packages right because it's not

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,019
all about the distribution it's just as

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,670
much about about the project and so as

00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,890
far as the presentation is concerned

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,940
we're just going to wing it along in our

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,099
usual way and then we'll see how it goes

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,099
and if you have questions of course in

00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:15,980
between feel free to interrupt us and or

00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:18,200
you can ask at the end we certainly

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:19,790
don't want to be the sole entertainers

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,260
up here although it's easier to

00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:24,440
entertain if you have more people on

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,209
stage okay so often what we hear what

00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,190
we've heard back in the past from people

00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:31,190
that run a booth or you know be at

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:33,709
events are basically these questions and

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:35,209
even internally as a project we hear

00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:37,489
these questions right well we make a

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,109
distribution but who are our users or

00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:40,940
who are we making the stuff all right

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:44,030
why are you spending your weekends and

00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,690
nights making packages or you know

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:49,340
fixing box and whatever um and so these

00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,310
are the basic questions that we started

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:54,769
with at the board meeting okay and then

00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:00,350
if you look at the wiki this is what

00:03:54,769 --> 00:04:03,350
you're fine right so which is you know

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:05,829
we're here for everyone everything as

00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:08,870
long as it's linux we want to promote it

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:11,420
that is obviously not very focused or

00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,109
targeted whatever word you want to

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:19,700
choose and so the problem with that is

00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:22,789
that tada well we're everything for

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:26,470
everyone everywhere everywhere opensuse

00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:29,590
but that also means we are for no one

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:31,810
no we're right because well if you get

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:35,010
these questions and you say well we're

00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,390
opensuse tries out then what the

00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:39,460
response is not going to be overwhelming

00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,540
for that right because you not really

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:46,300
have a good hook to start a conversation

00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:50,140
okay and so this was really the basis of

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:53,500
off that part of the board meeting where

00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:57,430
we try to figure out you know what what

00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:01,230
can we do how can we make this more

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:03,490
exciting for non-technical contributors

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:05,950
and who should be interested in the end

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,300
in in the tools and you know guys don't

00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:12,610
just stand there jump in anytime there's

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,400
a microphone there well you don't have

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,070
to dance that's may not be all that that

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,970
may be better tonight after we all had a

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,650
few beers but maybe not just we may not

00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:27,520
be ready for that just right after

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:30,480
breakfast but there's of course there's

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,220
good news right um despite all of that

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:36,790
we you know we didn't really have much

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,350
marketing for opensuse 13-2 and I think

00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:42,280
Richard can tell a really good story

00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:44,110
about that 32 was I mean we saw the

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,540
graph yesterday in my presentation where

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,180
it's been the most successful release in

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:54,550
terms of downloads that we've had ever I

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:56,229
mean over 130 out over 130,000 and you

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,700
know hopefully the next release whatever

00:05:56,229 --> 00:06:02,229
whatever it looks like would be the same

00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:04,740
but with 32 there was basically no

00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,640
marketing I mean there was a few others

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,590
throwing together stuff at the last

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:10,360
minute trying to get together

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,540
featureless trying to get together news

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,010
posts but it was really a lot lower than

00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,660
we normally used to try and do when we

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:19,780
had a big marketing team working behind

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,520
it same with the development of it i

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,370
mean the the actual development of 13 to

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,790
was primarily a tumbleweed snapshot but

00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,850
we just froze for a little bit

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,140
and yet we've managed to do a really

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,780
good job and get a really nice version

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,490
of their that lots of people are using

00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,450
yeah and and we got really good feedback

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,680
right which shows that actually the

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:42,380
approach that we're taking with

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,080
tumbleweed is paying off right we were

00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:48,020
able to just take a snapshot rested for

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,150
a little while you know do some final

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,670
touch-ups and and get it out there as a

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,160
release and it worked out really well

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,840
and considering the download numbers

00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,940
without marketing that is really

00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,620
phenomenal so you know thanks to all the

00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,440
contributors and that helped make as

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,630
possible and also to our tools and this

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,070
was kind of one of the things that we we

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,440
really took when we were thinking about

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,690
this is you know we're not just a

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,820
project that makes one distribution but

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,380
a lot of our sort of secret sauce that

00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,360
kind of unique identity that makes us

00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,460
different from every other project is

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,370
actually we have these amazing tools

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,510
that let us do all this crazy stuff and

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,400
we kind of really wanted to tie that

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,650
into the whole messaging going forward

00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,630
yeah and we think that you know overall

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,750
I think it also shows that you know with

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,400
with tumbleweed continuing to grow that

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:36,290
there's more and more interest in OBS

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,840
and open QA and some of the other tools

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:41,630
we have especially if you're open QA you

00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,450
can see that because Fedora guys are

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:47,900
starting to use open QA as well and not

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,300
just that as a distribution with a major

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,980
non invented here syndrome the Fedora

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,200
guys are actually contributing back to

00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:56,000
open QA which is really nice to see

00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,030
that's kind of like a turnaround for

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,890
them and well I'm personally very happy

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,390
about that they still hate the folder I

00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:07,550
mean they're writing everything in pison

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:10,940
and wrapping around Wow yeah whatever to

00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:12,680
each his own and so we were trying to

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:17,090
come up with you know some kind of

00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:20,450
definition okay so what we concluded

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,420
basically was that we should look at our

00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,750
strengths that that we believe we have

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:30,200
okay and out of those coalesced some

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,080
kind of focused message okay the idea

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,560
here is so you know just just dispel any

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,820
ideas of anybody there is no interest in

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,070
redefining the proj

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,890
right the project is defined on the

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:47,450
guiding principles of just do it those

00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:49,760
who do decide and work together in in a

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,280
nice and open collaborative and friendly

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,270
way and that is not going to change okay

00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:59,960
this is all about messaging and this is

00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:03,380
all about how do we provide a hook for

00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:06,230
people as I said earlier that you know

00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,720
are not necessarily non or that are not

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,760
necessarily technical contributors and

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,830
we definitely lack in this area and I

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:16,370
think it's probably nobody here who will

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:20,150
dispute that and so really this is just

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,640
about finding a good message that we can

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:25,550
use to help people that represent us at

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,350
events at the booth and and help us find

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,350
new people that are willing to do that

00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,890
okay so what we went through is we

00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,960
decided okay let's look at what we

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,240
believe our strengths raw and and the

00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,240
message for that was well I think we're

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,240
really good at tooling and building

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,120
stuff and I hope that everybody here

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,120
would agree with that so we have the

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,460
open bill service obviously we all

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,930
believe that is the premier tool for

00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:58,160
building packages and building

00:09:53,930 --> 00:10:01,220
distributions it is integrated with Kiwi

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,100
which then pops out the ISO images I

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,310
mean that you know that is fantastic the

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,170
whole integration how everything works

00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:10,880
we have open QA that you know has

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:12,830
received a lot of attention over the

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,590
year over the last two or three years

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:18,950
and it's you know really coming into

00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,860
high gear now on it's it's finding bugs

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:25,370
that you know come out of the build and

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:27,020
then flagging those issues and the

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,810
turnaround of getting them fixed

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:32,750
therefore is much better right because

00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:34,430
whoever put it in knows immediately it

00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,280
failed and and at that point it's really

00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,100
easy to fix right every every developer

00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,960
knows that if I put in code and I find

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,940
the bug right away it's a lot easier to

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,440
fix them find the bug half a year and

00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,110
then you have to sit down and figure out

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,089
oh how did I do that

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,920
and then of course as she asked which is

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:54,560
that you know the best administration

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,350
tool in you know on the Linux planet for

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,490
sure and we have snapper and and you

00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,800
know there are certainly a bunch of

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,769
other tools that that are really cool on

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,200
that we have in the distribution well in

00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:09,350
the project in general and so that was

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,740
the background and say okay so if these

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,550
are strengths how how do we deal with

00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:18,649
that how do we map these strengths to

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:20,450
you know two people that might be

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:23,440
interested in those then on the

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:27,800
distribution side we have tumbleweed

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,079
which is not really all that old in its

00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,350
current incarnation right if you look at

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:39,560
I mean tumble year tumbleweed this was

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:41,930
started by Greg kh3 four years ago 2011

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,510
yeah yeah I had it to peak at 2012 right

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,600
so so about four years ago and it was

00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:49,910
started as a semi rolling release which

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,649
basically said we're going to put new

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:57,769
stuff on top of a regular release and

00:11:54,649 --> 00:12:00,199
then when the next regular release comes

00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,820
we start over right so that was the

00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:05,959
basic premise of tumbleweed when it

00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:08,810
started by Greg cage and then after we

00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:10,370
went through the through the changes in

00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:13,579
the bill service with the staging

00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:15,949
projects and so on and open QA coming

00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,390
into play more and more we came to the

00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:19,490
conclusion that we can have a real

00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,920
rolling release that that is pretty

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:24,529
stable and works really well for many

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,440
people that of course provides value

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:30,560
software and we've seen yesterday in

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,620
Richards keynote you know how much how

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,290
many changes we process um you know we

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,750
go over week of course you know some

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,920
people think whatever one kernel change

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,690
and 150 package changes are quiet but

00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,779
you know we can certainly debate about

00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:49,550
that if we want / beer or two we even

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:52,279
managed to publish kindle fool last

00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:56,339
night all right cool whoa

00:12:52,279 --> 00:13:01,680
excellent I guess I need to run zipper

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:04,680
up this morning yeah and then of course

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,959
the the focus for tumbleweed is you get

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,820
the latest and greatest in a you know

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,240
reasonably well tested way through open

00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:15,029
QA as quickly as we possibly can manage

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,240
and the focus for that is certainly

00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:21,300
developers right while with open QA we

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,279
can assure that unlike in the old days

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,620
of factory you would update one day and

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,680
then yeah well your system wouldn't boot

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:30,839
or your graphics would disappear or

00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,430
other things would happen but tumbleweed

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,250
that doesn't really happen anymore and

00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:37,410
and so for developers that want the

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:44,040
latest and greatest stuff that is really

00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:45,779
cool right another strength is the is we

00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,880
believe our regular release and I think

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,620
the numbers for opensuse 13 to show that

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,230
and I think the feedback we got show

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,800
that as well people really like the

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,300
regular release in the past we've had

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:02,070
you know eight to twelve month release

00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:03,959
cycles primarily you know due to a

00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,149
couple of people working really

00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:12,300
diligently that that continues that way

00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:14,250
and we're very happy about that but it

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:16,470
is a decreasing interest to the

00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:18,829
development community because you know

00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,390
tumbleweed is is really so successful

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:23,279
but we do believe we have a loyal user

00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:30,079
base and I think the numbers one was at

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:34,529
13,000 130,000 I think they show that

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,690
yeah you'll probably notice over the the

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,339
event that there's a lot of emphasis on

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:41,459
tumbleweed and it's getting mentioned

00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:46,290
everywhere etc we're not detracting from

00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:49,110
the regular release it's just that due

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:52,290
to the the nature of the beast with

00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:55,500
tumbly moving so much faster more

00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:58,250
happening it's always going to be at the

00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,449
forefront and that's kind of the aim of

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,389
tumbleweed distribution is to be at the

00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:06,029
forefront the regular release is still

00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:10,620
important we understand that but it's

00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:13,970
trying to understand dynamics of the two

00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:17,550
and how they fit and work together yep

00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:19,050
and if you just end this basically the

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,509
slide you saw on Richards keynote

00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:26,970
yesterday this is come with tumbleweed

00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:30,959
usage and you can see the jump here are

00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:37,110
going up significantly in you know in in

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:38,970
the recent past so now of course as s

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:44,699
announced yesterday we we get thusly

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:47,399
sources and they're available in OBS and

00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,380
now you know for us it depends on what

00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,750
we as a community is a technical guys

00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,819
want to do with that and then the

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:57,779
discussion is going on on the mailing

00:15:53,819 --> 00:16:00,329
list I know there's issues sending email

00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:02,639
from here but you know just keep the

00:16:00,329 --> 00:16:05,880
thread and when you get back to a place

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:08,550
where you where you can send email I'll

00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,769
jump into the discussion it's important

00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,510
that everybody you know who contributes

00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:16,230
and uses opensuse really could

00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:18,480
participate in that discussion so that

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,240
you know those that end up building the

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,370
releases know where the community as a

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:27,269
whole wants to go with you know with

00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:29,069
this opportunity you know and there the

00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:31,380
possible as i said in one of my very

00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:34,040
first replies the possibilities with

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,889
this thing are endless my question is

00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:40,170
how are we go who is willing to do the

00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,660
work and and who's you know interested

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:46,139
in participating in either turning it

00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:47,670
this into a new release or into a

00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:50,250
release that may replace the current

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:52,500
opensuse release or you know we don't

00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:56,670
know right what one thing to bear in

00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:00,510
mind is that the board do not make the

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,420
decisions it's the community that made

00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,520
the decisions

00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:08,110
you can provide guidance provide

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:11,440
assistance we may disagree with you and

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,990
you may disagree with us that's fine but

00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:16,870
we will not we're not in a position to

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,330
say okay sousa released slee sources

00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,740
we're going to use that that's going to

00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:23,620
be the basis for the next regular

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,020
release that's not how it works you guys

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,360
need to provide your input your thoughts

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:33,940
your feelings I mean if we did use the

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:38,470
resources as the basis that will bring

00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:40,840
some issues into it as an example kernel

00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:44,860
versions will be different to what's in

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,990
13 2 so you look at colonel oh well why

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,690
am I getting an older colonel fool and

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:51,220
you were release it there's things like

00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:53,860
that but needs to be taken into account

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:59,710
it's not a straightforward decision

00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:01,600
which is why discussions open yeah I'm

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,090
that's definitely true but also there's

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,200
I think and also a lot of learning to go

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,250
into this because I mean I've been

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,810
looking at this for a little bit longer

00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,120
than everyone else has had a chance to

00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:13,540
and like with the kernel version example

00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,000
there's lots of stuff in Susie's Colonel

00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,770
the the kernel version would imply isn't

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,300
there but you know they have their needs

00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,830
of them enterprise customers so stuff

00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:24,340
gets back ported and shoved into there

00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:26,050
so you know it's now we can actually all

00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,330
see that and all figure out what's

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:30,160
actually there to work it sir yeah it's

00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,330
the chance to learn as well just about

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,620
just you know they'll just look at the

00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:36,340
version number and decay it's not going

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:39,820
to work it might work actually it should

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:42,670
work not so much Mike but it's on the

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:44,530
face of it if somebody finds that up ago

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,480
well why buy got an old colonel they

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,460
don't necessarily understand that yes

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,530
it's an older kernel version but it has

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:55,990
the same device drivers etc and I did

00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:58,600
okay anyway so we think you know that's

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:01,090
may appeal or may not appeal we'll see

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,730
where the discussion goes okay so from

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,770
there now we've listed our strengths as

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:08,650
a result of our tools and distribution

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:11,230
development okay so we think we offer

00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,480
you know a very broad selection with

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:15,250
over 8,000 packages

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,850
and you know many many more in the devel

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:22,030
projects so so basically this is what we

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:25,600
started out with in the in the board

00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:28,090
meeting here's the list the strength the

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,160
packages distribution and so on and then

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,610
we started mapping that to trying to

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,010
find a basically target audience for our

00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:38,620
marketing message that you know we

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,360
thought may be appropriate so we started

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,460
out with a list of those guys which is

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:45,760
you know independent software vendors or

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:47,830
you know software developers a you know

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,669
people that develop applications in

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:54,250
general then desktop users obviously

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:58,990
systems administrators and and you know

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:02,020
developers any kind of developer from

00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:04,990
there we came out ok so for ISVs we said

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:06,700
well those guys are often commercial

00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:09,700
they have commercial interests and as a

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:14,620
you know community distribution that is

00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:17,559
not really our primary target so we want

00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:20,080
to definitely you know maintain our

00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:22,480
community orientation and so that

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,490
doesn't really overlap well often with

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,620
the targets of an ISV who's interested

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,960
in you know obviously sustaining a

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,210
business in in supporting the software

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,919
and developing the software so we didn't

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:36,190
think it was a good overlap and so we

00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:39,490
kind of ruled out is v's as a as a

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:43,510
target audience so then we looked at the

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:47,260
desktop users and you can see we managed

00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:50,919
to you know map three three areas of our

00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,020
strength to desktop users you know the

00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:56,700
packages the distributions tumbleweed

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:59,470
and or regular releases and basically

00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:02,080
this is what we ended up with ok this is

00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:05,410
why we think we have the this certain

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,929
mapping one of our strengths is choice

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:10,419
right we are the Linux distribution that

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:13,179
has the most integrated test ops period

00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:17,440
okay you run opensuse you get to choose

00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:20,320
your desktop not we only give you one

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,409
and that's what you have to use know we

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,450
have the mostest up integrated desktop

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,600
environments and we

00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:32,380
that you know that should be of interest

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,970
to too many desktop users and also with

00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,330
the two distributions with the two

00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,429
approaches we can you know satisfy those

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,899
that you know want to move faster with

00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,860
tumbleweed and those that want to move

00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:46,960
slower with our regular booties so we

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,510
thought well that's abusers that could

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:55,149
be a really good target audience for a

00:21:49,510 --> 00:22:00,370
message but well we all know the orange

00:21:55,149 --> 00:22:04,500
distribution ok or brown or whatever

00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:08,320
color of the week is right and and

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:10,299
they're phenomenal PR machine and so

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,750
from that point of view that would be a

00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:16,120
really hard target for us to to get

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,919
through the messaging when we don't

00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:21,149
really have somebody that is willing to

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:25,659
shout out about opensuse at every event

00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:29,320
at every turn of the clock and say we

00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:31,029
are the PR machine for the geek oh so

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,330
well we don't have that and so we

00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:37,419
thought that would be very difficult to

00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:42,279
to work you know to work against I mean

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:44,799
yeah to work against and so generally we

00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:47,470
thought well desktop users are of course

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,779
important but they may not necessarily

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,029
turn into contributors and the

00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:54,639
competition there is really stiff so we

00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:56,470
kind of put that aside a little bit I

00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:59,049
mean in the end we all use the desktop

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:00,970
and so we obviously we can't discard it

00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:05,440
but you know it probably shouldn't be

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:07,600
our primary our primary audience so

00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,289
again should not be our primary focus

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,330
that's what what we came up with but of

00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:15,159
course we have the most integrated

00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:17,409
desktops and so that's a strength so

00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:20,200
somehow we we figured we need to use

00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:21,850
that and so we could put that aside a

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,100
little bit and we talked about the other

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:30,039
areas so systems administrators we also

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:32,080
have three arrows okay this time we

00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,610
figured that while sis admins are not

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,140
really going to be all that interested

00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:38,860
in having a distribution that

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:40,300
every day I assistant administrator kind

00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:43,300
of wants to turn on the system and

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,520
install security patches and that's

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:48,220
about it and not get a new kernel twice

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:51,310
a week or whatever except for a few

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,830
crazy guys some of them are standing up

00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:55,450
here but but in general a systems

00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:58,320
administrator is not going to be too

00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:04,510
interested in running tumbleweed right

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:08,350
yeah in general yeah and so if we look

00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:10,120
at this a little more closely you know

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,280
for systems administrators we have Yost

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,570
which is you know the best tool on the

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:20,590
planet to configure a Linux system OBS

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:23,230
and kiwi allow systems administrators

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:26,140
that our developer oriented to get their

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,670
hands dirty maybe build golden images or

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,660
things like that and so we think that's

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:33,400
really really cool and of course you

00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,430
know that the sharing of certain things

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:39,910
between opensuse and Souza may work in

00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:42,100
our favor in this case the regular

00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:46,660
release we believe strongly appeals to

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:50,260
to that audience recently Fodor has been

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:52,300
making a push to attract more systems

00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,280
administrators to their distribution and

00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:58,000
I think we think we would match up very

00:24:54,280 --> 00:25:00,460
well with fedora our regular releases

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,040
are slower we believe our regular

00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,230
releases are better and so I think we

00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:10,540
have a really good message there for

00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:13,720
systems administrator and we also think

00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,620
that sis admins have a tendency or more

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:21,760
of an affinity to turn into contributors

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:23,770
than desktop users for example and we

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,170
also think that the current push or move

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:31,510
towards DevOps for from traditional

00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:33,100
sysadmin also contributes tag to that so

00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:35,110
the conclusion here was that while

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,170
systems administrators have a strong

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:42,540
potential to be a focal audience for the

00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,540
opensuse marketing message okay

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,340
especially those that lean more towards

00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,950
development and DevOps are likely to

00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,659
find

00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:53,059
you know tools and things of interest

00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:56,960
within within the distribution and our

00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:58,880
project so then for developers yeh of

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,370
course now we have four arrows because

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,990
we match really well with with

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,870
developers at least that's what we think

00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:11,419
and of course we are free to disagree

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:14,360
but hey this is our show so ok so for

00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:17,179
developers we think opensuse is great

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:19,340
choice we have tumbleweed the most

00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:21,399
stable rolling release we believe were

00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:25,039
better than the other rolling releases

00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:27,919
because we have open QA and and we are

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,809
more stable on that front of course I

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,850
personally have also heard from other

00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:36,429
success well tumbleweed is now moving

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:40,309
too fast and it's like oh well too bad

00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:42,350
and then you know we have OBS that that

00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:45,889
allows developers and especially

00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:48,710
application developers to build packages

00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:50,740
for multiple distributions which is

00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:55,460
something that do not get in any other

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:57,799
service right and then once it's in

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:00,220
tumbleweed of course it goes out in in

00:26:57,799 --> 00:27:02,510
the regular release eventually and then

00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:06,919
developers get a you know has have a

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:09,200
broad target user base and developers

00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:10,850
naturally contribute you know turn into

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,980
contributors once they're in OBS and

00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:17,990
they get home so that's a very easy

00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:20,450
conversion Argentine too of course are

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,159
strong competitors in you know for the

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:25,340
rolling release but as I mentioned

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,919
tumbleweed rolls faster we believe it is

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:34,779
more stable thanks to open QA and

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,779
staging thanks different for posting

00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:44,290
um yet it was a pop-up so don't send

00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:51,280
anything to the list now will call you

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:53,890
out and so you know neither of the other

00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,140
rolling releases have a stable release

00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:59,920
to you know back up what goes into the

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:01,480
rolling release so the conclusion here

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,940
is you know the Vela purrs should

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,830
actually be a prime audience for the

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,830
opensuse message and for our project

00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:12,640
regardless of the type of development

00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,220
minus some dark corners right we're not

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,960
that good with the Java packages we

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,520
don't have a clips and you know but you

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:23,620
can't make everybody happy and that's

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:25,600
just perfectly fine so developers in

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,540
system administrators are also desktop

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,610
users and so therefore now we come back

00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,380
to the desktop that we pushed aside a

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:34,390
little earlier and say well the desktop

00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:37,690
is very important and we want to

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:40,150
certainly continue you know having the

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:43,060
most integrated desktops as a

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,220
distribution and you know to all of

00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:50,290
those that do the work the KDE team the

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:54,610
kinome team xfce Alex the Enlightenment

00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:56,260
and whoever else yeah thanks oh thank

00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,780
you so much for you know we know that's

00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:01,870
a lot of work because especially when

00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:04,660
the stuff underneath keeps changing over

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:07,720
and or so thanks for all of those it's

00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:10,420
been mentioned that well so nothing's

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,040
changed well that's what we said at the

00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:14,020
beginning we're not changing the focus

00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,050
of the project but what we are changing

00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:20,500
is actually making sure that we can

00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:22,870
highlight the focal message for the

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,480
project and that that was main reason

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:28,150
for the exercises going through where

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,820
can we try and make a concerted effort

00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:33,730
rather than scatter gunning everywhere

00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:38,860
and getting maybe one person here or

00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:40,790
nobody anywhere that's the identifying

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:46,850
who the target audiences

00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:49,000
yep and so after all of that and I'm

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:52,250
sure many of you saw the pictures of the

00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:57,080
board meeting online after all of that

00:29:52,250 --> 00:30:04,250
and a few of those we came up with this

00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:09,140
a tagline for a project and an idea well

00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:11,420
oiled by opensuse beer and the exercise

00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,730
we went through and so we thought well

00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:16,250
mole percent is here and see how what

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:20,120
you guys saw everybody thinks basically

00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:22,700
opensuse as the makers choice that is

00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,950
the you know the idea of a tagline for

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,800
the project that should help us to focus

00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:31,580
our message to the outside world about

00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:33,890
who we are as a project and what we want

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:36,920
to do and the target audience that we

00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:39,050
want to receive that we want to be the

00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,910
receiver of that message and so

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:42,800
hopefully over the next couple of days

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,730
well you know we're all still here we

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:48,830
can all discuss this along with the

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:50,060
resources so we have you know that we

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,570
have certainly plenty of stuff to

00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:55,640
discuss also tonight at the party and if

00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,610
you're a little shy then maybe after a

00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:02,000
couple of beers tonight you know we can

00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,920
have some good discussions all right so

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,950
where does this all go obviously now

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,810
while we have a wonderful tagline

00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,200
potentially if you know people agree

00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:15,290
then we have to do something with it and

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,030
here we are so our job here is you know

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,940
sharing the vision that's what we're

00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:22,760
doing here this this this is our idea

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:25,400
and as Andrew said earlier we certainly

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,470
are not the ones to say well this is

00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,030
what we figured out you have to do it

00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:31,250
now that you know that's not how it

00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:34,700
works right we can only present the idea

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:38,060
and and hope that we you know generate

00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,060
excitement from from this that we can

00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:46,040
come on guys look alive we know it's

00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:47,960
early whoo and and now we have to just

00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,530
do it okay the first step of that is

00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,240
that we're going to

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:57,150
that there's work going on of replacing

00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:59,700
opensuse our org website with a new with

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:03,120
a new face that already started during

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,610
hack week basically that's just you know

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,310
the design and we hope that with this

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:12,000
focused marketing message that will

00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:14,730
produce the content for this fancy shiny

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:20,180
new design I don't think we have any

00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:20,180
mock-up pictures do we ok

00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,839
go go

00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:51,450
hey we're winging it what could possibly

00:32:43,920 --> 00:33:01,380
go wrong right here our new and improved

00:32:51,450 --> 00:33:27,360
website welcome to the 90s we're getting

00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:28,500
their work here it is now come on yeah

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,900
see you've got the two the two

00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:35,700
distributions tumbleweed and of course

00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:41,060
opensuse and if we scroll down we have

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,060
car mock up with all of our tools and

00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,540
this is all a mock-up so I'm not

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:48,120
clicking on anything because I don't

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:50,670
know where it's going to take me but

00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,430
they've also this is all thanks to

00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,200
Cynthia and Donna I'm doing the design

00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,670
for this thing started on hack week and

00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,390
they're now working on it when they get

00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:05,120
some time as well and they've also made

00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:08,990
it responsive so if you're a mobile user

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,990
you have a screen bigger than that

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:28,710
what's wrong with your machine this is

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:31,750
worked fine before how did you hear that

00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:39,540
all right my tumbleweed machine works

00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:44,590
fine well this is not Jenna with Andrew

00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:47,200
all right somebody there we go serveur

00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,750
in the network yeah if you're on a

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:54,910
mobile device it looks something like

00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:58,000
this so yeah really just want to get the

00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:59,890
idea of having this reflect you know the

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,870
yeah we do our distributions we do our

00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:04,180
tools the top he would give up at the

00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:05,440
top or and the menu here are going to

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,570
have links to all the various parts of

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,380
the community stuff the forms obviously

00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:13,510
the wiki the download pages and yeah

00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,920
really try and sort of have that reflect

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:21,930
the kind of thing that we're talking

00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:21,930
about here today alright cool so

00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:33,530
back to our static picture there you go

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:33,530
that's fine okay

00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:42,530
and we're almost at the end anyway right

00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:44,839
so you would go one more okay so we just

00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,900
saw that which is really cool I'm

00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:51,619
excited and so please take the plunge

00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:54,920
right as we said we're you know we can't

00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:57,290
direct we can only suggest that's half

00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,040
the discussions we also have the live

00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:03,920
project meeting on Monday morning after

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,599
party number two so we know that's going

00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,200
to be difficult but we're hoping that

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,359
the project meeting we can get your

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,800
engines rolling so you might start a bit

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,369
later than becoming we have a schedule

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,790
yeah we'll see how the how the beer

00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:22,880
supply holds up or disappears alright

00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:25,579
and so with that I'm talking about the

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:32,869
beer supply there is a party tonight

00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:34,220
whoo now I'm not gonna say it also the

00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:36,290
party Marcus mentioned that there's

00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:40,060
going to be a big birthday party for the

00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:42,680
project we turned ten this year

00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:45,440
fortunately we're not going to have the

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,290
big birthday party this year we will

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,940
however have it next year in Nuremberg

00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:56,390
osc 16 there will be balloons hopefully

00:36:52,940 --> 00:37:07,160
maybe some streamers may even have a

00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:08,900
clown so no comment yeah so I hopefully

00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:13,910
will see you all there next year as well

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:15,619
for the big bash let's start the

00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:19,599
conversation about the new marketing

00:37:15,619 --> 00:37:22,579
message hopefully we can you know get

00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,329
right there and we're certainly if you

00:37:22,579 --> 00:37:28,369
want to have a discussion now Andrews

00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:33,250
already breaking is so maybe you should

00:37:28,369 --> 00:37:40,520
have one of those to start the day well

00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:45,710
I am NOT that enthusiastic I think

00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:50,150
on this is a bit narrow minded sorry we

00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:56,300
have to ask us where we are going to

00:37:50,150 --> 00:38:00,560
find new users nowaday everybody have a

00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:07,220
computer everybody have an operating

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:10,370
system so we only can get new user and

00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:15,220
new contributors against other operating

00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:19,820
systems the underwater I have seen now

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:27,020
we are only seeking against other Linux

00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:30,290
distributions the only developers we can

00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:33,740
attract are the one that actually works

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:37,330
for other distributions we won't attract

00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:42,140
in a windows developer I don't think so

00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:47,270
so I think we we need to ask us where

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:52,450
can we found the users and think we only

00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:58,250
can find new user on the general

00:38:52,450 --> 00:39:03,280
computer users maybe we won't have many

00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:09,860
contributors among them but it's some

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:19,700
with among millions of users may be

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:23,240
better than many in a very small yeah

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:27,850
sorry i am not as fluent in english as i

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:31,130
would be good come in small community

00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:33,800
developers are a small communities even

00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:38,210
if we take them a scent of developers it

00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:45,070
will be much less than 1000 / most users

00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:48,260
I see only place where you may found

00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:51,300
very interesting new user it's schools

00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:53,610
universities the

00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:58,530
new people that is learning that are

00:39:53,610 --> 00:40:01,590
possessing now this should be a strong

00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:09,450
focus because there we can get really

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:13,170
new people but there's something attacks

00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:18,860
on the pencils it is in the website

00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:24,480
definitions it's liners we do not want

00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:29,370
to start a new distribution wha we all

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:32,550
are lineart first I like much better

00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:37,890
number to user than the window user you

00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:42,600
know if I fail to install a pencil I can

00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:46,620
install any one too it's okay i prefer

00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:49,140
pencil of course but if the people want

00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:52,530
to have one too i am okay with it but if

00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:58,740
you want to install a window 8.1 i am

00:40:52,530 --> 00:41:03,870
not true so you know we have to focus to

00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:07,950
really new users somewhere and last

00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:11,820
we're on the beginning somebody asks for

00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:15,090
non-technical contributors you won't

00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:18,540
find them in all the developers and we

00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:21,570
can find them in the general desktop

00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,510
users time so I'm going to have to keep

00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:27,900
my response really short we can talk

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:32,940
about it more later but i would ask the

00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:35,640
question of what is the benefit of

00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,520
having more users if they aren't also

00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:40,110
becoming new contributors and that's

00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,700
kind of where we kind of came from a lot

00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:44,070
of this is we want to focus on those

00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,720
users that we can get that can then help

00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,190
us become better community come

00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,550
contributors and then can help to the

00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:51,750
project unit forward and faster so you

00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,080
know obviously if we end up building

00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,080
something

00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,910
everybody's in user at some time

00:41:56,470 --> 00:42:01,780
everybody was a Windows user at some

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:03,190
time and the Windows Linux environments

00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,810
that kind of you know are changing quite

00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:08,080
significantly I mean you can run docker

00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,720
images on Windows now so I i think the

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:13,030
the sort of old-fashioned binary way of

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,310
looking at it is a little bit trickier

00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,660
and we think a vision like this if

00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:19,780
actually targeting people who want to

00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,950
build something will appeal to the kind

00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,780
of people we want to get involved in the

00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:25,960
project so they can help us build our

00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:28,660
project better yeah I would also say

00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:31,180
that this thing the makers choice would

00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:36,100
also cover the University guys that are

00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:39,340
making research or data mining or

00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:41,080
whatever and also one thing that we when

00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:43,510
we were looking at the desktop users

00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:47,140
they are pretty conservative and they

00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:49,870
don't really care what they have they

00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,090
basically get their hardware with

00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:56,110
something no matter what it is and they

00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:58,120
use it and they use it to the till it

00:42:56,110 --> 00:43:01,680
breaks and then they throw a way to

00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:05,470
computer and get a new one so there is a

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,150
it's a hard target target them and arts

00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:11,830
to convince them to switch to something

00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:13,960
else and we think that are the people

00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:16,930
that actually do stuff I'm more

00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:19,450
interesting and we can convert them from

00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,820
windows as well if you try to do

00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:24,580
something on Windows you know it's hard

00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:26,890
to do something we're really starting to

00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,500
encroach on the next speakers time who

00:43:26,890 --> 00:43:31,840
is also busy after that so I think we

00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,640
should pick up here on Monday in the

00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,830
life project meeting i think this we're

00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,080
really good discussion to have on monday

00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,910
so thanks everyone for coming enjoy the

00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,350
rest of the day and don't forget the

00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,350
