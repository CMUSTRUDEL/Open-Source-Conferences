Title: OSC15 - Adrian Schr√∂ter - What's new in OBS
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	A team report how the Open Build Service(OBS) team sees the current state of OBS in openSUSE. It will also outline our goals for this year. The talk is a good opportunity to sync the point of view between OBS developers and users. We are happy to discuss any issues our goals afterwards.

OBS is the central infrastructure behind the openSUSE distribution. It is used to build, collaborate and to maintain the openSUSE distribution. Also many others are using build.opensuse.org to build open source software for SUSE and many non-SUSE distributions. Learn more about OBS at http://www.openbuildservice.org
