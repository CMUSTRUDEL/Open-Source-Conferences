Title: OSC15 - Robert Schweikert - Booth boxes
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The first round of booth box material has been distributed around the world with our last supply used during FOSDEM earlier this year. More booth box material is on teh way and we will be ready for the rest of the year to ship material where it is needed.

There is an application to request a booth box for a given event.

There will be an initial presentation about how we got to where we are today. After this the conversation should focus on improving the existing implementation of the process and the material. With the second round of material on order the results of the discussion will not be immediately visible but will certainly influence the direction of future orders. There is also a need for more coordination and bookkeeping that we will discuss during the session, hopefully a volunteer can be found.
