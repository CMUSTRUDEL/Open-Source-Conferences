Title: OSC15 - Robert Schweikert - Booth boxes
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	The first round of booth box material has been distributed around the world with our last supply used during FOSDEM earlier this year. More booth box material is on teh way and we will be ready for the rest of the year to ship material where it is needed.

There is an application to request a booth box for a given event.

There will be an initial presentation about how we got to where we are today. After this the conversation should focus on improving the existing implementation of the process and the material. With the second round of material on order the results of the discussion will not be immediately visible but will certainly influence the direction of future orders. There is also a need for more coordination and bookkeeping that we will discuss during the session, hopefully a volunteer can be found.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,760
let's go um good morning so I was hoping

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,580
for more participation but I guess if

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,839
you don't have dr. in your talk then the

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,670
room doesn't get full so the idea today

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,279
was really to have a more interactive

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,050
session to talk about what we have and

00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,869
where we should go with the booth boxes

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,529
I'm going to start out with a very brief

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:31,439
history of where we were what we had in

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,300
between and where we are today and then

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,520
hopefully we can come up with some ideas

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,780
to to improve what we have today okay so

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,510
a brief history where we are now and

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,250
what we need to do basically you know

00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,000
get some feedback and see what people

00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:57,329
think okay so brief history a long time

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,579
ago we had a la carte marketing material

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,890
meaning basically we had a website and

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,750
somebody could go there and say please

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,200
ship me 200 dvds because i'm going to an

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,510
event and i want to represent opensuse

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,490
that was pretty much the only thing that

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:17,640
we had that was organized and then we

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,380
had ad hoc other materials sometimes

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,250
there were stickers and sometimes they

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,960
were t-shirts and sometimes was nothing

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,860
but nothing of that was really organized

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,650
and everything was kind of back channels

00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:34,590
and stuff was there or it wasn't so that

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,400
was was difficult but DVDs we had

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,720
consistently right but anything else

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:46,530
people were kind of on their own then at

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,060
some point everything was stopped and it

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,930
was decided that we needed a new

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,560
approach during that time the idea of

00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:58,290
the booth boxes was born and we and

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,329
eventually ended up with what we have

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:06,270
today to booth boxes in some kind of

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:08,099
shape or form so in general obviously I

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,700
think we are much better off today with

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:11,650
the material that we have

00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:15,040
then we were previously because there

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,069
was no consistent material however not

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,940
having anything for a while did kind of

00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:24,489
put a prod end in the project so where

00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,160
we are today and as I said this is going

00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:31,450
to be very very quick so where we are

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:35,769
today is there's an app for that so we

00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:38,530
have an application where contributors

00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:42,190
can request a booth box they have to

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:43,870
tell us about the event and what they're

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:48,489
going to do there when when they get

00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,489
there when to get the booth box we have

00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:56,079
basically two sizes of booth boxes small

00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:58,780
events and larger events and a large

00:02:56,079 --> 00:03:03,700
event is basically the same but a small

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:07,030
booth box doubled and so this is really

00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,370
a one size fits all the content is

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,500
predetermined so whatever is in a booth

00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:15,459
box we have decided what goes in it and

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,769
that's what we ship out and it is

00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,410
refreshed when we run out okay so the

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:24,130
first the first round of booth boxes

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:25,959
that was ordered more than a year ago we

00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,750
used everything up and then there was a

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,959
refresh cycle some of the stuff we

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,819
reordered other things were changed if

00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,799
you've been to the opensuse table you

00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:39,010
see we have this nice new booklet that's

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,730
really cool previously that was just a

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,260
one sheet flyer with the zipper cheat

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,079
sheet on the back or something like that

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,150
and so now it has more information it's

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:50,950
hopefully a better conversation starter

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,900
and so that's some of the refresh that

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,709
happens when we're out of material when

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,540
we do new stuff however and we of course

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:02,799
we have the local reimbursement program

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:06,400
so that was also reinstated just about a

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,910
year ago or so and if you're interested

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,680
in making Flyers locally or you

00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:13,480
translate some of the material that's in

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,090
the booth box and you want to print that

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,190
out that's what the local material local

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,890
reimbursement is for so when it's a

00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,940
small event or for making posters or

00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:26,190
things like that

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,050
just request the money and and and have

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,450
your bill send it in you get your money

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,670
back hang up your posters or whatever

00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:34,650
you're doing so the local reimbursement

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,290
is really for you know small events

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:41,820
whereas a booth box would be way too

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:43,950
much okay and so so that's running and

00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,170
it's being used for a few things but

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,510
there's certainly room more people can

00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:53,310
use it right so what we're not getting

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:56,160
so much is feedback so we don't really

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:58,050
know all that well what works and what

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,290
doesn't work and so we need more

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:04,110
feedback to be able to better adjust the

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,200
content the next time around we create

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,330
new material okay so what is working

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,360
right what is working from a booth box

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,190
perspective we don't necessarily hear

00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,230
that feedback and working in this case

00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:19,200
means what is a good conversation

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,060
starter right if I give a million if I

00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,150
lay out a million pens when i run a

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,060
booth at a show they're all going to be

00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:28,860
gone right but that's that doesn't mean

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,870
it's working right it just means that

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,260
people walk by the table and they grab a

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,440
pen working is you start a conversation

00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,020
and you can engage somebody to make them

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,870
interested in opensuse just by handing

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,970
out a pen yes then somebody else sees

00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,800
that they went to the opensuse booth and

00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,450
they got a pen but that doesn't make

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,450
them talk about the project or the

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,430
distribution or whatever we do right we

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,100
want to start a conversation so what is

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,440
working is it working if I hand somebody

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,780
a DVD and say here go try that it said

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,310
to go to conversation starter you know

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,560
we don't know so that's something we

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:09,080
need feedback from for from the people

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,670
that actually go and do the events and

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,100
then another thing of course is is it

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:16,260
worth spending time at that same event

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,580
again the year after right that's always

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,610
something we have to think about when

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,980
you go to an event and the event website

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,320
says oh they're going to be 500 people

00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:29,280
and then you go there and there's 50

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:31,380
showing up well maybe maybe that's not

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,640
worth going to again next year I you

00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,860
know I don't know but the person that

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,299
goes has to make that determination to

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:38,339
see

00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:40,289
er4 actually started conversations if we

00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:47,009
had conversations about the project and

00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:48,509
about opensuse one and so this is

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,699
basically all that I had for a

00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,829
presentation right so this this is the

00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,529
outline and then from here we can you

00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:58,079
know we can talk about do we need dvds

00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:01,349
okay so for example for this time around

00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:04,769
for open source of 13 to there was no

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:06,989
plan for us to make dvds and then a

00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:09,029
sponsor showed up and said here will

00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:11,639
ship you for you so i was a few thousand

00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,339
dvds and you can hand them out and that

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,929
was fantastic right it says something we

00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,729
want to you know try and keep in the

00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,709
future do we want to approach the

00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:21,719
sponsor again and say you know for the

00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:24,689
next release do you want to give us some

00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:26,369
dvds or you know do people not want them

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:31,860
i mean that's feedback that we need

00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:33,989
right do we need limited material

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,689
selection options right so maybe instead

00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:39,959
of having one size fits all the

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:43,409
application where you order where you

00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:45,959
ask for the booth box could have for

00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:48,959
this event I need more of this unless of

00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:52,049
that you know so basic somewhat a la

00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:55,829
carte selection for your event so that

00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:58,259
you know that's a question do does stuff

00:07:55,829 --> 00:08:00,829
need to be localized do you do the

00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,239
people that are interested in that half

00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:06,299
people that are willing to translate the

00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:09,269
English literature into the local

00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:11,039
language and then how would you know

00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,049
what would that look like so those are

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,959
so those so those are some discussion

00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:18,329
starters I'm really finished because you

00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,099
know I was hoping that we have more of a

00:08:18,329 --> 00:08:23,309
group to have an interactive discussion

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:25,769
but it's there only four of you and one

00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:29,419
of me I don't know but if you have

00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:29,419
opinions please let's talk about it

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:52,150
I was just wondering if for example in

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:55,300
situations of pains or how is a no-no

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:57,710
conversation starter how about some

00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,230
transitive effects like when you give

00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:02,570
someone a pen he tooks it to his office

00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,839
or friends and someone there asked about

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:08,810
it so if you are wondering about that

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,310
too some some delayed conversation

00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:16,370
starters I would say right and and and

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,830
like a pen could could do that right or

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,750
I mean now we have used beastx or

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,600
whatever yes they could be that delayed

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:27,200
conversation starter however I think if

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,680
you just if they take something and you

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,570
don't talk to them right in there and

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,160
then they go back to the office or where

00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,720
else and then they get asked about it

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,430
and they don't really have anything to

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,520
say right because they picked up no

00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:43,520
information they picked up something

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:45,920
right and and so I think it is important

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,900
to have those conversation starters when

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,160
you know have an interaction when you're

00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,160
representing a project

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:06,149
that's fine actually we do this seems

00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:09,230
locally in China a in one way we put

00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:13,320
that would compose the sums away our

00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:15,630
booze and get some feedback from the

00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,540
attendees that's true reason the first

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:20,459
one is in China if we have the

00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,350
conference a lot of people there you

00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:24,630
don't have too much time talk to each of

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:28,170
the guys who take a pen that's a reason

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:31,140
the other one is if I were standing

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:33,329
boost and talk with the people just I

00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,370
got the feedback if I didn't talk to you

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:38,640
all the other people nobody knows what

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,620
we talk so we intend the tools that have

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,540
some questions and don't get more

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:54,120
feedback then give him or her a pen

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:56,269
