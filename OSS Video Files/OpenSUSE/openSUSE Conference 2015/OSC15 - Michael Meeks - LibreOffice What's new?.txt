Title: OSC15 - Michael Meeks - LibreOffice What's new?
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	In the last six months LibreOffice has launched on a host of new
platforms making it available more widely than ever before. Come and see
demos of the brand new Android editor prototype, the just-announced
LibreOffice Online, and hear what major under-the-hood changes are
making these new apps possible. Not a pixel-pusher? Be introduced to
LibreOfficeKit -- the lean, mean, API-accessible machine that's just
been revamped for mobile deployment.

Michael explains where LibreOffice is heading as our thousand-strong
community charters unknown waters (and devices), and how you can be part
of the world's most popular productivity suite serving over 80 million
users. In short: come along, get involved, and participate in what may
be the most "productive" Free Software project on earth.
