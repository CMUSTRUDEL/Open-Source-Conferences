Title: OSC15 - Michael Meeks - LibreOffice What's new?
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	In the last six months LibreOffice has launched on a host of new
platforms making it available more widely than ever before. Come and see
demos of the brand new Android editor prototype, the just-announced
LibreOffice Online, and hear what major under-the-hood changes are
making these new apps possible. Not a pixel-pusher? Be introduced to
LibreOfficeKit -- the lean, mean, API-accessible machine that's just
been revamped for mobile deployment.

Michael explains where LibreOffice is heading as our thousand-strong
community charters unknown waters (and devices), and how you can be part
of the world's most popular productivity suite serving over 80 million
users. In short: come along, get involved, and participate in what may
be the most "productive" Free Software project on earth.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
see this is what I'm going to say and

00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,540
we're gonna rush through it so if you

00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:08,280
want a heckle in a compressor and you

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,530
know ask for more so it's going to be

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,389
fun so get out of the way so libre

00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,070
office continues to do really well we're

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:18,840
very blessed with lots and lots of users

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,789
who last year I was here and I said we

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,340
had something like 65 million unique IP

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,570
addresses registered looking for update

00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,310
super coming you now we've got a hundred

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,410
and twenty million this is the kind of

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,330
group I like in a year let's see what

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,250
happens next year huh and most of that

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,020
so coarse the windows we can't really

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,760
measure the Linux success you can't see

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,329
the successor opensuse in our staff to

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,129
the shape we're pressed about that maybe

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:43,379
you can turn on your update CIA you know

00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:45,010
your own stats but when we do so that's

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,680
just pretty much windows

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,080
those commits

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,530
what they're doing quite well so the the

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,150
tickle commits of the year we look at

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,910
sue scissor of course find a great chunk

00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,850
out they spun it out collabera

00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,800
productivity to a degree we didn't get

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,239
everyone a shame but we got quite a lot

00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,729
so you see the growth from the green

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,430
screen here is labral productivity

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:12,830
taking up the slack verb Sousa of course

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,830
volunteers is this great big blue tongue

00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:17,570
join the project since we started and

00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,570
then Red Hat doing a huge chunk of work

00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,120
too

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,690
and committed slaton committers per

00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,690
month yes

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,829
see 4.4 are we released six months ago

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,420
in a year so i can either you to point

00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:37,220
out the things that we've done that so

00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,229
the first thing is cleaning the UI so

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,479
the UI our toolkit is just terrible it's

00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,450
still pretty interesting and still kids

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,890
go but it has the benefit working which

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,689
is nice and it works cross-platform

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:50,060
pretty well and you can render the clear

00:01:47,689 --> 00:01:52,220
maps for android and service

00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,100
that's pretty nice suit but there's just

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,290
so much of it you know million

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,300
millions of lines of code and the

00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:03,219
people finally finish problem all

00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,219
actually

00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:06,219
layouts

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,299
crim something else we've done is look

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,250
at performance this just an example of

00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,890
that serum it turns out the looting

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,560
sheets leading large XML files is pretty

00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,799
nasty parsing XML is pretty slow

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,409
horrible and you know when you have a

00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:27,239
huge file in excellency 50 megabytes

00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:29,270
uncompressed actually part of all that

00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:31,430
XML really takes significant time

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,610
so what we've done interesting Leah so

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:37,070
we split split are pausing in several

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:39,650
ways if the large xlsx seeds now we not

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,100
any party sheet in parallel is a pretty

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,260
nice thing to do

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,600
we actually split our XML parsing and

00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,790
second izing and unzipping into one fret

00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,500
and actually using those elements in

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,940
another and this is a really nice

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,460
technique because actually works for any

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,320
sax parser like if other ppl sax parser

00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,820
should be doing this there's no reason

00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:01,130
why you can't pause your XML and do all

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,960
of that ridiculous namespace handling

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,860
deduplication of

00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:07,270
elements on checking stuffs correct he

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,760
in one thread and then just admit those

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,879
events in the other and

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,379
interestingly you would think that

00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,640
pausing formulae and shoving formula

00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,129
into the spreadsheet and so on we'll

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,709
take a significant time but actually for

00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,930
dominating time leading a sheet is still

00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:25,299
a bit on the left the unzipping the

00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,099
passing an XML parsing and so can I

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:28,750
think and all those might follow the

00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,519
dominant piece of the XML parsing the

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,269
group which is slightly embarrassing

00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,260
really for a powerful man big thick neck

00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,519
so this is a very interesting approach

00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,930
it's pretty interesting because our

00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,049
competitors who shall remain nameless

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,810
about very large company they have some

00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,810
kind of hand coded precompiled schema

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:49,980
generated custom plaza you know that is

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,980
50 are wonderful and

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,330
it's extremely complicated large

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,330
engineering effort and it's slower

00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,989
im sue degree well uh performance wise

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:03,700
there lots of breads and compiling the

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,700
GPU in parallel in theory

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:11,190
but yeah the progress bar so you cling

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,500
to to improve performance this is just

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,489
one example or a lot so you need

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,620
separate things getting on the

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,250
spreadsheet

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:21,019
speed it up the public with Bob Baker

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,480
another things pretty nice is this is

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:26,600
COLLADA file so you know colada is I

00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:28,940
guess a 3d image format so you can

00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,770
represent your power station you know

00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,840
that your CAD systems developed you can

00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,910
get a walk through it and see see what's

00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,050
going on or you can represent i dinnae

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,780
Oh a three character in a movie

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,820
something like that or duck like this

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,860
and you can drop that into your sheet

00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,830
and have a model you can interact with

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,900
in 3d so in a walk through path date and

00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,610
see what's going on and to me one of the

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,740
encouraging things is the canonical form

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,960
is actually a zip file the whole live XM

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,750
element

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,220
maybe that is encouraging I don't get it

00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:59,169
follow my leader he gets there

00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,970
eventually dumb so this is actually a

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:03,520
rendered version of a cutie ltf which is

00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:07,740
kind of some kind of portal API dump goo

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,740
GL renting methods book

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,090
what else Montana suit approximately a

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,830
year ago we launched the doctrine

00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:17,630
liberation project the document

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,550
foundation is inferior container for

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:22,160
lots of cool projects and we try and

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:24,200
jealously guard our focus so that you

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,910
need to I'm document liberation is one

00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,210
of these started by these Friedrich

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,280
strauber

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,590
and Alex will evolve and David on the

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,300
rep amazon

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,580
Commission here is basically to unwind

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,300
increasing numbers of lame binary

00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,780
formats

00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,610
welcome to ATF so I mean the Sundering

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,580
successes they're busy okey no publisher

00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,690
works robert wall pagemaker um the list

00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,120
goes on I can't remember though you

00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,500
wouldn't believe how many lame formats

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,449
that are out there you know if you

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,909
actually go looking for them almost

00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,319
every office package has been you know

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:56,550
significantly reduced since its

00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:58,680
beginnings if you look at how the market

00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,870
consolidated around the current lead

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,669
vendor it destroyed whole loads of

00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,289
things in doing that and but there's

00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:06,300
still lots of files out there with those

00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:07,740
formats so it's quite some quite fun

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,719
work there and often they're quite quite

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,340
simple but some of them are quite quite

00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:13,319
importantly I meaning a page maker and

00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:15,960
some of these things being able to you

00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:18,090
know reproduce that on your in your

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:23,009
Lieber offices is really very useful as

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:24,360
a tool so that's all fun a 3d charting

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:25,979
so we've been trying to do some work and

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,780
this is an experimental feature to

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:30,300
improve a visualization of large data

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,770
sets so unfortunately in the spreadsheet

00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,629
world a large data set is thought to be

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,719
like a million items and which is a

00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:38,099
shame because that's not terribly large

00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:39,479
but either way I'm getting data

00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:41,069
streaming through the spreadsheet so you

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,259
can see it and having you know 60 frames

00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:44,509
a second live charting on it is it

00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,580
something something pretty nice and

00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:50,639
something you can't see here which is

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,380
using color so we can plot color using

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,169
formula so you can associate a formula

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:57,120
with your old files color and so you can

00:06:55,169 --> 00:06:59,550
do crazy stuff you know you can get that

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,740
pink to purple gradient you always

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:06,810
dreamed of and life is good right so a

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,129
writer ok so interoperability is

00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,190
something else we care a lot about and

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,690
for a long time for a long time this

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:16,259
problem was here that it's pretty

00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:18,000
irritating so when you read the open xml

00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,289
file format microsoft's a file format

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,870
you notice that there's commonality

00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:23,310
between the different projects so if you

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,990
stick one of these kind of shapes in

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,789
here with these funny sides or a you

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,039
know cloud shape here doesn't work very

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:31,500
well you'll find it's the same thing in

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:37,529
each of the file formats which is great

00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:38,729
for Excel Word and PowerPoint well

00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:40,680
problem is that you can't have the same

00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:42,810
content inside them so actually word

00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,770
puts totally different content inside so

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,110
for example you can have red lining

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,149
inside it but you can't actually do that

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,009
in Excel or in PowerPoint so if you

00:07:48,149 --> 00:07:51,240
actually copy and paste the same for

00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,779
around these different sweets you end up

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,740
with a very interesting situation and

00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:57,389
unfortunately we shared the code across

00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,279
all of our our components so you know

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,309
actually it was the same thing in every

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,719
case and yeah so we've sort of slightly

00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:05,849
retweet to that so that we can actually

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:07,830
not lose for example peoplesmart art but

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,839
they like to put in shapes and their red

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,550
lining and this sort of thing so that

00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,559
really really helps interoperability

00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,069
wise and cloud on cloud on Thunder that

00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:18,539
which is which is great what else ha an

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:21,180
Android viewer so that's pretty nice so

00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:24,930
in 44 based on 44 week we ship an

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,189
Android viewer and that works pretty

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,259
nicely for viewing I'll show you some

00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,669
more stuff for 5.0 which is which is

00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,399
later and I'll give you a little demo of

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:34,079
that now what else measuring your pc's

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,219
so your PC looks like this if your heat

00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:37,860
sinks are big enough you know it's like

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,819
a city and if your heat things up big

00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,229
enough you don't have a hot enough

00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:43,260
processor so you know talk to enter

00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:45,329
about that but PC ma basically measures

00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,829
the performance of PCs and one of the

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:48,720
ways the PCs are now measured is using

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:50,339
LibreOffice so it's great to see

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,329
libreoff is embedded in that that's

00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:54,269
something clever have been working with

00:08:51,329 --> 00:08:56,579
a pc mark on so it's really nice you

00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,319
have a nice well-defined thing that will

00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:00,240
calculate and you know do stuff and

00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:02,190
allow you to benchmark you know a real

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,660
world use case that you know hundred

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,120
million people are using out there and

00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,579
see you know how fast your CP is how

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,290
well it can cope with it another thing

00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:13,380
we've been doing is trying to stop

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,639
regressions so people um say to step

00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,050
back i was particularly encouraged the

00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,029
other day to see that the colonel the

00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,190
linux kernel which in my view has a

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,139
massive over resourcing problem you know

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,040
like there are too many people working

00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:25,139
on the links colonel they should be

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
working on opensuse and LibreOffice and

00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:28,709
these other things right you know

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,620
they're huge teams and lots of companies

00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:33,420
all around the place and they have 400

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,130
open regressions in the kernel bug bug

00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,680
tracker which is which is encouraging we

00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:40,019
have about 500 but so you know we've

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,690
with bigger and smaller at the same time

00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,130
so I don't know um either way we'll have

00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,329
stopped regressions getting in and so

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,100
one of the ways we're doing that is

00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:48,870
creating unit tests unfortunate from a

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,670
low base there were no unit tests when

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:53,579
libreoff is started and now we have

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,139
quite a lot which is good um but yeah so

00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:57,930
you know when you have 14,000 commits

00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,630
every six months it's easy for some of

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,819
them to cause the regression turns out

00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:03,840
but we want to stop that escaping so are

00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,520
we you know creating

00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,340
a couple of thousands actually is to two

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,940
thousand tests a year or so of which

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,260
collaborators adding most of those the

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,910
idea being that if a customer pays for a

00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,920
bugfix they don't want to pay again for

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,660
the same bug fix next year you know I

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,330
mean that would be a nice business model

00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,010
of course but you know it's not so

00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,450
convincing to the customer to buy so we

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,000
like to fix a bug and also make sure it

00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:26,910
doesn't come back which is pretty cool

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,550
listen are the fun things we're doing to

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,350
try and increase quality so we have a

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:33,570
large corpus of nasty documents

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:34,800
basically everything bugs illus so we

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,690
look at the KDE bugs at Logan I'm

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,760
bugzilla actually I think that we

00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:41,370
scraped the Susa bugzilla the Libre

00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,490
Office obviously Apache bugzilla and we

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,680
come up with a 65,000 corpus of problem

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,540
documents that previously called some

00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,360
crash or some problem or some rendering

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:52,890
issue and we then build our builds with

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,090
the most paranoid debugging assertions

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:58,290
we possibly can you know this is the

00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:01,350
hair trigger you're dead build and then

00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,520
we actually run these all through so for

00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,170
the load testing the number used to be

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,150
thousands that we got you know just

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,530
crashed on or fail with assertions and

00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,420
that's now zero which is good so we've

00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,890
got this numbers down for loading having

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,600
loaded them we then save each of those

00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,910
documents to every format we support so

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,670
we exercise all of our export logic as

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:19,680
heavily as we can and unfortunately now

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,380
still hundreds of issues there whether

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,120
assertions or in a real failures but

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,330
again the number coming significantly

00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,740
down over the last month's after we've

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,270
exported them if we can we try and

00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,700
validate the file format so obviously

00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,860
for legacy binary ones it's harder um

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,570
but for xml ones and so on we can run

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,680
schema validators and things over them

00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,350
to make sure we've got it really right

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,640
um and then of course we also run that

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,380
under a San or you'll be sound

00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,610
occasionally we run under valgrind to

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,490
make sure that we're not shooting

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,600
ourselves in the foot in some way and

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,980
yeah thnkx two words I guess quail

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,340
mcnemar is getting a lot of the fixing

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:54,720
marcus as well collabera who sets thing

00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:56,880
up and got it running and the docking

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,760
foundation donors so we have something

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,620
like sixty five thousand donors last

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,460
year giving ten euros each something

00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:07,930
like that much appreciated they funded

00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:10,510
some kind of 64 piece cpu

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:13,660
to get by something rather beast that

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,420
runs all this stuff in about a day when

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:18,160
it used to take about a week so so we

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,110
can start to see and track master and

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,880
make sure that you know when something

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,620
breaks something we can see reasonably

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,690
accurately what it's like to be that's

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,920
pretty cool other things are doing its

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,970
performance testing so we're very

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,500
irritated when we get performance

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,220
regressions and when they escaped into

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,540
the public so we we actually run

00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,010
performance profiling so the traditional

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,800
approach to performance profiling is

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:39,970
terrible which is to run the thing lots

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,010
and lots lots of times and take an

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,839
average and this produces terrible

00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,010
results they jitter horribly and you

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,380
can't get anything out of it even with

00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,500
20 runs on modern hardware is so

00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:53,589
non-deterministic due to thermal and

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,120
random stuff that you just don't get

00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:56,860
good numbers I'm so we're running all

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,290
under valgrind or cash grind effect and

00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,990
that gives us really hard numbers you

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,390
can see a point five percent change like

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,399
a step with that Darin so you can

00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,899
isolate it to an individual commit and

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,890
help improve that doesn't show you

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,360
everything of course doesn't show you

00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,830
threading so if we thread something

00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,540
sometimes it it looks like it's gets

00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,339
slower because cash grant doesn't thread

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,770
but actually got quicker which is

00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:19,930
amusing we've put some pretty serious

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,390
progressions there are we know how

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:24,070
continuous integration so Norbert a fee

00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:25,480
board who's a great volunteer on the

00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,520
board has been doing some good work

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,709
there and yeah there's just sort of

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:31,600
catching breakage before it goes in our

00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,690
comparative score is now almost exactly

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,130
zero I mean it's a rounding error which

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,589
is amazing there's no other open source

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,790
project out there with a Coverity scores

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:41,580
Louis arts so there you are there's a

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,100
challenge Jhene for the it's a

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:46,870
recidivist others to improve um so you

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,940
see a lot of focus on quality trying to

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,410
get it up and improve it I think you

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:51,850
know we need the quality to be at a

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,529
baseline that people actually believe

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,529
the filing bugs is worthwhile and that

00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:57,459
you know people fix stuff so other

00:13:56,529 --> 00:13:59,079
things we done to improve the user

00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:00,700
interface three years we have this

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:02,350
wonderful feature where if you'd load a

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,790
read-only document it does something

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,740
very odd to your toolbar and there's a

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,209
very hard to understand button you can't

00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,160
find you can click so you can edit a

00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,170
document that's pretty irritating and so

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,910
now we have this nice little bar that

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,220
saves a lot of lot of hassle and you

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:16,839
click edit documents I'm making the

00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,459
feeling better I don't know if you saw

00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,079
you know so we have this toolbar theming

00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,290
thing but few people knew about it

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,329
hidden away so

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,070
we made a nice of browser for that to

00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:27,230
make it prettier interesting you saw

00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:28,970
this in office 2013 after we'd shift at

00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:33,350
the same same thing in the competition

00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:35,570
or something still are only how so just

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:38,870
prettier staff better color selections

00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,690
better palate management better change

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,430
change tracking so now a usually profits

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:46,100
every day intensively you notice the

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:49,040
change tracking problem and yeah so

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:52,220
urine AJ did a whole lot a lot of work

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,199
here and Samuel as well which will

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:59,060
improve on in 5.0 see 5.0 is our next

00:14:54,199 --> 00:15:00,709
release coming in june and yeah improved

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,690
interoperability again of course

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,300
something we love to keep improving

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,970
prettier formatting types and so on so

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,519
again and interoperability a pivot table

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:13,160
rendering so improving how up to the

00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:15,920
tables are laid out again in improving

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,959
interoperability PDF signing so now we

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,600
can sign and timestamp PDF so you can be

00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:22,639
sure that actually this PDF was really a

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,829
signed by someone and on that date and

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,889
which is quite important feature crowd

00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:31,519
funded by vilhelm tucks which is much

00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:33,800
appreciated yeah random random new staff

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,120
color palette importing bits and just

00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,829
lots of features i can only give you a

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,810
flavor of some of the stuff here you

00:15:36,829 --> 00:15:41,990
know there's just not enough time ready

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:43,250
to you to do more so one of the funny

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:45,889
things is that for john paul microsoft

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,949
don't write a valid open xml themselves

00:15:45,889 --> 00:15:50,209
in office 2007 and so we've had to add a

00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,430
whole load of infrastructure say yes

00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:54,680
it's in maybe a docx run XO excess but

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,149
is it the one where the defaults are

00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,769
different you know so if the attribute

00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,600
is missing it has a different default

00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:01,420
value in different versions of microsoft

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,069
office which is particularly irritating

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:07,370
so anyway there's some degree of hackery

00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:09,410
going on there yeah being able to

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,430
navigate your sheet in calc it's been

00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,220
made easier so there's not these

00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,839
absolutely miniscule sheet tab buttons

00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,350
that they're much easier to use

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:21,009
particular big screens much improved

00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:23,509
number formatting new handling of table

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,870
reference types which is a new new Excel

00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:28,130
referencing time yea high DPI fixes for

00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,750
those people would be very expensive

00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:33,199
Chromebook which you can't see the

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,850
pixels on which is great and yeah just

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,100
ripping out and riri

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,470
be looking at some of our options which

00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,839
just don't make sense anymore you know

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:44,660
it's ridiculous allowing people to hard

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,740
aver right there user a system font I

00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:48,500
mean still there is a setting if you

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,630
want some advanced thing but cleaning up

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,880
the UI makes sense I got a new breeze

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,889
icon sets which is done biking son from

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,139
people from the KDE community which is

00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:59,120
cool and thanks to these guys for doing

00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:04,990
some great work there and I packaging

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:07,459
yet in various places yeah what else

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,650
even to your rendering yes okay so I'm

00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,900
you know GPUs are pretty awesome things

00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,010
and incredibly fast well they slow at

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,510
the same time interestingly you know

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,939
they they clocked quite low but they

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:18,890
have so such massive parallelism so

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,569
amusingly we've done the opencl stuff

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,490
first we're now doing the OpenGL stuff

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,140
to try and use the GPU that's a better

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:26,000
effect for rendering and that's that's

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,350
cool because we've had it for many years

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,780
our problems where you know you dump an

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,919
image in your document people complain

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,580
and they complain in one of two ways

00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,530
they say either it looks awful or when I

00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,970
resize it it's way too slow you know I

00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:39,440
can't interact with this thing I can't

00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,929
scroll around the document because this

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,460
is just too slow I rendering this thing

00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,960
and so does this kind of flip flop where

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:46,820
we go or we'll turn on the high quality

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,470
interpolation oh now we'll turn it off

00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,570
again you know we agree with the quick

00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:52,520
interpolation and hopefully OpenGL

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,610
allows us to do both so you know better

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:58,309
quality really good interpolation and

00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:00,590
also speed another huge thing is moving

00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:03,049
to double buffered rendering which is

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,309
one of those other just really big

00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,330
changes all over the place they're

00:18:04,309 --> 00:18:07,250
currently there's just no control on

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,760
rendering anyone can render anything at

00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:12,140
any time and they do which is a

00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,620
nightmare so in terms of being able to

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:17,090
double buffer that it's problem and

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,980
Tobias model and Jennifer Lee ball have

00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:21,590
done some great stuff to actually allow

00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,500
us to rapidly process work that needs to

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:27,350
be done so much better idle handling and

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,600
ordering give you an example so on the

00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,309
left which is odd I don't know I've come

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,990
left hand if something is the new

00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:35,090
version and on the right is the old and

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:38,210
hopefully you see some some improvement

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:39,650
so um not only was it slow interpolation

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,330
but it also fell back to the world's

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:43,190
most awful interpolation if you happen

00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:45,409
to have negative indices or rotate it or

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,730
something so you know we started to do

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,539
quite well their particular high

00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:50,179
frequency

00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:52,879
my frequency bits which is sir which is

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,700
encouraging I'm pleased and of course

00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:57,049
quicker other new I work improved

00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,239
sidebar so I mentioned change tracking

00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,460
it's a very big use case for a lot of

00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:03,289
our our users I'm out there so you know

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,029
improving is by providing a sidebar on

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,039
the sides you can see and navigate

00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:10,009
between the changes easily and accept

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,210
and reject them much more cleanly styles

00:19:10,009 --> 00:19:14,090
we keep trying to encourage people to

00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:15,619
use styles so there's still a mixture of

00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:18,320
paragraph styles and character styles

00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:19,940
but some yeah improving the sidebar to

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,739
make you look prettier and previewing

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:24,470
what the Styles look like hopefully

00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:26,149
helps helps people do that another thing

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,429
we have is a LibreOffice kit which is

00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:31,759
some a way of exposing the core of a

00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:33,109
LibreOffice it can be reused so there's

00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,429
a whole lot of good stuff in the profits

00:19:33,109 --> 00:19:36,950
but perhaps you don't want argue I

00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:39,139
perhaps you don't want you know the the

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,090
grief and aggravation of bootstrapping

00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:42,739
this thing yourself and so on in perhaps

00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,789
you don't want to link to anything you

00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:45,710
know perhaps you want to just drop some

00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:47,479
headers into your your project and then

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,039
you know have an entirely self-contained

00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,349
project and if you leave office is on

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:55,190
the computer it will find it link it and

00:19:51,349 --> 00:19:56,330
give you this simple C and C++ API see

00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,309
so you can use it so we explained

00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,840
several things through that file format

00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:01,820
filters so if you want to shift file

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,529
formats are we have actually customers

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,899
collaborate who who really want to

00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:07,639
convert lots of documents as quickly as

00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:11,059
possible to something human readable for

00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:14,119
indexing so you know anything to HTML is

00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,379
a nice filter to be able to use so she

00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,499
would not hold a to work here to make

00:20:15,379 --> 00:20:21,320
that quick you know not loading images

00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:23,389
not doing a word count before export to

00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,849
write statistics you don't need and this

00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:27,950
sort of thing so that this is improved

00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:31,129
in performance you know by yeah factor

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,989
of four or so in the last year and it's

00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:34,460
getting pretty good for indexing so and

00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:36,139
of course because it's LibreOffice it's

00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:37,609
just one thing it's easy to install the

00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:39,830
system it's just there if it's there you

00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:41,159
can use it and it copes with any file

00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,519
format pretty much

00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:47,700
from visio to publish to you know just

00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:50,129
random random stuff left and right so so

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,359
it's pretty cool its weak space tiled

00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,739
rendering so obviously you want to

00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,499
render bits of your documents and

00:20:52,739 --> 00:20:57,599
composers all these together and we now

00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:59,970
expose editing as well I'll talk about

00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,279
in a sec I'm so it's a very simple

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,249
simple API and the Android work is built

00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,989
on top of this the Libre Office online

00:21:05,249 --> 00:21:09,269
work is built on top of it and of course

00:21:06,989 --> 00:21:10,679
is filtering filtering logic so if flip

00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:12,419
phones also bring some new platform so

00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,789
windows 64-bit it's not something that's

00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,289
close to your heart's perhaps but you

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:18,509
know Linux 64-bit has been there for

00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:19,950
years and forever and forever but the

00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:22,979
way windows 64 works is a bit weird

00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:25,950
their approach to 64-bit nurse is not

00:21:22,979 --> 00:21:27,960
nice and thankfully thanks to see ibe

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:31,559
and a number of debit ostrovsky there

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,690
this is now being moved to fixed so it

00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,460
works and another thing we've done is on

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,809
lyrics again for ages so we've had the

00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,070
innovation first you know we've linked

00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,289
the whole thing into a single shared

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,419
library pretty much so the cold start is

00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:44,099
much improved need about halves your

00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,869
cold start time this is having lots of

00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:48,210
scattered shared libraries I'm so we'll

00:21:45,869 --> 00:21:50,729
be shipping that on Windows to 5.0 which

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:52,379
hopefully gives a real win I've Android

00:21:50,729 --> 00:21:54,629
editing of course it's going a 50 and

00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:57,509
some sun starts and we brought us online

00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:59,159
so let me see if I can talk about this I

00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:03,570
know how I'm doing for time just check

00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:05,519
my yeah not too badly okay I try to

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:06,599
remember i doing 30 good time someone

00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,070
will heckle me and throw me off the

00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:09,619
stage eventually so remember feeling

00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,649
good he's looking forward to it you know

00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:15,119
haha so there's some bits they're sort

00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:17,849
of integrating within cloud on android

00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,859
and also it's done by gail urine and

00:22:17,849 --> 00:22:21,149
then doing this editing work again

00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,039
funded by the donors to document

00:22:21,149 --> 00:22:24,149
foundation not creating a perfect user

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,649
interface but at least you know

00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:29,090
something let me let me see if i can

00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:29,090
make that actually work for you

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,290
yeah this is the kaylab conference

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,640
apparently so we'd see the only slide

00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,860
down and we've droid out screen is that

00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,429
it's um it actually polls on a sort of

00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,929
every second which is not which is not

00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,660
the world's slickest way of showing a

00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:49,309
user interface remotely but there you go

00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:51,110
it's actually free software so that's

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,700
some you know could be worse so I'm

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:55,520
going to just load up a document at the

00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:56,720
bottom here and I've alluded it but you

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,540
can't see it on the screen which is a

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,980
shame so some kind of funky delay here

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,860
but done this so this is the viewing

00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,660
that you just expect you have to see me

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,950
afterwards for the 60 frames per second

00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,900
beautiful scrolling goodness because

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:11,000
this looks like a a jerking nightmare

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,610
over here I think there are some videos

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,070
online that you can you can use you can

00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:17,690
see as well but just to show you the TNA

00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:22,850
we can we can edit these things and

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:24,679
going to improve how it all Frankie how

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,850
it all works you get to see all sorts of

00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,000
intermediates that are hard to see

00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:31,370
otherwise you know let me go here so

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,710
just tapping on numbered I can say you

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:37,790
know etc so this is the start of the

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,750
editing work and it's getting pretty

00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:43,220
well we're pretty pleased with that and

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,179
hmm it's a nice it's a nice missing

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:49,370
piece when you consider libre office

00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:50,630
online so what everyone thinks they want

00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,040
is to host all their documents in the

00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:53,690
cloud you know and it's all it's all

00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,150
somewhere there and it just runs in

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:57,770
every browser which is great until you

00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:00,530
get to pay for the server hosting you

00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:01,520
know cpu bandwidth storage and that's

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,110
something which point you realize what

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,120
you really want is like a thick client

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,830
that runs it and you know that gives has

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,030
everything safe luckily Libre Office has

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,309
all these bits it's what you call her

00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:12,350
you know complete solution has will have

00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,840
the online piece in another six months

00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,570
to nine months and then of course it has

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:21,080
the off offline mobile android phone

00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:23,450
tablet pc a piece that is probably what

00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,880
you really wanted anyway

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:28,559
so he brought us online hmm so there's a

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,909
pretty picture on the side here and then

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,929
there's some text on the right and if

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,809
you read it you won't be any the wiser

00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:35,399
um but it's it's all quite fun you know

00:24:33,809 --> 00:24:38,340
um so basically what we're doing is

00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:40,320
we're using the tiled rendering staff to

00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:42,299
be able to cash bits of documents as

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,730
images so what you'll end up in your

00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:46,559
device is using leaflets or repurposed

00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,649
version of leaflet which is a map a map

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,990
widget ultimately you get all of these

00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:54,450
tiles in your document again can will

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:57,029
see me later in the day or we have a

00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,059
nice booth somewhere here I think yeah

00:24:57,029 --> 00:25:02,250
five minutes perfect um so to come on

00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:03,990
come and get a demo um but we basically

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:06,240
a cash they said in theory if you come

00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,500
back and look at your document again you

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,820
don't actually need to even run lebra

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,009
this on the surf you can just serve

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,320
these tiles up and it's and it's done

00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:14,879
pretty much why ever bother to spin up

00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,370
that libre office on the server it just

00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:19,200
doesn't make any sense and it's it's

00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,730
reasonably heavy so then we you know

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,320
manage a whole pool of these LibreOffice

00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:24,659
processes running League rafas kit and

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,850
we can get a pre fork and spawn and in

00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,860
theory share you know all of the code

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,789
and a lot of the configuration across

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,899
those so they're a quick to bring up so

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:35,250
far that's not done because people want

00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,409
to run this on windows as well for a

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:41,009
reason that eludes me but so there you

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:42,450
are uh-huh and so so these these guys

00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,009
then will render that staff eventually

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,360
they'll get editing events to to allow

00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:46,350
you to you a mutated document but of

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,940
course there's no real need to keep

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,379
libre office in the background you know

00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,809
it's easy to save your document out and

00:25:49,379 --> 00:25:53,879
rehydrate it later so there's hundreds

00:25:51,809 --> 00:25:55,409
of tabs that you left open while with

00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:58,769
one google docs in each of them you know

00:25:55,409 --> 00:26:01,139
won't be killing your server which it

00:25:58,769 --> 00:26:02,460
which is good so there's a chunk of work

00:26:01,139 --> 00:26:04,470
going on there it'll be coming over the

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:06,990
next a nine nine to twelve months and

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,120
it's awesome so collaborative editing

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,139
and editing and so on at the moment we

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,679
have a viewer which works reasonably

00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:14,909
well but editing is coming you can see

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,889
the editing is basically the same thing

00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:19,200
as on android and that that's that's the

00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:20,190
nice nice thing that the tiling work and

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,019
the editing work is essentially a

00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,210
hundred percent shared between those two

00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:26,220
platforms so of course on this on this

00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:28,289
device you have a thread which is the UI

00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:30,149
thread doing your 60 frames a second

00:26:28,289 --> 00:26:31,919
zoom and pan and GL staff and then

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:33,510
another thread which is LibreOffice kit

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,370
rendering the tiles in the background

00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:38,580
it's basically the mozilla a

00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,630
neck a model where and online you have

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,580
something slightly different where you

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,020
have a front end which is in Australia

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,210
and the back end which is rendering all

00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:48,480
the dials in you know in violent the

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,340
worker right um so not not an incredibly

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,300
dissimilar model and the nice thing

00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,340
about that of course is that you can

00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,990
then get very responsive front end so

00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,030
you know that the browser itself is just

00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,440
moving images about and it can do that

00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:00,090
surprisingly slowly it's quite

00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,580
impressive actually fewer if you if you

00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:04,260
see it but yeah I mean but it's not our

00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,520
fault anymore that's the punchline the

00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,320
browser the browser people can go and

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,260
optimize their image you know scrolling

00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,030
and stuff and that's fine you're going

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,200
to get your your 60 frames a second

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,720
you'll zoom and then you'll refresh

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,890
behind it and get a very nice slick

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,179
snappy browser and mobile experience so

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,070
there you are that's the picture we have

00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:24,780
all these bits coming together and we

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:26,190
can support anything that you're doing

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,660
at collabera that's the greatest

00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:30,300
commercial plug there's a guy over here

00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,950
called corn house who who can help you

00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,900
with any migration deployment training

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,059
anything like that one of our many

00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,340
partners around the world and that's

00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,590
pretty much it so pick up time oh no it

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:44,070
isn't I'll I if you're near Cambridge on

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,690
May the 21st to 23rd which has a bit of

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,070
weekend and a bit of week in it so

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:50,550
there's no excuse you know like if

00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:52,950
you're a suit wearer or are free culture

00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:54,150
type there is a piece for you there it's

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:55,320
going to be awesome it's time to

00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,960
coincide with the Cambridge beer

00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:01,110
festival you know real ale a thousand

00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:03,120
beers of weird kinds come and drink

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:05,670
something with a silly name um see us

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,170
there and yeah there we go questions any

00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:10,279
questions comments do you have time for

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:12,919
two questions wrong we did perfect

00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:14,989
anyone at all was I horribly clear-eyed

00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:18,440
any think I was but we need a brave

00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:21,139
person who's brave who has courage to

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,450
ask question one and ruins are you I see

00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:27,349
this you know it are you coming to the

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:29,119
Cambridge beer fest or all of this can

00:28:27,349 --> 00:28:34,669
you get money out of arm to investigate

00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:36,759
this vital community effort Oh OpenStack

00:28:34,669 --> 00:28:39,349
is overlapping you know what can you do

00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:42,879
so andrew andrew has ever stack hot sir

00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:42,879
at the back with red top you for it

00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,519
that's absolutely knee problem yep I was

00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,610
not really online at a point in time

00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:57,230
okay as libre office planning to stay

00:28:53,610 --> 00:29:00,649
with the toolbar based GUI or are you

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:03,029
thinking about moving to this rubbish

00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:06,120
what is it called ribbons no no River

00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:07,620
the shreddin see yes I mean I think

00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,630
there's several answers there so you

00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,510
hopefully saw some of the sidebar stuff

00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,190
that we're doing in the site and I think

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,519
that provides actually a nicer and a

00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,139
better geometry area to do stuff in so

00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,610
so the sidebar is there but you don't

00:29:19,139 --> 00:29:22,409
have to use it you know you can turn

00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,440
that thing off which is probably quite

00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:28,529
important um if we do a ribbon which is

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,360
open question it would of course be

00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:32,190
configurable and I imagine we'll leave a

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,080
loss to whilst there I don't think

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:36,510
there's any any massive benefit in

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,100
forcing it on people the only problem is

00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:40,049
that there are people who are used to

00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,220
the old interface but there's an

00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,139
increasing generation of people who are

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:44,659
now used to the new interface and but

00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,429
they have the opposite problem they say

00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:48,539
look at these horrible toolbars that I

00:29:47,429 --> 00:29:51,600
have now learned the ribbon if you see

00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:53,130
what I mean so um you know they promises

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,570
let's see what happens come and

00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,279
contribute something yourself you know

00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:58,320
to set out that but we want people to

00:29:56,279 --> 00:30:00,000
feel comfortable in LibreOffice we want

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,179
them to you know you to feel familiar to

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,639
them but you know it's free software

00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:07,380
right so I think don't be scared of

00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,510
shocking and radical change if you can't

00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,320
undo because you can always undo it by

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,779
contributing make sense Oh another

00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,429
question um

00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:24,629
libreoff is's you mention is a fairly

00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:28,289
large project jump many landslides code

00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:34,129
etc it's eight million or that yep quite

00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:34,129
intricate what low-hanging fruit stole

00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:41,279
areas are there for somebody that wants

00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:44,580
to contribute back but is horrified and

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,229
shocked at this yeah you know monster in

00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:47,879
front of them yeah that kind of gets

00:30:46,229 --> 00:30:49,679
scared and run away and go actually I

00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:51,899
won't bother that's a really good

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:52,919
question so our predecessors some were

00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:53,999
very interested in the consulting

00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,529
business and they would go around

00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:57,089
telling people how awful the code was

00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:58,379
and how no one could understand if you

00:30:57,089 --> 00:31:00,269
accept them so you better come and pay

00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:02,460
us and you know being a consultant

00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:04,289
myself I have you know something of this

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,210
this injured so I think if you're going

00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:08,190
to do some really advanced layout

00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,479
feature you know you're going to improve

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,789
the hallway tables done you're going to

00:31:09,479 --> 00:31:13,859
need an expert but there are so much low

00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,599
hanging fruits around the place but it's

00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:18,059
very easy to do something meaningful um

00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,979
so just an example you like this the

00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,299
sidebar for for change tracking it's

00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:23,940
going to be really useful like that's

00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:25,289
going to save me real time every day but

00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,299
actually it's just taking the existing

00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:29,309
dialogue elements and making them also

00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:31,589
appear in the sidebar and tweaking them

00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:33,239
a bit so this is not like a massive

00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:35,669
development effort it's a few days of

00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:37,739
work you know for a volunteer I think

00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:39,359
and so that's sick so I think there's

00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:41,129
just there's a load of places where it's

00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,799
easy to get involved and provide value

00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:45,210
for 80 million people that make you know

00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:46,830
make free software seem seem awesome

00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,330
because everything cool easy hacks where

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,339
you can get in breezy and there's a list

00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:52,859
of projects and the code files they're

00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:54,149
in and the problem with those is getting

00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:56,339
developers to restrain themselves from

00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:58,080
fixing you know so they find a little

00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:59,339
NIT like oh I could fix that oh but I'll

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,379
I'll just hold off and I'll write

00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:03,960
exactly how to do it into the wiccan at

00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,249
this bug tracker and then you can just

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,739
come in and you can get the satisfaction

00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:09,479
of doing it yourself and get someone who

00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:11,909
knew what they wanted to review it and

00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:13,289
make sure it goes it so that's one way

00:32:11,909 --> 00:32:15,239
we get a lot of people into the project

00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:16,979
and encourage them and help them get

00:32:15,239 --> 00:32:18,059
familiar with the cage and it's like

00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,989
pulling one of these small strings you

00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,059
know you fix a little thing and

00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:22,379
eventually you end up with your in

00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:24,119
aircraft carrier you know if you keep

00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:26,380
pulling long enough you know you can

00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:27,910
become in a vital

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,880
and respected maintainer in the

00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:32,620
community of some thank you so much

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,970
would have been very patience and good I

00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,970
