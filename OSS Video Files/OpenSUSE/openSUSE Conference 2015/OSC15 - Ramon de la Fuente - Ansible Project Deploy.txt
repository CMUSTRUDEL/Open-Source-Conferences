Title: OSC15 - Ramon de la Fuente - Ansible Project Deploy
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	Ansible is a provisioning tool rapidly growing in popularity, mainly due to it’s simplicity. But it’s capable of more than just provisioning! In this talk, I’ll walk you through an Ansible role that can be used to deploy your projects. Those familiar with Capistrano wil recognize the method, but I’ll explain it step by step and in the end I’ll show a real-world example from a Symfony2 project: the SweetlakePHP website. (this talk assumes some knowledge of how Ansible works)

After this talk, you should be able to use the featured role to deploy your projects, as well as write your own based on the Ansible deploy_helper module.
