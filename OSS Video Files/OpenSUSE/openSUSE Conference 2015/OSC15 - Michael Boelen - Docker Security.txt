Title: OSC15 - Michael Boelen - Docker Security
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	How to securely deploy your containers, by the author of rkhunter and auditing tool Lynis.

Many introductory talks about Docker and its container technology, have been given. This attention to the subject is not surprising, seeing the amount of people "doing DevOps" now. With container technology being fairly new on the Linux platform, the security aspects of containers are often being overlooked. While Linux containers do still not fully contain from a security point of view, we can definitely improve the security level of them. In this talk, we have a look at the underlying Linux security measures, followed by the features Docker itself has to offer. The goal is to get an understanding how we can deploy containers in a secure way. After all, Docker is no longer just a toy, and our precious data is involved.

good afternoon

00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:08,559
my name is Sir Michael bulan and founder

00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,390
at sea to find my own company I'm

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,670
helping companies with auditing

00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:17,380
and it's an

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:17,380
extension to previous work

00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,450
cements if people already use that

00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,450
before

00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,869
and the meanest

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:36,080
okay rocket enters specifically for

00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,400
scanning malware on linux and unix

00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,730
systems

00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,719
there's a more general tool to scan

00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:48,489
security defenses

00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,489
and specifically focused on linux

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,560
today I'm talking a little bit about the

00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:59,730
Joker because it's out the topic and I'm

00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:04,890
seeing it being an extension to

00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:08,610
the Linux ecosystem in which

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:11,790
more and more people are using it but

00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,370
the level of security people simply

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,590
skipped the part

00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:19,340
vegetable

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,820
gets killed quickly but

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,429
sometimes they simply step back or take

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,080
a few steps back regarding their

00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:30,960
security defenses

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,590
well my goal is to extend those

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,060
likeliness

00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,060
provide information about

00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:45,070
so why I'm interested in soccer is to

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,070
get an understanding minutes

00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,350
equal to what p.m.

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,020
physical machines

00:01:54,219 --> 00:02:00,390
cocaine

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,390
general I the next

00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,570
then I'm doing a development

00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,270
and

00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:14,610
get better understanding but also trying

00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:17,900
to

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,900
in violent

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,530
my goodness

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:28,510
after a lot of research I found

00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:33,220
stripping

00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:35,620
issues and about one is that isn't much

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,100
and if you find some something maybe

00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,790
already out

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,400
well become still

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,360
subject

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,360
some information is very

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,010
some advice

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,010
one page

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:58,410
sometimes because outdated

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,020
wrong understanding of subject

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,530
and usually security is not really that

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,560
important

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,560
Oh

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:09,420
my proposal is to fix a few things

00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,480
it's not something I'm doing alone

00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:18,590
everyone

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,069
subject itself Joker

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:21,069
or even better

00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,220
so this is

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:31,500
main proposal

00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:34,150
combination of building the right tools

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,330
documentation correctly

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,910
blogging about it

00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:43,080
presentations like

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:45,000
or also giving input to existing

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,980
projects because if you look for example

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,580
get that see a lot of Joker related

00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,280
snippets for

00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,060
container information

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,730
change a lot of

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:01,810
vulnerable Confederation so actually

00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:04,630
those people

00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:07,170
try to do their best to help others they

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,069
actually make it worse for them

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,069
interesting one

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,980
no the ball today is quickly it now to

00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:18,970
stabilize the big vessel and then secure

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,370
the containers and cup of it

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:23,680
you look quickly at the benefits of the

00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:26,830
Opera itself then especially this in

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,430
regards to security the risks involved

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,430
it's

00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:34,199
defenses five already

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:42,850
the whole thing is about the one the

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,960
only and its data after all well unless

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:49,430
you're using docker just to play with it

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,960
want to do something

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:54,830
and it might be

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,449
writing for example engineer

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,030
container

00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,560
it's turn

00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:02,940
sharing data

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,840
the rest

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,409
in the end it always comes back to theta

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:13,289
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:13,289
data or avoid showing today

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,950
oh it's about the data sharing and it's

00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,970
about

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,970
some data

00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:27,389
small warning and that's a doper ish

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:30,279
they're going very fast very very fast

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:32,750
so i might be telling something right

00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:34,990
now which is

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:38,260
alive

00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,520
so if you catch me on something fresh

00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,520
man let me know

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:50,230
some benefit delta kia ones already

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,480
flexibility scalability and better

00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,810
testing developer you can now run

00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:56,980
something

00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:56,980
be able to pick it up

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,670
prediction fire

00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,740
interesting and clearly your primary

00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,740
benefits

00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:16,390
regarding security one big and

00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:20,290
five segregation so you can split up

00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:22,310
big junk into smaller things then build

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,310
defenses around it

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:27,910
ensuring that dish information is beep

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,910
doubtful

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:38,930
and most security people considered

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:41,889
aggregation splitting up things

00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,889
most of us

00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,650
to Granada

00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,430
zimbra can

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,430
in its actions

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,980
opportunity to better understand it

00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,350
defend yourself against any transfer an

00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,350
issue which

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,300
information disclosure is often an

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,060
most people don't

00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,800
it's there

00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,700
by using containers we can actually

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,840
smaller

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,840
for our defenses

00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:36,259
some risks well

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,259
not specifically photographer

00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:43,319
it's simply Burke's get

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,700
changes

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,310
that's because of

00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:53,670
features but especially a lot of

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,849
products

00:07:53,670 --> 00:08:00,080
so security vulnerabilities

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:03,230
a year ago

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,100
Joker had some

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,100
not really that many

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,680
being discovered

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,780
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,670
they really have to cover up a few

00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:29,900
base regarding issues that level so they

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:32,330
woke up and said okay security is not

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:34,510
something we can skip anymore should

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,959
really build them into the product

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,959
because people are

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,039
fell with all those quick developments

00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:45,520
that means they also a lot of dead

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,000
circling

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,930
then there's no Lisa the big question

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,990
with all those people contributing

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:59,180
now how safe is really people not making

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,620
the same in the states which we have

00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:04,220
seen that they go to feel

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,960
Nikolas

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,380
easy to make a mistake and especially

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,380
well

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,100
and there's the knowledge a gap

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,990
not sure how many people here have an IT

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,990
auditor around

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:27,089
someone

00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:31,879
other people who do security checks for

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:31,879
them like a pen testing or

00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,910
okay that's much better

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:41,100
for those people it's really hard to

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:44,870
keep up with this because it's not that

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,870
just one of the many tools

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,370
it's a challenging one but also for your

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,050
colleagues might be interesting

00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:56,720
yourself

00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,240
staying up to date all the time is

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,350
pretty challenging and I see it myself

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,780
as well I have to

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:08,060
research all the time to make sure that

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:08,060
I know too much light

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,540
one of the the biggest issues is still

00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:16,760
the isolation

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:21,640
not being able to

00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:24,970
degrees getting better in it

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,910
put more defenses on your container

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,089
it does isolation but at the same time

00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:34,360
it's still not full

00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:37,110
real container which keeps things

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,110
develop

00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:43,089
yeah for example

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:50,220
and using a container it's

00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:52,920
still if you are able to get root inside

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,320
the container you are also rude in the

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:58,040
whole system itself so let's clear

00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,040
escape

00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:05,790
a serious issue

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,790
that's one of the last ones and big ones

00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,680
able to

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,110
final goal is that if you would be able

00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:17,160
to own

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,649
container

00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,259
be able to do

00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:23,240
except what application can do as well

00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:26,660
but in the end you should say okay

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:30,339
through the pain of a infection survey

00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:30,339
as well it could be infection or

00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:37,520
to some the defense's doctor already

00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:40,180
built in and it's also

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,180
bye

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,960
so they started going for it yes only

00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:51,910
edit

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,430
the download

00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:55,140
verification

00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,950
make sure that what you're downloading

00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,950
is reading

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:02,870
what you believe your download is

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,870
reading what you down

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,940
container technology and I think most of

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:11,750
us they already know that around

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,740
namespaces and see groups to

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,740
isolate

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,310
by splitting up functions within the

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:25,130
operating system

00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,130
you can create without

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,340
one of the other things they use is

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,340
second

00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,040
and capabilities

00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:42,480
it's too many Shepard

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:45,620
and those edits

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,620
then last but not least

00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,570
so namespaces they do isolation and

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:57,320
there are different image places like

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,010
the process

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,550
hotel

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,310
ok

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,690
routing

00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,750
that's fine

00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:12,290
neck rolls sort of the kennel

00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:14,240
and you have user name spaces and that's

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:16,480
one of the biggest issues regarding the

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
rules

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:21,649
container outside

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:28,059
that's depending on the user's education

00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:30,970
and that's totally implement

00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:35,160
so

00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:37,580
your IP see for process communication

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:40,270
post name

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,270
related

00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,470
font

00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,230
check on the screw computing mode to

00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:55,880
motor in that mature

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,880
anyone already your state

00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:04,949
okay push using chrome Chrome browser

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:15,030
what else are you using them

00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:19,760
oma fire folks ok that's ok

00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:23,220
now chrome is for using it for example 2

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,800
to build and send book so it's not

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,040
sandbox technology that you can actually

00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,310
limit what kind of functions are allowed

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,490
and by using that properly you can build

00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,490
your own

00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,910
and stated isolation

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:46,750
immediate approach is really

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:48,940
limits access to the

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,070
it's especially interesting for

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,360
developers if you want an application

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,590
and you say oh

00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:58,640
limit the possible risks

00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,640
and what it can do

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,360
two

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,360
to achieve this like

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,860
example disco

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,860
a child

00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:24,230
helps already a lot of

00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:26,290
encountering again

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,840
effects like

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:29,590
noting an issue

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,730
what you

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:32,730
by pastas

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,240
controller groups

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:44,260
they can schedule a

00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,340
restricts what you can do to about

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:50,470
resources about the priority of

00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:54,360
accounting so we'll attempt someone more

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,360
hot has some process done

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,730
billing purposes maybe for big South's

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:01,860
companies

00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:05,190
want to know okay this is what

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,830
what's user and what's process has been

00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,640
used

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:10,040
to Bill according that

00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,420
it's about their control

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,420
okay this project has to be

00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:20,600
then you have capabilities have

00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:28,600
smaller roles small functionality

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,520
there's a default list of allowed

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:34,980
can add them

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,980
minus minus get heads

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,110
one girl or you can combine them

00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,250
together stay okay I want to drop first

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,250
everything then

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,960
denied one shoe

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,089
these are a few of the

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,339
capabilities

00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:01,339
people are already aware of

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,610
capabilities is really some technique

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,120
which is there for a long time already

00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,689
but you never see

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,689
well

00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:24,220
for example do the ping command

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,260
remove the sender ID a bit then it won't

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:29,050
work anymore that you have the

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,640
capability to open network sockets you

00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:32,710
can make

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,150
it's a nice trick to

00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,299
get rid of machete wagon

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,169
so

00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:40,169
still being able to

00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,750
then the frameworks of armor as a Linux

00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,750
people your step

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,230
who directly should it down then they

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,740
save on their system as a leader for

00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:56,740
example

00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,610
desktop okay

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,070
well it's interesting because because of

00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,220
being a staple framework you can isolate

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:12,210
the spell again

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,080
this process can existential

00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:16,929
so

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,870
this yourself if you doing it now and

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:23,340
get familiar with it you can also apply

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:23,340
it to containers that's

00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:29,309
because things are small

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:34,559
and

00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:37,470
the rules have smallest fellow on old

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,980
full system they have one policy for

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,980
everything

00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:44,609
system does what it should be

00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:47,710
regarding containers if you make once

00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:50,080
that small snippet though

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,240
thinks it should be allowed to do and

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,770
deny

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,790
everything else

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,770
then that knowledge can be really

00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,770
simply apply to other containers

00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:09,100
the adult subsistent before using that

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,290
gentlemen being doing everything already

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:23,530
that's that's nice and

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,490
britta to the Felton's and it's mostly

00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,600
about

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,780
setting a watch old mouse itself Wow

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,850
handles

00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,250
and all the testicles

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,660
very powerful if you want to know what

00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:41,710
process or other process is doing

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:43,460
for which process actually changed the

00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:46,160
time for example

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:49,820
the time jumping off

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:52,870
what is the related system call with

00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,870
what Charlotte

00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,610
by the shelf crystal

00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,610
program this

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:04,330
is in those name

00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:08,940
creating a user

00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,940
whatever interests in New York days

00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,160
Oh

00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,799
men

00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:21,270
it would be looking something like like

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,309
for example if you want to trek through

00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,529
possible files

00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:27,200
you put the watch on it and the related

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:29,870
power

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,880
the permissions

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,520
can give the cue name so that you can

00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,390
move similar files likely to file the

00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,390
sheriff

00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:43,830
church for those events which are later

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,830
I love

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:50,650
especially that systemd now as well

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,650
sipping tea and others others

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,990
so if you have one local place on log

00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:02,000
data is then the other two things are

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,000
there as well hopefully loose

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:11,270
Jenna

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:14,260
and so my best practices well first of

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,260
all the docker hose itself

00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:20,310
really

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,310
cheers hardening and other things

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,460
but then the next level would be

00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:29,220
operating

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:33,149
security issue the engine death

00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:35,710
you have to really apply it local levels

00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:39,160
the framework has been

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:43,470
you can of course limits

00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,470
as access to the dower house itself

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,309
for my breakfast but still

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:51,940
given

00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,490
make sure that you can also update

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:02,000
sometimes because of the features but

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,000
sometimes

00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,610
which really affects

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,850
and important as well the doctor

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,630
information on the house itself it

00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:18,790
should be kept

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:18,790
because of the security issues and also

00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:24,090
and what you see now is that dockers

00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,940
really adding you

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,730
also regarding security

00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:33,010
Oh

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,010
to get an idea how important

00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,880
can the container itself now armor and

00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,330
sob Nixon apply

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,740
capabilities

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:52,230
the Preferences to drop first capability

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:52,230
credible then add only the ones

00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,530
depends a little bit on the complexity

00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,530
of the software

00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:07,140
similar using the second

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:10,380
it bends a little bit of you can use it

00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,600
because of the origin Joker has with

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,920
Alexi

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:21,050
what they are using now their own

00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:21,050
part so that means that second

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,590
sure if they do

00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:31,409
then you have also the

00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:33,440
iptables filtering which you can fly of

00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,440
course

00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,309
Sean traffic is allowed

00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,430
it's the

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:45,440
network

00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,440
userspace you can

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:52,100
figure routing for example

00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,760
I tables on top of it

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,540
so specific

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,540
traffic

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:04,540
a few new things are retold in

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,540
containers but its local 15

00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:09,100
that helps

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,600
adding a restriction to what a container

00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,840
can do

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,840
what

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:26,670
and the locking wasn't

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:29,720
before happens it's logging was stored

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:32,120
in a container or not

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,790
but you can do now is to find a local

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:39,370
driver to get the data actually outside

00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:39,370
the container so it is a better place

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,540
or

00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,470
and also when you want us to

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,190
available

00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,820
OS itself

00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:00,820
you can

00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,000
to your container

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:10,650
description

00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:17,640
Phil everything

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,640
still

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,840
it's one part of the

00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:27,990
the pieces in which

00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:32,000
it's not a real security escape but at

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,000
the same time you can cause a denial too

00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:38,730
then another one is regarding soccer

00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,490
management itself so that the

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:46,150
diminishment of the containers possible

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:47,680
encrypt your connections

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,870
two variables

00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,830
I see more and more people actually

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:56,460
using it so took some time but

00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:56,460
better

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:03,470
then common one which is also getting

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:07,360
better people want to manage their

00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:09,880
containers so they could SSH

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,720
that oversaw that more and more people

00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,720
who are doing it

00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,220
better alternative

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,350
exactly

00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,350
or

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:27,910
container itself

00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,660
I guess

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,470
well the openness ones and what you can

00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,120
make read only

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:44,029
make that three stone

00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:47,529
might be among your

00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,529
35 for

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:56,760
and the rebound

00:26:53,929 --> 00:27:00,110
byesville

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:04,010
and the nettings that's the usual

00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:04,010
namespace now the deaths

00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:09,470
so

00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,050
linux

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:16,050
Colonels

00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:18,980
kept it already and what's

00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:22,090
just find this if you are rude

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:22,090
host itself

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,780
I 0

00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:30,330
but you now can say is I want root user

00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:33,770
for my container but methods on a

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,770
different user ID

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,450
at ten thousands

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:43,210
in the container if you escape from it

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:44,460
you are still use a 10,000 on the house

00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:48,260
itself

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:48,260
and of course you don't get that

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:52,160
special access

00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:52,160
though

00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,770
increasing the risk

00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:07,460
and then this is finished then

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,570
usual mapping pod

00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,310
will be very helpful

00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:23,530
tell you what containers have to offer

00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,120
excavation of

00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:35,099
help

00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:35,099
penetrating the restaurants

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,700
then the first parts still people

00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:42,440
download the images from other people

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,700
because they just want to play with it

00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,700
but that's also

00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:49,490
risk full

00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:54,290
net

00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:57,490
sometimes people have

00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,490
the right intentions

00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,860
build-in begged or spell so they're

00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,860
possible don't use it

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:10,470
in there are some metals limited my own

00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,330
since

00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,919
gender Barry I built

00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:17,779
which

00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,289
itself you can use it to

00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:24,820
all that your daugher files but I've

00:29:21,289 --> 00:29:28,909
seen by investigating a few owners of

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:31,359
Joker files from github many common

00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:31,359
mistakes people

00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:38,050
temperature 70

00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,680
not sure why people do that

00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:44,760
but also downloading external components

00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:47,350
with any verification for example

00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,140
that's

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:53,500
free available and if you say a penis

00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,740
out its docker file then provides the

00:29:53,500 --> 00:30:00,050
doc palette cell

00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,050
see those kind of communist states say

00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:07,310
maybe tempura fish

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,310
another interesting by this opens cap

00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,770
open skype

00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:20,150
open skepta is in

the open person yep

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,039
and skeptics protocol and

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,759
Oh

00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:30,140
automation of security content now still

00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:33,210
doesn't say that much

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:37,520
several rules

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:41,279
information and script a mother does is

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:45,450
helps you scanning your systems by

00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,880
providing XML house and also pieces of

00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:51,830
script to

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,570
mitigate any issues can build a policy

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:55,440
into

00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,440
Mick smell foul

00:30:55,570 --> 00:31:00,200
in this in this system and any issues

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,190
from that will be my peasant

00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,680
finding

00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:08,100
I simply want to fix it I always want to

00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:08,100
ensure that

00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:14,320
opens cap

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:21,820
very popular in the US and that's

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,360
because of the English

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,370
bottoms

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,370
regarding the pencil button

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,120
ha

00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:38,360
guidelines apply

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,360
open skype this help

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:46,940
and the last but important thing dr.

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,940
coach very very

00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:58,919
datatel also the news block itself must

00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:58,919
say dat to that very well a lot of

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,020
the news itself

00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,110
it's nice to run suffering in the fire

00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:12,910
a lot of

00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:19,929
the risk might not be worth

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,990
then

00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:31,629
Pixar and

00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:46,339
so if you turn off the HTML

00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:49,539
docker container but you're hosting for

00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:49,539
someone else how do you give them access

00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:57,680
yeah that's an interesting one

00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,080
it depends if and by people need access

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,130
to the container itself so if you really

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,910
need to do management on

00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:07,830
now then you can also make depends on

00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:11,180
your situation of what you can give them

00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,180
access to the house itself

00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:17,750
they have simply

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,060
one container because young many

00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,660
Christmas

00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,660
the same pose

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,610
i would say it depends on your situation

00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:32,090
which is why

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:36,460
from the basic point of view if you

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:36,460
don't need it yourself don't add it

00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:42,220
he needs that

00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,220
fair point

00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,780
