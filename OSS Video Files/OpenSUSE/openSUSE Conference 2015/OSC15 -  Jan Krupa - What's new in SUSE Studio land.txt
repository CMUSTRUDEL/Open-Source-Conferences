Title: OSC15 -  Jan Krupa - What's new in SUSE Studio land
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	This talk will give you introduction to SUSE Studio, what you can use it for and how you can build openSUSE based appliances with just a few clicks on the web. Our team added quite a lot of new features over the past two years. I'll try to cover all of them and give you more details about what we improved. You can look forward for a live demo as well as information on how to join the community around SUSE Studio or our team.

okay so i will start my name is yang

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,110
koopa i'm working as an operation

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,009
engineer and susie studio team and build

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:15,929
service team i'm working in Susa for

00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:19,109
about five years i joined this to your

00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,910
team when the beginning when right a few

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,900
months after it was launched for the

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:27,269
public I'm not working mostly on the

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,090
infrastructure that doesn't mean

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:31,980
hardware side because our servers are

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,110
far away from the location where I work

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,710
but mostly on the software level that

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,350
means automation of the installation

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,140
post configuration and as well as

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,379
deployments because Suzy studio is

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,329
mostly Rite of supplication and we do

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,710
continuous deployment so that's quite

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,219
some challenge in terms of

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:56,430
infrastructure and avoiding outages and

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:59,850
stuff like that so that's something

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:04,229
about me and now I like to tell you

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,530
something about Suzy studio I guess some

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:10,830
of you already know studio maybe some of

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,570
you don't so I will speak for about five

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,119
minutes to give you some brief

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,860
introduction before I jump on the new

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,610
stuff we implemented in studio in the

00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,890
past one or two years so what is Suzy

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,810
studio so this video is an appliance

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,409
builder from studio perspective

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:31,380
appliance is is an image which contains

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:34,829
operating system applications and also

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,650
configuration of those two things so to

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:39,540
give you an example of what could be an

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,180
appliance and how it can be used for

00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,820
let's say you want to start blogging on

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,790
the board wordpress platform so we do

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,159
need for that is some machine could be

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,409
virtual could be physical then you need

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,840
operating system let's say we will use

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,159
open Suzy for that and on top of that

00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:03,149
you need to have a patchy PHP my sequel

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,360
and WordPress itself so what you

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,060
normally do is to 12 vm or take a

00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,300
physical machine and install all the

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,480
required software on that configure

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:19,340
it and it will probably take like 30 or

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,770
45 minutes to do that that's the old way

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:24,740
but if you use this to do you can be

00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,210
done within five or ten minutes because

00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,660
everything can be done on the web and

00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:31,730
once you configure the operating system

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,640
and all of the applications on top of

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:37,550
that which can be done just a few mouse

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,680
clicks you can download the resulting

00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,750
image quite quickly and then you just

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,460
put it on the machine or inside the

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,530
virtual machine and what's interesting

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,120
about it is if you had more of these

00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,890
machines you can duplicate it quite

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,840
easily just downloading the image to

00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:56,450
some other location this is how the

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,450
configuration looks like it's the

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,420
software selection tab on top you can

00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,590
see that you can customize the appliance

00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,030
the way that you can put different

00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,220
repositories so you don't really have to

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,380
be dependent just on the opensuse

00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,420
repositories you can use other build

00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:14,360
service repos or year round or you can

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:17,239
even upload your your custom files on

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:19,310
top of the appliance on the bottom of

00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:22,910
the page you see that there is a list of

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,640
applications which were added to the to

00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:27,860
the appliance so for the word plus

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,050
appliance this could be the Apache or

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:36,489
PHP and stuff like that we support

00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:40,220
various bills formats starting from

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:43,340
formats for physical machines that's the

00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:48,530
USB stick or the preload USB image life

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:51,250
CD and other as well as virtual machines

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:54,980
that means if you want to deploy it on

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:57,500
VMware or virtual box or kvm or is LAN

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,060
it's also possible you just click on

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,470
different build target and within five

00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,430
minutes you have the measure you have

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,920
the image for different platform and

00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,690
recently we started to support also

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:16,100
different cloud platforms so I would say

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:17,540
like Suzy cloud or ec2 this is quite as

00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,970
the interesting feature of studio

00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:24,360
because usually if you are configuring

00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:26,129
the image you had some problems and

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,259
normal workflow will be probably to

00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:30,419
configure it downloaded tested you find

00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,099
out that something is wrong then you

00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,129
start from the beginning and downloaded

00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:36,930
take some bandwidth to do that but we

00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:40,169
leak what you can do in studio is to

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,330
launch the lunch d appliance directly

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,759
from a browser on our servers it will

00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:47,310
boot up you can interact with that that

00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:50,400
includes even the desktop like you can

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,590
put gnome integra no man you can test

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,680
various applications and test your

00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,469
configuration if you find some problem

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,330
you just rebuild it and once you are

00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:01,949
happy you download the appliance

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,680
everything is done in the browser

00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:08,300
without any special requirements for

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,300
software installation on the client side

00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:17,969
we also have product call susie studio

00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:22,229
on site that's mainly focused on

00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:24,270
companies which does want to run studio

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:27,719
on their own infrastructure the

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:30,779
difference is that there are their

00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:33,599
various differences mostly minor the

00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,849
biggest one is that we support s390

00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:40,139
architecture on the sweetest view on

00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:42,360
side so that's something you can you can

00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:49,800
do if you want to use it in on your own

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:52,919
infrastructure because this this was

00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,189
just a theory so I want what I was

00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,379
thinking about how to I was thinking

00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,210
about some real life examples where you

00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:01,770
can use studio and I don't mean just

00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,659
examples how you can use it in your

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,939
company but how you can use it in your

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:08,430
daily life and how it can make your life

00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:11,550
easier so I came with three examples

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,189
which maybe could you could find

00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:20,610
interesting and that could be reason why

00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:22,979
you would try studio first is situation

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:26,460
which probably most of us have already

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:29,580
encountered and that's you started a

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,219
computer and there is some weird error

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,300
message saying that the drive is failed

00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:37,490
there are some bad sectors on that and

00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,610
I'm sure that

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:45,860
most of us do daily backups but yeah

00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,750
sometimes we don't and in that case what

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,699
we start to do is probably the first

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,090
thing would be to look for some rescue

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:55,610
CD or some installation CD from Oakland

00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,990
Suzie booted up fire up the rescue

00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:02,810
prompt and try to do something with that

00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:06,380
but usually the problem is that there

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,870
are some tools missing in this CD so and

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,479
we need to use these tools for for the

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,880
repair of the of the computer so the

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,590
next step would be to fire up google try

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,800
to search for some rescue CD try

00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:20,659
different options and I guess in like 30

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,330
minutes 60 minutes maybe we will have

00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:25,490
our finally our rescue CD working and

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,069
start with the process of rescuing the

00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:31,009
data from the drive if you use to do for

00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:33,050
that what we can do is just click on the

00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:35,120
new appliance select open Susie as a

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,909
base image and then we select the list

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,039
of the software we need there for the

00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:41,630
risk you and this doesn't have to be

00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,380
just the software which is included in

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,820
the default opensuse repository it could

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,840
be software from the old service or

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:54,889
somebody repos and by this process you

00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,590
can have your rescue CD or USB flash

00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,020
drive done in five or ten minutes and

00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,940
start to focus on rescuing the data

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,449
because usually these things happen when

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,740
you have like a zero time or really

00:08:05,449 --> 00:08:10,610
minimum time because there is some

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,849
deadlines coming and yeah so that was

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,900
first example another example would be a

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:21,250
more from a company perspective let's

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,719
say you received 100 new computers and

00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:27,590
you have to install one particular

00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:30,680
application on all of them I guess the

00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,899
option where you install all of them

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,750
manually is not really on the plate here

00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:38,990
because 100 computers means that you can

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:41,450
spend like a week with that and I guess

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,720
after installing one or two of them you

00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,120
will find it a bit boring so the logical

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,779
next step what you would try is to do

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,569
some kind of automation

00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:56,529
I guess maybe pixie boot and artist

00:08:52,569 --> 00:08:58,629
that's pretty good choice and if you

00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:02,459
have skills in to confine configuring

00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:04,749
the pixie booth and artists together and

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:07,180
creating the OTS scripts and

00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:10,360
configuration file that's very good

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,759
option but if you are not really skilled

00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,100
in August configuration what could be

00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,410
easier is to create an image in studio

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,329
and distribute that image where the same

00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,660
process why pics aboot to all of those

00:09:19,329 --> 00:09:25,300
machines it could also be a little bit

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,660
quicker depending on what's inside the

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:31,199
image but in general it will be much

00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,939
easier because you don't really have to

00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:36,519
look on the details of the configuration

00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:40,029
file you just push it there by other

00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:44,160
pixie boots server and the third example

00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:47,980
is something which I guess a lot of

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,509
experience too since we are from the IT

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:54,850
field most of our friends consider us as

00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,879
the IT guy which can fix everything and

00:09:54,850 --> 00:10:00,639
that means that whenever they computer

00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:04,149
bro breaks they call us and ask us to

00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:07,149
fix it usually that means we have to

00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:08,980
visit them or if we want to help them of

00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,449
course we have to visit them and spend

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:15,069
like two or three hours we're installing

00:10:10,449 --> 00:10:17,649
the computer but what we can do with

00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:19,750
studio is that we can configure their

00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:21,670
computer into the studio at their

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,939
application there there occasions they

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:27,250
are using like Firefox or LibreOffice

00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:29,740
maybe some games you can even add

00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:31,240
repositories from some proprietary when

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,910
there's like you can add skype in there

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,579
and then build the image and create a

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:40,600
real flash drive or city realty here on

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:43,179
Drive and once you insert that in the

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,290
target computer it's just matter of

00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:48,939
hitting two times enter and the whole

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,980
computer is reinstall to the initial

00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:53,920
state so if you have the data partition

00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,660
separately you you are good to go and

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,660
you don't even have to be physically

00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,670
that your nightie friend can handle that

00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,939
and he can reinstall the computer quite

00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,939
quickly

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:10,759
so that's that were like three examples

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,550
which I think could you could find

00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:14,420
interesting and now I'd like to move to

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:17,300
the second part of the presentation

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,339
where I like to tell you something about

00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,970
the new features which we worked on in

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:26,269
studio for the past two years I think we

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:29,329
were talking about studio in 2012 on the

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:32,120
opensuse conference and so I try to

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:35,920
summarize some most important thing

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:39,499
which we changed and what we made to the

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,720
to this view so the first thing which

00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:46,550
comes to my mind is the support for new

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,740
distributions we support two different

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:52,939
distributions first is open Susie and

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:56,420
secondly suse linux enterprise what we

00:11:52,939 --> 00:11:57,800
try to do is to release support for both

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,439
of those distribution as soon as

00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:03,230
possible sometimes we make it on the day

00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:06,529
one sometimes it takes a bit longer but

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:11,480
in general we are trying to always

00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:14,179
support the latest latest stuff so

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,759
currently you can build open Susie 13.2

00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:19,370
you as well as Lee 12 appliances in

00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:21,230
studio without the problem and for those

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:26,749
various target platforms which I

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:31,009
mentioned in the beginning we also added

00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:34,220
a new cloudbuilt targets that means that

00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:38,420
you can build images and appliances for

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:40,459
Susie cloud you can build that for ec2

00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:44,540
you can build that for Microsoft Azure

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:47,449
and for OpenStack for some of these

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:49,519
platforms it's not just about support of

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:52,670
building those formats but it's also

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,939
about support for deploying those format

00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:58,040
so if I come back to the example with

00:12:55,939 --> 00:13:00,199
WordPress appliance which I mentioned in

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,540
the in the beginning what it means that

00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:05,689
you can start with configuring of the

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:07,279
WordPress in studio and in the end you

00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:09,949
don't download it to your computer and

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,319
upload it to some vm somewhere you can

00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:14,389
deploy directly from studio so let's say

00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,710
too easy to you just click insert your

00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:17,420
credentials there

00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,450
it's automatically deployed and launched

00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:23,060
on ec2 it's completely seamless and

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,650
what's quite cool about this is that you

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,210
don't really have to touch command line

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,670
from the beginning to the end everything

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:33,620
is done quite seamlessly if you don't

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:36,260
want to of course you can but we also

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:39,830
there is introduced HTTPS only access

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,600
when we started studio we always have

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:45,110
the possibility to access to do why

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:48,620
HTTPS but we were quite afraid that the

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,540
requirement to use HTTPS would be a

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,580
problem for firewalls in some bigger

00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,850
companies because they could be quite

00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:59,240
restrictive so we started with limiting

00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:02,030
the HTTP Essex's for the API in the

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,910
beginning which was like a test of how

00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:09,260
users will react we didn't really

00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:13,310
receive any complaints about it so we

00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:16,360
moved on and currently there is HTTPS

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,310
requirements for everything in studio

00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:22,070
the only remaining component which we

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,020
will probably migrate to https estas

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:29,060
drive and we plan to do that in the next

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:31,820
few months we also increase the

00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:35,240
performance of the test drive that was

00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:38,060
mainly related to the fact that the new

00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,870
desktop environments require some power

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:44,870
and also some users were complaining

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:47,900
about the speed of this drive so we try

00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,730
to increase the cpu speed as well as the

00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:56,030
amount of ram which is dedicated to let

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:59,090
us drive API is something which we have

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:03,140
from the beginning why I mention it here

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:05,630
is ready to the next slide but I also

00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,850
wanted to remind you about our API

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,430
because it's something how you can

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:13,730
integrate your applications into studio

00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:15,530
and vice versa so you can use our API to

00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:17,630
build something and then you can process

00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,670
it with your application and do

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,670
something else with that so that's quite

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:26,690
useful Anna I think a lot of people find

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,820
that interesting but the thing which I

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:33,550
wanted to mention related to API as a

00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:36,380
new feature is web hooks that's

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:40,190
something like a reverse API if I would

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:42,650
call it that way means that every time

00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:45,800
your build is finished Suzy studio signs

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:49,760
HTTP POST request to your defiant URL

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:52,580
and this post request contains JSON file

00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:55,430
or Jason with the detailed information

00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:58,550
about the actual appliance which was

00:15:55,430 --> 00:16:01,850
built so what it means for you is that

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,350
for example if you use the API to build

00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,300
something else to do you don't have to

00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,660
periodically check if we already build

00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:12,140
that image you just configure the web

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,420
hooks and let's listen when wait for the

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,430
call back and once that's done you can

00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:21,050
do something else with the appliance by

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:22,640
your software now I'm moving to the

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:27,050
third part of the presentation and

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,880
that's how to help us because Suzy

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:32,720
studio has quite some community around

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:36,200
it most of the communities concentrated

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,060
on the mailing list we have so if you

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,590
have any problem with studio or you have

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,660
some feature request that's the best

00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:44,350
place where you can interact with the

00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,390
other users and especially our team and

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:50,360
discuss the possible new features we

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,090
listen to that because it kind of helps

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,430
us to know where to what to focus

00:16:53,090 --> 00:17:00,050
on and where to move with the new

00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:02,540
features there what we also there is

00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:06,110
that we put our complete documentation

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,760
of studio on github that means that if

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,670
you find something back in the

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,650
documentation or you have some some

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:15,949
requests on what to add there you have

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,830
to two ways how to do that first the

00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:21,199
preferred way is to send a pull request

00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:23,750
but if you are not really into reading

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,480
documentation we would be even happy for

00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:28,580
create creating an issue on github and

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,120
then we will try to fix it as soon as

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,120
possible

00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,830
also you can join our team we what's

00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,470
interesting about our team is that we

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,120
are not focus we are not on one place we

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:44,670
are spread all around the world that

00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:50,070
means we have people in Czech Republic

00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:54,780
Germany Bulgaria United States Spain and

00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:57,420
other places that's quite challenging in

00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,990
terms of time zones and cooperation of

00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:04,350
the work but it also means that we are

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:09,480
quite flexible about the location of the

00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:11,730
people who want to join our team so here

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,110
are some positions which we currently

00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:17,640
have open and they are both since our

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:19,710
team consists of people working on

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,230
Susie's 30 as well as both service so

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:24,230
these are from both of these locations

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,260
here are some places where to follow us

00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:30,450
I don't know what's your preferred

00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,680
social network if you don't like social

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,330
networks at all we still have the

00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:37,500
mailing list but you can follow us on

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:39,300
Twitter Google+ and Facebook and now

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,970
what I'd like to do is to do a quick

00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:47,160
demonstration of what can see this video

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:49,790
do and how to build the appliance so few

00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,450
just give me second i will change the

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,450
configuration of the

00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,670
the screen

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:27,690
okay perfect so this is the main screen

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:31,530
of Susie studio after I really logged in

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:35,070
so I already created some appliances

00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:41,280
using open Susie so here's the genome

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:45,030
desktop appliance and I also have some

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:49,110
suse linux enterprise and other distros

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:52,910
so but I will give you the demonstration

00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:57,410
of on this particular one from open suse

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,410
the network will be okay

00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:06,950
okay so this is the start screen where

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:09,740
you can see the basic information about

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,020
the plans here's the software selection

00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,090
tab which I already mentioned and on the

00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:16,100
screen shot in the presentation you can

00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:18,800
select the software repos and configure

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:21,110
these things here you can find the

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,090
detail configuration of the appliance

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:26,380
itself so you can customize the

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:29,840
wallpaper stuff which is started and

00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:34,070
once you start the appliance also users

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,800
groups and stuff like that you can add

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,630
some overlay files and you can build the

00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,210
appliance so if you want to build let's

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:44,540
we were talking about the live CD so i

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:47,450
will just select the ISO image and then

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,310
click built and what happens is that our

00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:52,120
service starts to build that image so

00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:55,820
you can download it quickly so there's a

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:57,050
it will start soon in the meanwhile I

00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,810
will show you that this drive feature

00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:01,250
that means that you can that's the

00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,470
feature which I was talking about where

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,680
you can start the appliance inside the

00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,680
browser

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,210
so we can see that this is running

00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:27,399
inside Firefox and it will boot up

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:29,259
quickly hopefully but yeah it's once

00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:31,000
that boots it should boot into the

00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:33,730
genome we don't descrip environment and

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,259
you can see the exact thing you would

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:40,090
see if you boot it on your own computer

00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:42,820
so yeah I think that that's it so if you

00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:45,220
have some questions to stew I would like

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,620
to answer that and in the meanwhile

00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,039
while this boot so we can see but it

00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,039
really works

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:13,820
I can repeat a question it oh cool it's

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:18,560
working yeah yeah and thanks for the

00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,330
presentation i think i'm using studio

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:24,140
since about one and a half years and

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:26,300
it's a two I really like I think I did a

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:30,350
couple of hundred bills to try and test

00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:32,300
out its really great but i have to say i

00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,450
think the project could do much better

00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:40,400
in terms of bug fixing in terms of

00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:42,860
community handling and so on oh there is

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,110
a there are actually two forums not only

00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,540
the one on souza studio which is Anibal

00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:50,840
forum there's also a one with opensuse

00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:52,610
forums so this confuses first of all the

00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,790
users they don't know exactly where to

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,370
go yeah the responsiveness within the

00:22:55,790 --> 00:23:00,800
forum itself is getting close to zero so

00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:03,100
there are a couple of issues that are

00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:08,590
coming up all the time for example when

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:14,260
13.2 was released as a as a template for

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:17,990
example the KDE live CD or life image

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:20,600
kwin was missing so you can imagine how

00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,360
many users complained about that and I

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,990
don't even know if up to now anything

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:29,960
happened about that second of all I have

00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:32,450
a whole bunch of bucks and also feature

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,270
requests but no idea where to place it

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:37,850
so if you put it onto souza feedback you

00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:40,370
hardly get any reply so if you would

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:43,250
enable for example a section in bugzilla

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:45,650
it would professionally managed the box

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,650
as well as the feature requests yeah

00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,910
that's definitely a good idea we as you

00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:52,250
mentioned we already received some

00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,720
requests for that so yeah that's

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,300
definitely something we should think

00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,490
about that so I'm more holding building

00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:01,280
a live image for for a medical

00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:04,610
application and that I think created in

00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,980
that community some some noise so it is

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,290
a very good tool to promote open zoos

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,620
and Souza studio but on the other hand

00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:14,850
if the community and the tool management

00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:18,060
has that high potential of

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:21,270
provement to say a positive it can also

00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:24,120
destroy a lot so I would really ask and

00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:27,570
request from you to improve in in that

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,690
area especially on the on the studio

00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,280
side and if you need more or if you need

00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,720
to talk on the floor ice I'm happy to

00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,760
help you there that would be cool

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,710
actually because we need to make some

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,630
decisions on what would be the main

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,580
platform and so it would be really cool

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,800
to have some opinions from outside of

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,330
the team about which for him to you sir

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,540
what's the best for the community

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,250
because yeah it's always good to have

00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,790
some feedback from the outside because

00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,790
yeah

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,909
more questions

00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:14,320
so who many of you actually uses a

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:17,889
studio apart from him quite a few

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,620
cool like the she knows anything yeah

00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:25,269
we'll just just just log in and to sure

00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:29,159
that the desktop will be loaded yeah but

00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:32,230
I guess you already saw it on desktop so

00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:35,769
yeah and I guess the belt should be also

00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:37,929
be finished in a couple of minutes so we

00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:39,850
won't wait for that but you already see

00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,669
that the first version was successful I

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:46,269
built so you can be almost sure that

00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:47,950
this wanna go me too okay so I think

00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:50,100
that yeah there's one question over

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,100
there

00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,190
what I was missing to one feature there

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:03,340
I don't know if it's there or just I

00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:06,400
don't know that you can come change

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:09,460
configuration rewrite some configuration

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:13,870
files so that they will be included in

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:16,930
to build yes you can supplement some

00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:19,450
files you can add but they are taking in

00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:22,960
come later I think it it is written

00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:25,360
there so you cannot change yeah well

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,940
actually I don't know if analysts the

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,880
question correctly but you have quite

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:33,160
some ways how to put some of your years

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,550
and modified files there the first

00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,500
option is to use the overlay file

00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:41,380
section here that means that you can

00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,990
select the location permissions of the

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:48,070
target file and put it there you can

00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:50,220
even upload some archives which extracts

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:53,170
them on some places of the file system

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,090
you can also if you are not really sure

00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:56,950
which files you are putting inside the

00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:58,690
appliance but you know that they are

00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,300
generated for example in the first start

00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:03,760
of the desktop environment what you can

00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:05,830
do is to launch the test drive and use

00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,360
the modified files feature there that

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,640
means that you can check the file system

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,680
for modifications and then select which

00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,730
first files you want to put back into

00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:19,200
the appliance does that answer your

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:22,060
question or did I misunderstood what

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,920
exactly you were asking about because I

00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,490
don't remember what I wanted to change

00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:28,960
that time but I want to change really

00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:32,220
configuration file which is taking in a

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,230
calm before it is

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,290
operating there I want to change some

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,390
configuration before so not just up the

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:42,850
file but change that one which is there

00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:46,030
because I try to add the same file Wow

00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:48,580
but it was not taken in the cow ah it

00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,800
was assuming that it was overridden by

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,220
some RPM package earth yes there was

00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,700
some you know there are some standard

00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:02,980
configurations are applied but ok don't

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:04,810
rewrite it somehow yeah well I'm

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,610
thinking about one way how to do that

00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:08,650
it's kind of work around but maybe we

00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:11,080
can look on the particular issue after

00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,660
the talk but what you can also do there

00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:16,630
is a section for scripts which can be

00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,670
run even after the build or on the first

00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:21,100
run of the appliance so you can create

00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,020
some files there but as I say this

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,610
sounds more like a workaround so maybe

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,250
we can discuss this particular issue

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:30,130
after the talk and we can find maybe

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:31,600
some solution but yeah this this is the

00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:34,180
first thing which came to my mind which

00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:36,880
you can maybe use for that but it's not

00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:41,670
really the best way how to how to do

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,670
that so yeah let's talk about it then

00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:51,350
okay so if there are no other question

00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:55,070
I'd like to thank you for listening to

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,770
the talk and if you have something like

00:28:55,070 --> 00:29:00,680
a feed bag or things which you want to

00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:04,070
discuss you can catch me somewhere here

00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:06,710
I will be here for some time so no

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:09,250
problem to discuss anything's there okay

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,250
