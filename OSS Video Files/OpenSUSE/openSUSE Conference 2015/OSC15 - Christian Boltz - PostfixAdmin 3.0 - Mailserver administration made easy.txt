Title: OSC15 - Christian Boltz - PostfixAdmin 3.0 - Mailserver administration made easy
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	PostfixAdmin is a webinterface to manage your mailserver and can manage things like domains, mailboxes and aliases. Besides that, the admin can allow the users to administrate their mailbox or domain - which means the admin can relax ;-)

The webinterface is only half of the truth: PostfixAdmin 3.0 comes with a Commandline client ("CLI") which can be used to create, edit or delete everything you can in the Webinterface. The CLI can be used in interactive mode or from a script with parameters.

Behind the scenes, 3.0 got a nearly full code rewrite. Changing or extending something are now easily possible without changing something in the "official" code. For example you can add an additional field with 5 lines of code, which is then automatically available in the webinterface and the CLI. A custom module is possible with 100 to 150 lines of code - with that, you can manage everything, not only mails.

The talk gives an overview on the webinterface and the CLI and shows how you can easily add a field. Finally I'll show how to integrate PostfixAdmin in the postfix configuration.
