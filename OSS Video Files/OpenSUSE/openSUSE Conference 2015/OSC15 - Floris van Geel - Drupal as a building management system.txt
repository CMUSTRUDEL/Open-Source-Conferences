Title: OSC15 - Floris van Geel - Drupal as a building management system

Description: 
	As we all know, Drupal is great for building web platforms, but now we can also manage real buildings with it. Not just facilitation management with modules as rooms or availability calendars, but the actual building itself. This is done with a Building Information Model (BIM) in which all the geometry and relevant metadata for constructing the building is stored. We’ve been able to expose this information to Drupal and allowing to fully utilise its CMS capabilities.

This research initiated from the DDSS2014 (http://www.ddss.nl/) conference in August 2014 at the Technical University Eindhoven. It contributes to the development of IFC based web applications in practice and demonstrates a way of linking machine to human readable data, thus making the data accessible to people without the knowledge of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software.

The next step is the mapping the building’s IFC data to the semantic web, exposing the buildings by means of RDFx and SPARQL to search engines and other web systems.
