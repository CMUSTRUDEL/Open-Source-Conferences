Title: OSC15 - Floris van Geel - Drupal as a building management system
Publication date: 2015-05-04
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	As we all know, Drupal is great for building web platforms, but now we can also manage real buildings with it. Not just facilitation management with modules as rooms or availability calendars, but the actual building itself. This is done with a Building Information Model (BIM) in which all the geometry and relevant metadata for constructing the building is stored. We’ve been able to expose this information to Drupal and allowing to fully utilise its CMS capabilities.

This research initiated from the DDSS2014 (http://www.ddss.nl/) conference in August 2014 at the Technical University Eindhoven. It contributes to the development of IFC based web applications in practice and demonstrates a way of linking machine to human readable data, thus making the data accessible to people without the knowledge of Computer Aided Design (CAD) software.

The next step is the mapping the building’s IFC data to the semantic web, exposing the buildings by means of RDFx and SPARQL to search engines and other web systems.

welcome all of you to the opensuse

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:10,800
conference I'll be giving you a

00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,769
presentation about what we've done for

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,640
the past one and a half year at zero

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:24,260
40-lap in Eindhoven where we managed to

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:29,070
link building information to web systems

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:31,830
in a brief the table of contents it's

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,040
about building information models so

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,530
nowadays these giant buildings they are

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,399
drew up by the architect and the

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,070
constructors etc and they have a 3d

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:48,270
model with enriched with loads and loads

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:52,110
of metadata and this metadata is very

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:55,460
important for the development of the

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,710
building but also where we see for

00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,340
maintaining the building also be talking

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,619
about life cycle industry foundation

00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,080
class how these objects are specified

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,310
the method that we use in order to

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,350
utilize this information in the CMS and

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:19,229
the results and of course future

00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:22,439
development so what is BIM BIM is in

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:26,189
building information model it's a

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:30,119
digital representation of a certain

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:33,829
scope in a certain context for of a

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,829
building existing now and in the future

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,820
some say that it is a process some say

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,360
that is it is a philosophy you have to

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,329
think BIM some say that it's all about

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,329
collaboration and other say that it's

00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,310
just data the last ones who say that

00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:57,360
it's all about that are those are the

00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:01,590
smart ones but all of these people they

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,710
agree it's all about software so why do

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,010
you need BIM this in the same process as

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,890
we've had a

00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,440
in software development the arch text

00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:14,500
here and the contractor he has an idea

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,710
he throws it over the fence and the arch

00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:19,960
checked he catches it he draws it up

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:23,800
throws it over the fence and the

00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,600
engineer sees it we have to make some

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,710
changes then he throws it over the fence

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:34,030
again and then the contractor will drew

00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:36,520
dry up we'll draw new plans and throw it

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,190
over the fence and then the Builder will

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,590
actually build it and we've seen this in

00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:46,180
software engineering as well that in

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,790
previous years ksenia it was a waterfall

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,310
structure where first design came along

00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:56,770
etc etc etc this is not so efficient

00:02:53,310 --> 00:03:02,080
since if you look at this curve then you

00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:04,570
see that the the more you can check

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,260
adapt with your design and your

00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:10,720
processes to new requirements or to

00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:16,030
changing circumstances the more

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,940
efficient you are so normally the

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:21,220
building industry is somewhat slower

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,220
than for example the computer industry

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:27,310
and they're now adapting this so that's

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:33,220
why we need a building information model

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:36,280
and then some other smart people came

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,489
along and they said why should this

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,650
building information model be something

00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:44,650
that is utilized by the big software

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:49,470
vendors that shouldn't be the case it

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:52,570
should be open so the building smart

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:57,519
Association they got all the vendors

00:03:52,570 --> 00:04:03,340
together and they made up the open BIM

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,380
standard so why you need open BIM it's

00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:10,150
an open standard for exchanging

00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:15,030
information objects are hierarchy

00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:19,060
enriched with metadata all files are

00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,280
universally readable which is in normals

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,710
in all the source we we know that

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,139
everything is readable but if you look

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,780
at cat applications and 3d building

00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:33,490
applications then all the exchange

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:35,530
formats are closed in format and you

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,430
don't have a vendor lock-in but it's

00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:44,080
something I don't have to explain here

00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:49,419
looking at that we want to incorporate

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:52,270
the whole cycle that's a building goes

00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:57,070
through the whole life cycle initially

00:04:52,270 --> 00:05:02,039
we will focus on the operational

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:05,610
management part while all these

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,490
buildings are true up in 3d models and

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,169
before they were on the the architects

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:15,039
z-drive when arrested for the rest of

00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:18,510
the life however the contractor the

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,250
owner of the building he paid for it so

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:25,300
why not use it for operation and

00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:28,360
management after that smears going to

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,810
get a head start up with the design and

00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,199
planning since that's easier to sell it

00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:41,590
facilitates and we're still looking for

00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:45,270
parties to partner up with in order to

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,510
make the actual building process

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:51,849
mappable and if you do that if you have

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,280
the life cycle of the building then you

00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:57,669
actually know at the end when it's going

00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,310
to be there torn apart what the rest

00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:02,760
values are of all the elements in the

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,760
building so

00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:10,400
one of the main goals that we have is to

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:14,330
democratize this building information

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:18,490
model so not only people who are experts

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:22,550
in building engineering or cid

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:25,610
computer-aided drawing can use it but

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,290
also people who own the building people

00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:32,990
behind the service desks etc they can

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,420
interact with the model of the building

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,150
and therefore even interact with the

00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,550
building so we want to make it very

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:45,800
accessible and therefore we introduced a

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,140
BMS which is actually you have a CMS

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,880
where you mention content and we threw

00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:52,280
away to see and put in the B for the

00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:58,760
building and then we have a BMS building

00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:01,070
management system since I'm a Drupal

00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:05,570
entrepreneur from 2010 I deliberately

00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:08,770
chose Drupal for it's one of the most

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:12,920
flexible and extendable open source

00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:15,440
content management systems which means

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,370
if we have a link between all this

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,800
metadata in the building then we can

00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:25,280
easily extend that with all the power

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,710
that comes with the drupal CMS for

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:34,610
example issue tracking discussions

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:37,000
calendars calculations workflows etc etc

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,000
etc

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:48,430
and once you have this this link data

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:55,510
then you can enrich enrich these models

00:07:48,430 --> 00:08:01,090
and make them more complex initial the

00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:03,420
initial project will be to have a 55

00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:07,870
year life cycle planning that's what

00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:10,600
most owners want they want to know for

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,000
becoming 50 years that or 30 years that

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:16,510
the building exists how can I make it as

00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,270
profitable as possible so of course we

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:22,210
go for the low-hanging fruit first

00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:26,350
however you can also think about energy

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:31,300
efficiency cost management life-saving

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:37,410
safety and risk management and together

00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,410
with a friend of us we want also after

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,729
taking track of the whole cost and life

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:44,530
cycle through the other life the

00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:53,020
building we want to reuse all these

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:57,190
materials for example this it's wall

00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:59,740
made out of keys of a keyboard so you

00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:02,680
have rest material and you can reuse

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:05,800
that in design but also in new buildings

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,140
and what we're going to do is make a map

00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,370
first of the Netherlands but later on

00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:15,430
Germany etc where you can find this rest

00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:21,340
material and subscribe to reuse it for

00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:22,840
your project the next step if you have a

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:28,150
building model and a building

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:31,930
information service and a BMS to manage

00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:35,500
this data then you can take this data

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:38,110
out of it and put it in a big data cloud

00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:41,640
and then project it back onto the city

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:47,450
which is very interesting for

00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:51,750
municipalities but also for people who

00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:57,510
escorted who have more than two

00:09:51,750 --> 00:10:01,620
complexes and investigated some

00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:08,520
techniques for example the open industry

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:12,300
cesium and some other 3d city generating

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:14,520
tools in order to see which ones are the

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:19,580
most suitable to do that and recently I

00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:22,320
found visi cities which is a UK project

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,230
where they take openstreetmap vector

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,200
data and then utilize the height factor

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:34,130
to that and to my liking that's one of

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:40,160
the biggest come one of the biggest

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,160
challenges to take this sorry

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:46,840
and I did take the the flats

00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:50,290
openstreetmap curves and then you just

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,020
give it a height mapping to that and the

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,840
next step will be to use the dutch AE

00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:58,210
chen heights point cloud data and then

00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:02,490
take little slices like a pancake and

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:06,190
then you have 3d cities that's awesome

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:12,430
so the industry foundation class that's

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:17,110
the readable human readable standards

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:20,620
which has that this element is a wall or

00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:22,780
slab or a flooring and it's either

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:26,650
load-bearing or not its internal

00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:28,560
external and it has special elements and

00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,330
test material these are the minimum

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,300
characteristics however the engineers

00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:37,960
and the other people involved in making

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:42,370
designs can add new meta data to that

00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:46,870
and we usually you utilize this ISO

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:52,480
standard in order to get automated at

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:55,120
out and get our stuff working as a

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,020
backhand we use a BIM server which is

00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,700
developed by at eno and it's an open

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:08,830
source platform made in Java and it's a

00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:12,430
pretty good robust system however it

00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:18,000
shouldn't be hung on a public network so

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:23,010
we had to build in proxying inside the

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,010
CMS in order to have it all secure

00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,050
furthermore there is just like SQL there

00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,370
is a BIM ql that you can query the

00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:35,410
buildings for example give me all the

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:42,610
windows on the third floor that are

00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:45,580
faced east since the ones north usually

00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:50,350
don't deteriorate as hard as the ones in

00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:55,850
east and west and south of course

00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:59,180
then there is a collision format mother

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:04,430
open standard which is XML and which has

00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:06,800
at that point in the team when you talk

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,660
about a certain objects and you have an

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,630
object you have a camera point on that

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:18,950
and i can easily link that to default

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:22,279
issue queue so what we did we took this

00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:26,180
bin server we took drupal and we just

00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:31,279
hook them together we utilized backbone

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:35,000
MVC and jquery to do that and the

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:40,089
easiest way and for me the most it's the

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,089
most effective way is how is to have a

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:50,000
one-to-many relation so for one or more

00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:54,800
building elements we create one drupal

00:13:50,000 --> 00:14:01,550
page and with that we can utilize the

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:05,620
logic and order planning etc etc and the

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:09,470
first cope is to do the multi-year

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,110
maintenance planning and cost flow which

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:20,680
works in the in Holland according to the

00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:20,680
nen 2767 which just says I'm an inverted

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:31,100
radio radio activity curve so each half

00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:34,430
time then the the level of of the

00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,180
quality goes one step down with an

00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:41,140
atomic explosion it's halftime it has

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:43,880
each time a unit time it's the

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:47,820
radioactivity goes to half but this one

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,910
is just inverted and with that the

00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,150
of the building can say okay this is a

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,570
factor which is really important to me

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:59,940
of course health and safety are usually

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:03,420
on top of the online and I have a

00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:06,840
priority or of one of two however it's

00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:08,730
for some owners it it should not be that

00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,280
important or for some it should be

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,890
really important to have an aesthetic

00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:16,680
aesthetic part of it for example if you

00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,150
have an entrance and you get clients in

00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,880
your building then you then it's really

00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:25,560
important to you and and with that we

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:35,330
can using this law methods we can just

00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:35,330
provide the maintenance planning sorry

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:45,770
so in the end we have a linked web with

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:50,580
the meta data from the building the

00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:52,560
stuff that people put in the CMS and we

00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:56,190
can use little blocks which are

00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:00,870
available in Drupal and expose that as a

00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:06,390
semantic web to rdf X and sparkle

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:10,680
queries etc I don't think I have to

00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:13,740
explain how and what a Model View

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:16,950
controller is so we just use backbone to

00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,460
do that for we got experience on that

00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,490
one and after now it's one and a half

00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:28,110
year but hard work we have some nice

00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:31,230
results and I hope that after summer

00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:33,090
that we can do this complete maintenance

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:41,700
planning so I'm going to show you a

00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:45,840
little demo this is the bbms it's a

00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:48,840
pretty straightforward and let's take a

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,580
simple house so you load in simple house

00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:56,460
and then you can click on elements of

00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:58,150
the building and drill down through the

00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:03,180
object space

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:08,070
and then if you take something like wow

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:15,520
we can get the properties out of there

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:19,360
and from there on fetched I have first

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:23,740
have to select something of course this

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:31,140
is a slightly older demo what we now do

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:34,870
is we just shoot a service at the VMS at

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,120
the building server and get all the

00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:39,630
objects all the ideas and all the

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,550
metadata and then shove all the cars out

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,220
it takes slightly more time and start

00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:54,520
the process but in the end it's far more

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:57,250
flexible so here the ideas of the hopes

00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:02,130
of the objects come above the water and

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:02,130
then you can finalize the links

00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:17,700
after that it's easy to implement a

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:20,370
simple charting and graphics and

00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:26,640
dashboards etc etc all the stuff that's

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:30,450
the management people want so then what

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:34,440
we're going to do afterwards so now we

00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:38,520
are about here and the next step would

00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,200
be to actually link the model the

00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,720
digital model of the building which is

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:46,080
enriched with this metadata with the

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:49,820
real building so if we add simple

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:55,110
sensors and actors inside the building

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:58,110
we can get some real time thing in

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:01,170
between something like no GS since one

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,650
of the downsides of a php-based CMS like

00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:09,090
we use with Drupal is that it's not

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,480
really good in real time processing of

00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:15,330
data so something has to go in between

00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,300
however then you can just see at the end

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:21,150
of the of the of the room that you're

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,030
going to book okay this one was booked

00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,520
but the person who was going to cook it

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:30,120
didn't show up for this time so you can

00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:34,020
just go in and check that it's now your

00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:37,850
room so it leads to more dynamic usage

00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:41,760
of the building itself and a better

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:52,080
overview of what is happening with this

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:55,980
building in relation to is usage and the

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:59,910
short term we want to do facility

00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:03,840
management a project information

00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:07,320
modeling asset management which is also

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:12,090
very important what is where and where

00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,350
do you need it and if you have like I

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,300
said before if you have multiple

00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:17,860
complexes throughout throughout the

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,290
region you can project on a map

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:22,960
how many resources or services are

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,630
needed somewhere then you get things

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,820
like you see in a modern Sim City where

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:34,210
you have this little data pylons and you

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:37,030
can find your optimum results in a long

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,910
term like I said we want central actors

00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:44,370
to be implemented in the building so it

00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:44,370
actually there is a one-to-one relation

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:54,669
when we saw the circle the one where the

00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:59,160
building is actually built is a hard

00:20:54,669 --> 00:21:02,890
part to get a good data and workflow on

00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:05,230
since the contractors and the builders

00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:08,590
they use their own planning software

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:13,030
which is not open and during we didn't

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,980
find yet someone who is willing to work

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:18,130
together as a pilot in order to

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:23,830
facilitate as well and of course big

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:27,309
data another recent event in the

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:32,049
building industry is that there came

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:35,890
along a new standard yay we already had

00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:39,280
a few but the CBN L which is a Dutch

00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:45,780
government funded Institute they're

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:50,559
going to make a semantic model of all

00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:54,130
building infrastructure and City

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,919
engineering terminology and then I

00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:59,830
thought that's interesting since there

00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:03,549
is a lot of communication flaws between

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,860
all these parties in what you call a a

00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:08,410
road or what you call psych work or

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:13,559
whatever is the purpose and the meaning

00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:16,960
of the object at hand so we decided to

00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:22,860
link up with them so push whatever we

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,860
have back and gather their ontology

00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:31,940
so we don't have this just could only

00:22:29,239 --> 00:22:33,889
work if many parties join in and all

00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:39,169
work together and I think it's good

00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:42,399
initiative when we go back to these

00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:45,320
little sensors and elements which are

00:22:42,399 --> 00:22:48,470
inside the building then we have to

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:52,129
consider the nine principles of mundane

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:56,419
computing their first expressed by term

00:22:52,129 --> 00:23:02,179
codes it would web stock 2011 and that

00:22:56,419 --> 00:23:04,220
implies that appliance should not be

00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:06,109
connected to the network in order to

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,499
function so it should be able to be

00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:14,029
unplugged and to the network should be

00:23:09,499 --> 00:23:15,979
used as a progressive enhancement it

00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:21,679
must be really really simple to get

00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:25,489
divided working you should do not

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:29,359
network to amplify a tools core purpose

00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:36,080
but not another web browser or Twitter

00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:39,739
client the most important way to enhance

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:46,330
an object is to make easier to control

00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:46,330
or to understand how it's working and

00:23:47,649 --> 00:23:55,279
the enhanced interface for a network

00:23:51,340 --> 00:24:00,590
enabled device should be whether you

00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:02,989
need it to be and you should be able you

00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:07,940
should be sensitive to the impact of the

00:24:02,989 --> 00:24:10,129
products upgrade cycle and the enhanced

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:15,700
intelligence of the device should be in

00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:18,529
the cloud network and not in device and

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:22,580
the objects should communicate with its

00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:25,669
users in ways that feels appropriate and

00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,739
polite and permanent and last but not

00:24:25,669 --> 00:24:31,249
least it should be possible for the

00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:32,120
enhanced object to respond to the

00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:36,170
actions

00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:40,910
of other objects and other forms of

00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:45,230
online data for that there is a nice

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:50,150
MQTT protocol which is smaller than HTTP

00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:52,190
not sure if you're familiar with it the

00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:59,000
big challenge for us is to implement

00:24:52,190 --> 00:25:01,700
that within the drupal CMS but yeah I

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,550
think there is some better options to

00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:09,730
have a broker in between and just like

00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:15,560
no GS for real-time stuff it's good

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:19,070
connect as a hub this is how such a

00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:24,140
package looks like it's a pretty

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:27,170
straightforward so what we did and where

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:30,740
we bumped against is that it's pretty

00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:35,120
hard to capture expert logic in a

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:38,240
digital system one has to sit beside the

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,240
expert and then look how this person is

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,750
doing their job usually it's just excel

00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:48,200
but sometimes it's more complex and then

00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:51,950
how and what they do that's something

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:56,210
which is yeah some you could say

00:25:51,950 --> 00:26:03,940
universal I IT problem to make this

00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:06,050
flexible and to to incorporate that and

00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,060
for the rest we want to add these

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:12,950
sensors like I said before and have a

00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:16,250
big data projection what all that we do

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:22,390
will be provided as GPL three back to

00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:27,580
the drupal and absorbers i find a nice

00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:31,910
tool to do BPM business process modeling

00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:34,610
approach management and that is oops

00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:37,520
let's went too fast let's Bonita and

00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:39,890
Bonita is a java app and it works with

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,860
these management blocks and

00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,230
mencement block can have its

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,320
functionality so you can link it up to a

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:51,350
online source or it can process the data

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,110
from certain platforms to other

00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:57,560
platforms and I think that these kinds

00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:04,040
of tools are the way to go in order to

00:26:57,560 --> 00:27:08,000
connect expert logic services and see

00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:10,130
masses and other systems the nice thing

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,800
about is that the whole center of it the

00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:16,370
community part is the full functionality

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:24,800
and for the corporate landscape they

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:28,370
build all kinds of services around it so

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:31,850
why do we need this kind of systems with

00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:34,580
Drupal I can easily make linear logic go

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:38,870
for em to be combined stuff however if

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:42,040
there is a if it's nonlinear yeah then

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:45,020
we have to find another solution and

00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:49,520
another important thing is that you

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:53,870
don't need programming in order to fill

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,850
these make these schemes and you can use

00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:59,090
it as a hot pluggable that you have a

00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:02,630
situation with data and not one of these

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:04,670
systems with two and then see with

00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:09,820
different parameters and then see its

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:13,780
results the same ways that with the

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:17,120
translating building logic to IT logic

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:20,360
since we put all the metal stuff to our

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,660
own entities somebody with the knowledge

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,590
of a site builder and the knowledge of

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:29,960
the building engineering backgrounds can

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,660
create this logic so we want to make it

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:38,240
as democratic and as accessible as

00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:39,920
possible this was my talk thank you very

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:51,090
much

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:53,600
are there any questions no questions can

00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,600
I ask a few

00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:12,650
sorry

00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,979
we

00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:59,490
linked data approach which one has the

00:29:55,890 --> 00:30:02,760
focus in the current project and at this

00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:05,940
time it is mainly to do a information

00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:08,039
based approach to facilitate the owner

00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,580
of the building in its long-term

00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:16,350
lifecycle planning from there on it will

00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:20,279
be keeping to be for facility management

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:24,270
all those kind of processes and once

00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:28,409
this data grows then the information

00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:30,990
part will be very very important however

00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:33,990
what we in the process we talked a lot

00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:38,909
with cost calculators constructors and

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:41,880
other builders and each of them they had

00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:44,299
their own insights and they want to use

00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:50,039
this and a very interior to see astok

00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:52,620
however then it's like we came to that

00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:54,870
is really hard to facilitate that one so

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:59,309
that's why the little tail came along

00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:01,460
which at first hand doesn't appear to

00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:04,020
have anything to do with the rest of it

00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,230
but in the end if you want to combine

00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:10,289
this all and make it a bigger hole then

00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:13,710
you need this kind of systems and I

00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:15,890
looked around around a lot to replace I

00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:20,460
always want to have one or two

00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:23,880
alternatives to a block but at this time

00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,610
it's not really possible to exchange

00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:31,740
business logic systems with something

00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:35,220
non Java and the same goes for a CMS

00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:38,730
with huge possibilities that is not

00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,000
based on PHP does this answer the

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,000
question

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,500
sort of

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:54,940
yes

00:31:50,659 --> 00:32:01,059
the cool thing is that each

00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:07,099
self-respecting cat package can export

00:32:01,059 --> 00:32:09,379
industry foundation class text files and

00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:12,049
there's also one of the main assets of

00:32:09,379 --> 00:32:17,119
the people from building smart that they

00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:19,159
involved all these cats manufacturers to

00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:25,549
work together in order to make a good

00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:28,309
standard so in the end it can be an

00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:31,039
intermediate format for example if you

00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:33,379
have one should always name to else's

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,080
commercial if you have Autodesk and you

00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:38,119
have our key then through this icy

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,299
object you can exchange the whole

00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:40,299
building

00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,629
any other questions

00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,790
thank you very much

00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,180
you

00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,340
here

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,920
with this

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,900
hey

00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,380
