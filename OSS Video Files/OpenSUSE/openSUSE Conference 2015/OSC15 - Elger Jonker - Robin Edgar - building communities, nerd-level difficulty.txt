Title: OSC15 - Elger Jonker - Robin Edgar - building communities, nerd-level difficulty
Publication date: 2015-05-03
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2015
Description: 
	After years of visiting LAN parties and similar geek events Elger decided to help nerd and geek organizations. This was home, it made him happy. Building communities has been one of his main challenges: getting the right people together to do great things. It appears to be very difficult, and even more so if you are a geek.

In this talk Elger will showcase lessons learned of his travels in building communities of geeks and nerds.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,910
good morning everybody I'll take the

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,570
next half hour to talk a little bit a

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,549
little bit about building community

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:18,180
because some people think that I

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:20,310
actually can build communities and i

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,410
will tell a little bit of about the

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,539
communities that I've been in and I

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:32,759
maybe might a little bit provoke you

00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:36,200
just to get your thoughts running on why

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,809
are we here what are we doing and how to

00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:42,690
get other people here the next time too

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:48,030
so the next conference will have trouble

00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:52,890
or triple the number of visitors who am

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,629
i I'm Alfie ochre stitch I'm part of the

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,070
ethical hacking community in the

00:00:54,629 --> 00:01:04,339
Netherlands and I do a lot of projects

00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:08,640
with communities because I love it I

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:10,470
built help building a hackerspace I help

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,049
building a retro gaming foundation

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,080
currently working on a new space I

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:18,930
helped several events and what I wanted

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,040
to do is show you what the community did

00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:25,439
there and why i joined where things

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:30,350
failed and how the community still

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,600
exists today i have only a half an hour

00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,689
first off i will tell everybody that i

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,320
use linux windows and mac OS on a daily

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:42,810
basis they all do things I like and

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,780
sometimes I don't even know what I'm

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,579
using because they all look alike and or

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,670
they all behave in sort of the same way

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:53,040
so that's fine with me sometimes I don't

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:57,890
know if I'm using word open office or

00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:06,060
Google Docs it's all working great so

00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:09,360
well that first off i'm currently 31 and

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,100
my life my real life that i love and

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,510
enjoy started when I was 26

00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:20,470
and how's that possible well at 26 I

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,870
found the community and it was building

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:26,710
and girlfriends about open source

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:29,560
software and hacking and making things

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:32,530
organizing things and whatnot and it was

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:36,130
called hacking at random it was in the

00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,500
Netherlands and the reason i joined is

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:41,230
that i could do things that matter i

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,320
could change things that matter in my

00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:48,360
own pace like I learned to use media

00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,860
wiki software and changed everything and

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,780
everything I did was like wow this is

00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,020
cool this is cool I can make this better

00:02:52,780 --> 00:03:01,680
I can make this better and that gave me

00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:05,050
a lot of confidence and also that yeah I

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,330
felt at home and I stayed there I stayed

00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:11,230
in that community I am still in that

00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:14,530
community as of today from this event

00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:17,170
which which was an event of about 2,000

00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,570
people two and a half thousand people an

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,290
outdoor hacker camp with all kinds of

00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:25,300
tents and facilities the idea came that

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,120
we needed hacker spaces in the middle in

00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:31,300
the Netherlands and what we did we were

00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,850
a friend of mine said what we want to do

00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:39,120
one in RM as well I was living near

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:41,680
Arnhem at a time and I said sure why not

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,900
not thinking of any of the risks

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,750
involved not thinking of any of the

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,540
responsibilities it was just I wanted to

00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,120
do this and it made me happy so heck 42

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:54,190
was born and after a few years of

00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,220
development they have a large building

00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:59,560
this is the hackerspace the entire

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:03,270
building and what they're doing there is

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:09,220
making hacking having a lot of fun

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:11,350
enjoying each other's company and just

00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,400
it's like I think of it as like

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,870
Minecraft for adults it's like in

00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,520
Minecraft you can place blocks

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:21,130
everywhere everybody knows the game

00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:25,320
probably but this is more than adult

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:28,020
edition where you can build new rooms

00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,960
with stuff that is typically to the

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,430
rooms like a hacking lab or a soul

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,300
during lab with all the right equipment

00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,010
and that the really goal is to like make

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,500
a new room and fill it with all the

00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:42,720
great stuff that you want and then move

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,330
on to the next one for a lot of people

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,400
there if this is even though they don't

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,970
know if this is what they're they are

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,130
there and I am there as well to do that

00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,930
like if there's a gaming room okay we

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:57,510
need these games we need this stuff we

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,010
do stuff and we will source it and the

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,220
hunt is like to get all these stuff

00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,680
together and well we found each other

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:09,000
there in that in doing that and we have

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,580
a lot of other projects there so this is

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,010
a part of the community we haven't like

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:18,150
they're their own identity with these

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,370
lab coats their own chairs of course

00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,230
they made their own chairs and that's

00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:24,450
there's a lot of things that they made

00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,900
for themselves or for people to show

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:32,340
what they do so that's a community that

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,280
I'm part of I left this community to

00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,510
move on to the next project and I was

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:42,930
looking around to see what could I do

00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:45,720
and this came along and this is a

00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:49,020
special project this is a hackerspace

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,110
that was intended to be on the Canary

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,400
Islands so subtropical climate at

00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,310
tickets from the Netherlands to the

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,860
Canary Islands are like 30 euros so it's

00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,910
affordable to be there once in every one

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,620
month or two months but the thing was I

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,810
then I would again invest in the

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,890
community and I would waste a lot of

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,630
time on it to make it perfect but there

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,960
was something strange about this the

00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,910
pitch was about money it was about if we

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,190
have ten euros we can do this if we get

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,560
20 euros we can do this like small

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,440
amounts if you can have 10k we can do

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,010
this but the community is not about

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,780
money nobody cares everybody in a

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,840
community is prepared to travel miles

00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,600
and miles on their own expense just to

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,440
be part of this community so that's that

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,790
there was a strange one and

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,370
so they had laws like there was a text

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:50,410
pet and on the text pad there were laws

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:53,470
and if you wanted to change the law you

00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,050
change the text beds so if anyone has

00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,560
ever been in an edit war on Wikipedia

00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:03,160
knows that this not this does not work

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,190
so the one that shouts loudest wins and

00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:08,530
this is not how evil the community it

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,420
was like really top-down really like

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,740
there are some people that shout really

00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,710
loud and rest just sucks the thing to

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,970
take away and you might have heard this

00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:22,210
everybody who thinks they can make a

00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:25,380
decision usually cannot make a decision

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:29,080
they should outsource it to people that

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,060
might see themselves as as well I'm not

00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,550
sure and that he'll have more doubts

00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:38,200
they have more they take more time to

00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:41,170
make their decision it's not always true

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,330
of course but if there's somebody that

00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,570
that says we have to do this at this and

00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:49,660
this and this maybe that's a good leader

00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:52,930
but maybe he also wants to do too much

00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:57,160
he wants to be too important and this

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:59,740
everybody should be as important so

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,050
another case where things happen that

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,260
that showed sign of community was at a

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,020
festival called hm 2013 this was a

00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:11,140
hacker conference and on this hacker

00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:13,930
conference the crew and everybody

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:18,850
involved in building this the conference

00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:21,010
was really really a burned down to the

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,630
teeth like they were grinding and

00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,580
grinding and grinding to get his done

00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:28,230
and on the final days of the event

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:31,000
everybody was dead and they still had to

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:33,460
turn down a whole festival everything

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,930
that could go wrong was going wrong even

00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,409
though we did it correctly in the years

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:40,060
before and after everybody died and

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,640
nobody could move anymore and everybody

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:47,650
was crying and sad four years later

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,410
everybody still wanted to make a

00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:52,000
conference again it does not make sense

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,830
so if you torture

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,830
entire community or the community

00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,920
tortures itself then they still want to

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:03,220
do it again for some reason and I still

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,660
do not know why I still do not know why

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:14,290
I do want to be part of this group I

00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:17,940
don't know a very short of time I will

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:21,280
skip some things i'll skip some things

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:23,320
one of the things you have to solve in

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,230
building a community is communication

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,200
communication is extremely difficult for

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:31,270
me as a nerd i cannot really communicate

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,210
that well i might be standing here on

00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:37,270
stage but for me to write a sample text

00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:40,360
that is inspiring or that gets people

00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:42,460
going is like a day work days work some

00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,110
people can just write it you have to

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,350
find these people that just write it

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,300
down I can't but communication is

00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,610
extremely important in everything you do

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,880
for example the ohm conference everybody

00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:57,100
was tired and everybody nobody could

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,560
duty and anything anymore so they needed

00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,110
more people but nobody had the idea that

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,830
they had to write a blog post or use

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:09,070
social media or call their friends I

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:12,720
don't know why so communication even the

00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:15,670
easiest form of communications is gold

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,070
now I started building a new community

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,800
it's called the awesome space the space

00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:22,660
in youth react and what we did was we

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,400
made a website we have this we have this

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,640
we have this we have this video and

00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,980
nobody came we have all the cool stuff

00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,320
we have all the cool gadgets we have

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,230
everything that's fun and with that we

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:38,950
love but nobody joined the website was

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:42,310
very unappealing and still not really

00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:44,589
appealing today so we sat down and we

00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,570
thought we have to change it we have to

00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:48,280
build a community this problem is still

00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:52,060
ongoing right now we have to build a

00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:54,790
community otherwise we will go under we

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,580
cannot do this awesome stuff we love so

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,370
a friend of mine came to me and he said

00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,300
I

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:04,850
have a movie a clip and this might help

00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:06,560
you in building your community this

00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:11,270
might help you in doing the right thing

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,830
and I watch the clip and it was the best

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:18,250
thing I've seen in half a year I was

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:20,720
nearly crying like oh wow this is great

00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,420
and some of you might have heard of it

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:28,130
it's by simon Sinek it's the golden

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:32,150
circle and it clearly explains a lot of

00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:34,910
things and it explains egg basically

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:38,510
what you should communicate and it

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,700
explains also if you communicate this

00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,040
correctly you can build a community you

00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,990
can build a product you can build

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,650
virtually anything you want but you have

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,570
to do it in a certain way and so we have

00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:52,640
a presentation inside a presentation I

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:55,900
will show five minutes of his TED talk

00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:59,120
of 2009 it's really awesome and I

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:02,420
encourage you all to just youtube or

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,730
whatever his name and you will come up

00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:07,130
with lots of more great stuff that will

00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:11,120
help you build the community so it's

00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:16,250
five minutes for Simon this is made in

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:19,490
PowerPoint so blue screen pending here

00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:22,310
we go there's a pattern as it turns out

00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:23,870
all the great and inspiring leaders and

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,100
organizations in the world whether it's

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,350
apple or Martin Luther King or the

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,920
Wright brothers they all think act and

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,580
communicate the exact same way and it's

00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,130
the complete opposite to everyone else

00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,820
all I did was codify it and it's

00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:43,690
probably the world's simplest idea I

00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,690
call it the Golden Circle

00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:57,290
why how what this little idea explains

00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,630
why some organizations and some leaders

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,610
are able to inspire where others aren't

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,350
let me define the terms really quickly

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,540
every single person every single

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:09,080
organization on the planet knows what

00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:10,970
they do one hundred percent some know

00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:12,590
how they do it with you call it you're

00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,350
differentiating value proposition or

00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:17,480
your proprietary process or a USP but

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,570
very very few people or organizations

00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,520
know why they do what they do and by why

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,770
I don't mean to make a profit that's a

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,510
result it's always a result by why I

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:29,330
mean what's your purpose what's your

00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:33,290
cause what's your belief why does your

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,330
organization exists why do you get out

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:38,300
of bed in the morning and why should

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,380
anyone care well as a result the way we

00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,360
think the way we act the way we

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,370
communicate is from the outside in it's

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,620
obvious we go from the clearest thing to

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,480
the fuzziest thing but the inspired

00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,910
leaders and the inspire or inspired

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,640
organizations regardless of their size

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:56,050
regardless of their industry all think

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,940
act and communicate from the inside out

00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,200
let me give you an example I use Apple

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,080
because they're easy to understand and

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,870
everybody gets it if Apple were like

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:08,690
everyone else a marketing message from

00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:11,330
them might sound like this we make great

00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:14,720
computers they're beautifully designed

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:19,070
simple to use and user friendly wanna

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,600
buy one man and that's how most of us

00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:21,980
communicate that's how most marketing is

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,090
done the time of sales done and that's

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:25,460
how most of us communicate in to

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:26,630
personally we say what we do we say how

00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,550
we're different or how we better and we

00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,680
expect some sort of behavior or purchase

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,990
about something like that here's our new

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,460
law firm we have the best lawyers with

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,810
the biggest clients we have you know we

00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,640
always perform for our clients do

00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:39,830
business with us here's our new car it

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,440
gets great gas mileage it has you know

00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:45,170
leather seats by our car but it's

00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:50,060
uninspiring here's how Apple actually

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:53,150
communicates everything we do we believe

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:56,510
in challenging the status quo we believe

00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:58,280
in thinking differently the way we

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:00,500
challenge the status quo is by making

00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,350
our products beautifully designed simple

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,779
to use and user friendly we just happen

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:07,529
to make

00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:08,879
Computers want to buy one totally

00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:10,949
different right you ready to buy a

00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,600
computer for me all I did was reverse

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:14,370
the order of the information what it

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,350
proves to us is that people don't buy

00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,939
what you do people buy why you do it

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,120
people don't buy what you do they buy

00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:23,879
why you do it this explains why every

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,709
single person in this room is perfectly

00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,660
comfortable buying a computer from Apple

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,120
but we're also perfectly comfortable

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,660
buying an mp3 player from apple or a

00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,189
phone from apple or a DVR from Apple but

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,420
as I said before Apple's just a computer

00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:38,129
company there's nothing that

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,779
distinguishes them structurally for many

00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:41,850
of their competitors their competitors

00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,309
are all equally qualified to make all of

00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:45,809
these products in fact they tried a few

00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:47,939
years ago gateway came out with

00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,379
flat-screen TVs they're eminently

00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:50,910
qualified to make flat-screen TVs

00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:59,579
they've been making flat screen monitors

00:15:50,910 --> 00:16:03,240
for years nobody bought one Dell came

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:05,160
out with mp3 players and PDAs and they

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,660
make great quality products and they can

00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:09,629
make perfectly well designed products

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,709
and nobody bought one in fact talking

00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:13,019
about it now we can't even imagine

00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,279
buying an mp3 player from Dell why would

00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,220
you buy an mp3 player from a computer

00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,689
company but we do it every day people

00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,420
don't buy what you do they buy why you

00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:23,399
do it the goal is not to do business

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,279
with anybody with everybody who needs

00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,420
what you have the goal is to do business

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:32,430
with people who believe what you believe

00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,860
here's the best part none of what I'm

00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:37,170
telling you is my opinion it's all

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,199
grounded in attendance of biology not

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:41,670
psychology biology if you look at a

00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,350
cross section at the human brain looking

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:44,819
from the top down what you see is the

00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,160
human brain is actually broken into

00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:49,769
three major components that Carly

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:52,199
perfectly with the Golden Circle our

00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:55,110
newest brain our homo sapien brain our

00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:57,809
neocortex corresponds with the what

00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:59,309
level the neocortex is responsible for

00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:02,670
all of our rational and analytical

00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:05,100
thought and language the middle two

00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:06,839
sections make up our limbic brains and

00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,510
our limbic brains are responsible for

00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:12,569
all of our feelings like trust and

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:15,089
loyalty it's also responsible for all

00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:16,169
human behavior all decision-making and

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,809
it has

00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,850
capacity for language in other words

00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,220
when we communicate from the outside in

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,199
yes people can understand vast amounts

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,209
of complicated information like features

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,340
and benefits and facts and figures it

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:30,989
just doesn't drive behavior when we

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,700
communicate from the inside out we're

00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:35,340
talking directly to the part of the

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,470
brain that controls behavior and then we

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,570
allow people to rationalize it with the

00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,179
tangible things we say and do this is

00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:44,279
where gut decisions come from you know

00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:45,690
sometimes you can give somebody all the

00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,519
facts and your figures in these I know

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,129
what all the facts and details say but

00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,749
it just doesn't feel right why would we

00:17:50,129 --> 00:17:53,070
use that verb it doesn't feel right

00:17:51,749 --> 00:17:55,289
because the part of the brain that

00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:57,239
controls decision-making doesn't control

00:17:55,289 --> 00:17:59,009
language and the best we can muster up

00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:00,720
is I don't know it just doesn't feel

00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:01,739
right or sometimes you say you're

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,210
leading with your heart or you're

00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:04,830
leading with your soul well I hate to

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,090
break it to you those aren't the other

00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,100
body parts controlling your behavior

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,480
it's all happening here in your limbic

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,309
brain the part of the brain that

00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:16,649
controls decision-making and not

00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:18,389
language so well that's pretty clear so

00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:21,899
if you want to build a community you

00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:23,369
should be talking about why and there's

00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:25,950
no language for that so you have a

00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:29,669
really big problem there good luck with

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:33,299
that so the thing is why why are you

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:36,299
doing things and to prevent copy-pasting

00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:39,179
behavior like I did it this mistake I

00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,879
have also included a small product video

00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:45,809
of a company that makes a product and

00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:49,440
they do exactly this exactly a copy of

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:51,899
this strategy they just just count the

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,609
number of facts and figures in there in

00:18:51,899 --> 00:19:01,429
their marketing stuff you come up with

00:18:56,609 --> 00:19:01,429
zero here we go

00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:09,560
no shaman that is good

00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,790
the XM 42 is the world's first

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,830
commercially available handheld

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:24,080
flamethrower it's a culmination of ideas

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,520
tossed around since 2007 we wanted to

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,230
make something fun that looked and

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,880
performed awesome using high-grade

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,310
materials in construction and wiring

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,630
provides a stable and reliable device we

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,100
want to bring something to market that

00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:36,950
represents what a real flame thrower

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,840
should be we need your support to fund

00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,160
the various phases of production your

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,900
contributions will help us obtain

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,670
production tooling and machining

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,890
agreements as well as components for

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:47,390
continuing our date with the help of

00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,890
local machine shops we were able to

00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,170
bring the design to reality with a

00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,570
quality working prototype now it's time

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,040
for production we're continually working

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,080
to improve and intend to conduct further

00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,570
are indeed to ensure we produce the most

00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,940
efficient reliable and safe product

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,860
possible our goal is to bring fun and

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,060
awesome products into the world the X

00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,060
142 is just the beginning

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,520
thank you for checking out our IndieGoGo

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,560
campaign and please consider donating to

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,510
this awesome cause and even if you can't

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:23,590
donate you can still help by sharing the

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,590
video and getting the word out

00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:36,330
so it's funny their goal is to make fun

00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:38,910
and awesome projects that's totally

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,500
subjective and they don't say anything

00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:45,690
about how many how much the acid uses

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,450
what the size of the flame is they don't

00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,970
say anything about any they say

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,010
high-grade steel I don't know what that

00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,960
is what kind of Steel is that so they

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:59,340
didn't say anything about the product

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,070
that it didn't say anything about what

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,330
they're actually delivering you accept

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,600
that it is awesome and all these

00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,490
emotional things and people have fun of

00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,720
this campaign because while everybody

00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:16,680
wants a flamethrower don't you so so

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,270
that's how how it works if there have

00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:20,730
been many there are many many examples

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:24,390
just pay attention to FB product release

00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:27,450
on the planet they all try to do it like

00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,430
this they will say nothing about the

00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:33,960
product they will say everything about

00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:36,780
why they do it and how complex it was

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,920
and that they built the greatest thing

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,380
in the world and everything and

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,450
everything so in all of that spectrum

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:46,040
you still have to be unique and I think

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:48,630
it's possible so for the awesome space

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:51,630
one of the projects I'm working on right

00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:54,870
now we changed everything we changed

00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:56,550
like the entire message to buy and after

00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:59,580
two days of writing and writing and

00:21:56,550 --> 00:22:04,050
writing I still feel that it not only me

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:06,330
but everybody I talk to everybody who

00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:09,360
worked on this we still failed on it

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,620
except for some really rudimentary ideas

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,970
that we want to make the world a better

00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:17,340
place well maybe that's the case so but

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:19,410
it's really hard to get this right see

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,810
it's really hard to find the Y if

00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,820
there's already a thing if you're

00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:26,040
already invested in something why do you

00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,930
do it it's really hard I couldn't come

00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:31,740
up with it so we we've written

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:33,360
everything and it sucks so we have to

00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,730
rewrite everything again I don't know

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,690
don't know yet what to write but I know

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:42,269
that I should answer the why question

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:44,250
I like to have fun I would like to do

00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:48,659
something that contributes and I'll do

00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:51,179
all the other things for example I can

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,399
mess up an idea that you might all know

00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:56,220
an interstellar travel company it has

00:22:53,399 --> 00:22:59,070
the fastest engine in unit universe 10

00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,559
bar of course 250 group members and high

00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:05,070
risk of death and fatal injuries do you

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:08,370
want to join well if you just write it

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,740
down differently to boldly go where no

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:13,889
one has gone before discovery moves us

00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:15,659
forward challenging ourselves and we

00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:19,830
love exploring and if you join now you

00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:22,169
get a free red t-shirt for example so

00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,000
that's just another way of writing down

00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:25,860
the same things and this actually

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,639
inspires this gives you the freedom to

00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:36,029
do to fill in a thing that you think hey

00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:40,200
this fits I fit so so i looked at the

00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:42,480
open suse website and well of course

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:46,409
it's easy now to say well what's going

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,590
on here I see get it I can get the open

00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:52,080
suse distribution which is great I hate

00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:54,659
clicking download buttons or searching

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:57,529
for download buttons I want if I already

00:23:54,659 --> 00:24:00,570
want it I just click and want to have it

00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:03,120
but the thing was I couldn't find any

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:05,639
reason of why I should use open suse

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,649
linux I'm sorry but I just couldn't and

00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:10,620
that's the case for many many of the

00:24:07,649 --> 00:24:12,690
Linux distributions out there I duly use

00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,509
linux on a daily basis but i use kali

00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:18,090
linux a pen testing distribution because

00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:20,250
it has all the tools that i like and of

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:24,240
course i can install all these tools in

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:25,679
open suse no problem no doubt but they

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,039
already did it for me and they are

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,779
dedicated to bring me the best tools

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,450
that there are in the market I don't

00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,039
have to do anything so i was thinking

00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,350
what what's the target audience why

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,120
should i join the open suse community

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:43,429
why should I help the open suse

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:47,070
community so just for being a total ass

00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:51,570
I've compared open suse linux with

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,550
justin bieber OS bibian and the case is

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,190
clear if you

00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:57,410
on to use if you love Justin Bieber and

00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,260
there are many people that do or Hannah

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,840
Montana or any of bony OS or any of the

00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:04,670
other operating system you there's

00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,880
there's an operating system for every

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,650
problem like fans of Justin people will

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,880
use this operating system it's a great

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:15,680
way to lose to learn linux and unix and

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,330
you can look at pictures of him listen

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,940
to his music get the latest news and

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:22,430
everything so at cater student demand of

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:24,710
young teenagers that want to have linux

00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:28,340
distribution so what does open suse

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:30,920
cater to I have thought of a few ideas

00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,830
but I couldn't find it on the website if

00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:37,880
i look at the opposition website i did

00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:39,980
the thing that was most fun of most the

00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,630
thing that most inspired me was having

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:47,810
fun with a system I know what it is but

00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:49,820
the rest of the world maybe not so it's

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:52,190
very clear where where where we are now

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:54,350
if in terms of communications what it

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,780
has some features I don't know what they

00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:59,740
are how it is an operating system and

00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:04,640
why well you have to fill in that blank

00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:08,690
and I've got a few wise here for example

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:11,360
to wipe out or upgrade windows to power

00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,780
the world to give people more power with

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:17,060
rich immersive PD experience I'm just

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,860
reading out loud to support boring

00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:23,090
businesses in their legacy applications

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:24,440
if you just formulate why are you doing

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:30,020
things you will find the right people to

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:32,840
help building this system so for every

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:36,920
problem there is a Linux so what's the

00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:40,610
problem you saw maybe another tip that

00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:43,820
can help you is some mission and vision

00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:46,310
 from the mission and vision

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:51,290
 generators that can help find

00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:53,800
you the best words take some time to

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,800
read the comic

00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:00,419
one thing it's really important you

00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:03,090
should not lie you should be really

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,570
really honest and you should not be

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:09,149
conformance I've had a company year's

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:11,460
fair yay way way back and we had a

00:27:09,149 --> 00:27:13,260
mission a vision that was identically to

00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,010
all the other companies there just to be

00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:19,019
conforming to the other companies and

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:22,169
well we did some business and it was all

00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:24,059
good but the mission of Asian sucked I

00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:26,880
didn't believe in it it was just there

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:29,370
to look good so you don't have you don't

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,470
want to do that unless you tell

00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:33,450
everybody behind the scenes that we are

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,250
the biggest con operation in the world

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:40,110
and if you want to love conning you

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:43,100
should join us then it works so some

00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:46,980
generators you might click through and

00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:48,809
and you get sentences like this and this

00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,940
dude this does not solve your problem

00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:53,220
like our company exists to quickly

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,230
simplify value edit and parallel methods

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,870
of empowerment globally provide access

00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:01,649
to progressive and multimedia base

00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:04,620
paradigms well cool that's what you do

00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:07,260
but why do you do it and another problem

00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:09,029
or our vision is to continue to

00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:11,179
completely provide access to

00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:13,500
next-generation technology and

00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:15,539
synergistically utilize your people

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:18,029
noise three-point own sources while

00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:19,649
maintaining the highest standards well

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,080
that looks a little bit more like an

00:28:19,649 --> 00:28:25,139
operating system or a website or more

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:27,960
technical but it still does not it says

00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:30,210
what you do but still not how why you do

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,029
it so you have to think why why are you

00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,860
doing this this is just we want to make

00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:37,649
money this is it says we want to make

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,750
money so some pro tips do not use

00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:43,370
passwords they will go out of fashion

00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:46,110
really really quickly mention that why

00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:49,200
do not lie and do not be confirmed if

00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:51,840
you can break anything but you have to

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,919
be truthful so this is a small to-do

00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:00,870
list it has to have a why it has to have

00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:03,090
we want to do this because something you

00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:06,299
and all of the Europeans have to believe

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,910
it you must believe it has to be worth

00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:10,280
your life and your tie

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:12,680
it has to be worth about anything you

00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,290
have to continue working on it and it's

00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:19,220
really hard to formulate exactly that

00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:23,050
sentence and or multiple sentences so

00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:28,070
through honest inspiring passionate and

00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:31,760
maybe get people that are more emotional

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:33,680
and can help you with this for me it was

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,740
really hard and still not done with this

00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:40,480
so thank you for your attention and see

00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,480
