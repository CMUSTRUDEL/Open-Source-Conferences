Publication date: 2011-02-07
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	Nearly all distributions are slowly moving towards making it easier to deal with applications, and get information about those. However, many of us are working in our own corners: unfortunately, this is often what happens with many topics that would move faster if they were looked from a cross-distro perspective.A small team of people from various distributions will meet in January to discuss what can be done in a cross-distro way. This talk will present the conclusions from this meeting, and will come back on the experience of organizing work in a cross-distro way.
