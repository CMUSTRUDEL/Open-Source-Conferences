Title: Example of cross-distro collaboration: Application Installer
Publication date: 2011-02-07
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	Nearly all distributions are slowly moving towards making it easier to deal with applications, and get information about those. However, many of us are working in our own corners: unfortunately, this is often what happens with many topics that would move faster if they were looked from a cross-distro perspective.A small team of people from various distributions will meet in January to discuss what can be done in a cross-distro way. This talk will present the conclusions from this meeting, and will come back on the experience of organizing work in a cross-distro way.

	                              ok so hi everybody there's no battery in                               the microphone anymore so I'm going to                               try to speak loud in fight we can find                               some batter will stop this way and I                               probably have a matter to                               so I'm in vessels I'm an open single sir                               at novell and I'm going to speak about                               the astral project which is a poignant                               project which                                two weeks ago and so I'm going to                                explain what it is about why I think                                it's important and why we are doing it                                in a cross destroy way and how we are                                the region across this route but before                                telling you all that I want you to look                                really with attention at my picture I                                want you to see that so I'm beautiful I                                think that I'm more beautiful than you                                are I want you to see how clever I loop                                and all that and I want you to see this                                picture why I looked really stupid and                                the goal is to make you understand that                                I am accessible you can come to me after                                the disco you can talk to me whenever                                you want it's an email i will try to                                reply to you i will try to have time for                                you so really i don't want people to                                just sit east oak and thank you that's                                communication is involved so what is the                                extreme project the ghostly assume                                project is really to focus on the work                                flow dealing with applications for users                                help in solidification how to find an                                application                                and making sure that from I use a fast                                back to you there is nothing complex                                with that the user doesn't care about                                what is a package for example if you                                install if you look at many solutions                                easily forgive all in debian you can                                have the package that I splitting                                aspirate package because it has no                                picture dependent files and that some                                kind of seven the users really doesn't                                care about he doesn't want to know if it                                requires to package three baggage if it                                requires to install cute or mono or                                whatever you just want to use an                                application Judy doesn't care about                                packages and so we want to deal with                                that and we won't make it easy and                                really then the goal is to answer the                                need for an user when he says I want to                                play to Kimmy five trips on to be I want                                to use firefox inscape whatever but I                                liked used in factors as a good example                                so for the people                                what when people don't listen to me the                                light from the slides this is a market                                if you didn't notice in the first while                                I said across this from way and then I                                put my super City logo and nothing else                                so let me fix that we had a meeting two                                weeks ago people from debian fedora                                MichellePhan Susan boom to we really                                wanted to have this meeting with as many                                people from as we description as                                possible because we wanted to solve this                                issue together and I'm not going to                                explain right now why a processor way is                                better and all that we have going to                                have a second operation after listo I'm                                going to do the bit about how we                                organize this necrosis destroyed between                                those but i'm not going to focus on that                                right now i'm going to talk about                                extreme itself so these are other people                                to attend endure the meeting we were                                   people                                like people come over so after the                                meeting we posted report on growth post                                articles meeting needs and all that and                                we've read the feedback from buyers                                people with red particles in the press                                and all that and then one else playing                                some confusion by some people prolly                                because we didn't think things well soft                                words so let me get a few things                                straight we don't place packages we want                                to build on top of that that's really                                important we don't want to create a new                                package manager we want with something                                that deals with education we don't want                                to have what people what people go and                                that's all for all distributions what we                                want is to enable any distribution to                                have one place when they can have meta                                data applications and we don't want to                                do for people for the solutions to use                                 one unique place                                 and also we don't want revisions to hear                                 everything we think it's good to share                                 but we'll sort of stand that that's some                                 cases where you don't want possible use                                 comments from users normal as a                                 distribution or you might not want to                                 your screenshots from some distribution                                 for one except for example enterprise                                 distributions might want to really                                 control what happens in the efficient                                 center so we really want to just build                                 on top up what we have and provide a                                 good his experience of the product again                                 for people nothing matters anymore                                 decision what I said um so I only have a                                 religion of time frame for of your stove                                 I do quickly over the picture for you                                 well maybe not that deeply this is the                                 the schema that represents Morris what                                 we watching we are three no four parts                                 there is one part which is really how to                                 build some meta data based on what the                                 officials provide already I'm going into                                 el foro pastor there is one part where                                 we ship this winter                                 there's one part the client site consume                                 this meta data and to provide a good UI                                 on top of that useful user and there's a                                 full bath which is really about how we                                 endow metal guitar which doesn't come                                 from implications of themselves but from                                 users that includes ratings comments and                                 all that so very quickly how this all                                 works how we built the the release                                 static method that that is that comes                                 from extreme we believe that as so first                                 what is an application we should define                                 what is an implication we should define                                 a unique way to identify an application                                 across distributions so we've had to                                 roll the jokes about that service which                                 is about that and after if you maybe                                 have not a few half but we enter some                                 time                                                       softer answer some decision we agreed                                 that what we want to use another                                        applications that's the files the reason                                 for that is that applications usually                                 appear in the initial committee and                                 they're only provided like that so we                                 know that the disciplines don't have all                                 the new machine that is needed for what                                 we need right now and we'll have little                                 time there we will help that stream to                                 provide metadata and will change the                                 discipline sophistication to include the                                 fields that we would just to answer some                                 people might think that you know all                                 applications might not have it is so far                                 it's possible to buy for everything so                                 if you think that an occasion right now                                 isn't even a sample should appear in the                                 efficient center just add a distal file                                 for this application that's it so yeah                                 we extract information from this list of                                 files the reason we do it this way is                                 that this is the kind of information                                 that upstream will provide any way for                                 the ball the description of the epic                                 the version of the equity all that kind                                 of stuff it can simply be provided by                                 extreme and so we can simply extract                                 that from the discipline so we put all                                 that in a xml file i'll show you later                                 how it looks back and this xml file is                                 published on the mirrors and as you can                                 see we provide it in half on top of the                                 existing metal so it's two different                                 things we don't mess up with your                                 existing later the time we just had a                                 new file that people can download we                                 also provide iphones so there are                                 several ways to deal with icons in here                                 right now you can just see that we                                 provide a big double with all the icons                                 from all opinions but you can specify an                                 iphone either by specifying a low data                                 to a file or vice Pacifican you are high                                                                                                       this way but such an easy one um and                                 the third person that this app data xml                                 file is consumed by a client so the user                                 with Donnelly's with a clients the                                 clients will push it in xavier in                                 exactly a database so exactly a database                                 for the people don't know it's a really                                 fast read-only database I think I'm not                                 really familiar with it but it's really                                 cool and you can use it and it's not                                 quite well and based on what we've done                                 is exactly in that ways we can display                                 in the supercenter what people can                                 install and what editions are available                                 the software center will use package                                 kids to to install the package that'll                                 need for this application so the                                 proportions are right here of this is                                 currently the window supercenter we                                 think it's a good UI it's not perfect                                 but it's truly a good basis that we can                                 build on top of the reason we want to                                 use package give you that it's cross                                 distribution can walk with all                                 distribution so I think it's really the                                 right way to deal with package the sofa                                 center if people don't know do people so                                 does everybody has seen the software                                 center                                 I'll try to do a short demo yeah                                 watching the show me move because it's                                 really cool it deals with                                 recommendations it's really tries to                                 attract the stuff the user doesn't care                                 about and to provide the information and                                 the last part is the OCS server so OCS                                 is a specification that defines a                                 protocol to to to provide some social                                 features                                                                 that we do OCS protocol we can add                                 ratings comments and additional meta                                 data comes from users and not a circle                                 from upstream for this apparent side                                 something which is not here mention here                                 with the screenshots the center right                                 now is the pre trust of the internet                                 service and we want to do something                                 similar we want to share the screen                                 shots as possible this is being                                 discussed because we also don't want to                                 have everybody views once ever                                 have to do it director so that's the                                 overall it's not a really complex it's                                 not you know really nothing that people                                 couldn't achieve before this meeting I                                 think that it was really important to                                 get all the people together to agree on                                 that see that we have more less the same                                 vision and agree on one picture together                                 so that can walk together of that                                 instead of having people doing something                                 different for that then something                                 different for that and something                                 different for that while we would have                                 in the end for different solutions so                                 that's what I've been back time I need                                 so during the meeting we walk on the                                 architecture but we also wanted to go                                 home with a plan on an outing to mental                                 lapse so we find a fine line which is                                 quite aggressive                                 spoiling too aggressive and you'll                                 probably won't respect it it's always                                 good to have an aggressive timeline put                                 some pressure so the idea is to have the                                 end of april or is it sinking of april                                 by april like remember to publish the                                 meta data so that's the xml this part                                 two of this is published by all                                 distributions it possible we also want                                 to pull the UI so bothersome to Center                                 together distributions so that means                                 having package kids being used by the                                 software center it's naturally that                                 voltage cooling so we think this class                                 should be really doable by July the goal                                 is to integrate the non-static meta data                                 so that's our this parts the bossiest                                 server sorry and so we want to have                                 distribution for wide and UCS error and                                 to have the supercenter understand OCS                                 so that people can publish comments                                 published ratings see what other users                                 think of applications this is quite                                 aggressive few things can be done                                 there's already a CSM roach exist so we                                 just have to walk in each distribution                                 on the passenger side today to deploy                                 that and then should you also add the                                 features too                                 the center and the angle for us right                                 now is to deliver all that producers by                                 November why November that's a bonus for                                 the next distribution cycles so although                                 release that could happen in the next at                                 the end of a we want to do that that's                                 why that is the it can do what's                                 blocking us obviously what's looking at                                 you that you need more time Oh always                                 there are some things to do way more                                 fine and when we went back home after                                 the meeting we all realized that you                                 know we still have tons of stuff to do                                 outside of this so we need more time we                                 need help from people so everybody can                                 join everybody can help the the overall                                 architecture is with the way good                                 probably not perfect but we think we                                 should focus on that not trying to                                 change it all the time so just focus on                                 the infinity of that and people can help                                 for that people can help either on the                                 up which is really cross the troll who                                 can help you come and stuff in their                                 specific distribution like publishing                                 the application meta data on the                                 solution servers another thing which is                                 blocking us in the CLA from Canada cool                                 I'll go we're currently on that right                                 now if you want to contribute to the                                 sofa center you have to sign the                                 contribute all licensed accident from                                 canonical some people don't want to sign                                 it well I'll actually sign if it's good                                 on that but there are people will not                                 sign it anyway and there are people like                                 me work for companies so it's not my                                 decision so this is a blocker for us so                                 we with trying to work with chemical see                                 can be either drugs or change or                                 whatever we try to to fix that but i                                 just want to mention that attention talk                                 strong so yeah and we need you over this                                 kitchen is distributions wailing east                                 its belly we didn't want creating the                                 other of the mailing list and we wanted                                 to do that on the place does it well                                 known for now and it's too high traffic                                 will move to another man mr. so any                                 question on that i have seven minutes                                 for question                                 thank you forgot one block and that is                                 licensing if you distribute all the                                 different items in one giant table you                                 will mess up or different licenses we                                 were in Qatar we tried that already                                 which it was working on that and to                                 Dorothy you blocked it that's that so no                                 can ok so I want them to work with that                                 that's a good point what I'm can do is                                 if it's not possible to put all the                                 icons together we can still turn them on                                 the website but on our dance ever each                                 separately I assume and so you can                                 specify and set up oh that's what I                                 didn't show to you if we're ready yeah                                 for girl takes em oh that's fix mmm so                                 that's how you did is it speaking up yes                                 I suppose that's how you define an                                 occasion in the XML files so that's more                                 or less trivial the icon for that we                                 have several web space find icon so it's                                 either starch which is more or less an                                 icon which is defining and I don't think                                 it can be local which is a look-alike on                                 the pac-                                                                 be you are I in which case it's about a                                 new iphone ipod so it's not possible to                                 to group all icons together we can                                 probably                                 not she that your travel with the light                                 Dawn's and do it separately like I've                                 all items available on a seven dirty but                                 it's probably going to be a bit annoying                                 from a performance perspective so we                                 might have to look down the caches of it                                 we can manage that yes first I                                 understand that it's a passion for                                 interesting                                 just stick to the distribution its                                 operating the comments but I can imagine                                 that                                 users might interest us                                 we're all the distributions so                                 so what we decided that is that it's                                 something each distribution to decide                                 what the policies actually depends on                                 the switch my personal opinion as a                                 contributor to a community distribution                                 it's that we should pull data from other                                 distributions we should pull the data                                 from other distributions too that's my                                 personality sister Beth comment that                                 their architecture day image actually                                 permits to implement all different                                 policies so their architecture enables                                 either to you use the end of a mother or                                 not to use them or you selectively use                                 them but that's a very important point                                 in the LCS protocol actually use that's                                 when specify what you want to fetch you                                 can use more of the servers and data                                 right there we go together                                 konishi a screenshot of the xml format                                 so how do you plan transition you                                 obsessed with that this is structured                                 from the disciplines we don't we don't                                 deal with transitions ourselves so this                                 is extracted for big application next a                                 desktop file is a just little bit of the                                 project it's just a very a desktop file                                 this top five for a big application with                                 a very small part of a project so it's                                 okay for an application no map legation                                 to save this to use a decimal time for                                 very smaller stuff which is interesting                                 for users for example I don't know                                 wallpaper package well there are a lot                                 of the ratio between the work that went                                 on the description and the work that                                 went on the stuff we were with the user                                 with no use is very different so here                                 you hear you say if you want your stuff                                 to appear in the application center just                                 create a desktop file so just before we                                 are under the sessions where I'm fine a                                 moment ago on packet descriptions and                                 from flashes that a is it                                 of of duplication of descriptions in                                 many different formats so it's two                                 things okay let me let me answer                                 everything first you want you examples                                 about the wallpaper it's not enough yeah                                 a lot paper is not an application if you                                 want to do it in selling it wallpapers                                 it should be integrated between the UI                                 that changed to open that's my opinion                                 from a user experience perspective                                 that's what you should but I can agree                                 that you can have small applications and                                 iso file is big enough I think it's                                 still manageable at the sofa is not that                                 big it's not a complex issue trivial to                                 write one and should beat upstream not                                 in the package that's coming back to                                 having different duplication of                                 descriptions and all that so                                 I was the                                 speaker last year with both about the                                 package descriptions and precision hope                                 that I think after thinking model this                                 whole topic for applications this in                                 general the descriptions should go                                 upstream anyway because if you want to                                 share some data to the data we share is                                 upstream it's always a stream so if we                                 need to have to share descriptions I                                 think we should put it up stream that's                                 all it's so it can be in the decimal                                 convinced of somewhere else but in my                                 opinion even if a person is dead then we                                 had talked yesterday about that same                                 stuff I won't say that repeat that that                                 again but yeah I mean what's important                                 that we don't get what everyone should                                 not yeah                                 I made something of a lot of for when in                                 store extracting descriptions from PDF                                 files yes because the format extreme                                 decided we all agree i'm a kid youtube                                 and i hate doing that and we should push                                 this at the upstream so that when once                                 one packet or does it all the packages                                 don't have to do it again that's really                                 if you want to pick to make our life                                 easier push fix upstream that's really                                 your solution yeah amid the beginning of                                 the torture you may or                                 that was the scope of the project techno                                 project the Freedom Project very                                 interested suit against about you are so                                 thanks for the strip let me go back to                                 the image so it's slim atmosphere                                 you so it's a crusty strong project                                 right now this bus oldest part so you                                 move this small part actually everything                                 else is not nonspecific no way the high                                 part what we find us the reference                                 implementation I will take is a                                 phenomena fication the giving people are                                 walking on the KDF occasions which will                                 use all this chip it's called Branson                                 it's part of the Brits and projects so                                 it's not stop specific meaning so it's                                 cross sister all its cross this stuff                                 and right now I wouldn't say it's a free                                 to stop project that because I don't                                 think it means anything that you any                                 other question                                 okay so i can quickly at five minutes so                                 just to transition to the doctor after                                 this one which is club version with                                 Winchester I want to quickly share some                                 experience bulb organism across this                                 from me so I don't know it should read                                 my blog post about that but you've read                                 it we will already have all this                                 information but this cross is from                                 making the Ivy came and the open sea                                 conference back in October and so we had                                 a lot of discussion about creating art                                 and stole marketplace so that kind of                                 stuff okay and we didn't want you to                                 just pray code everything served on the                                 other hand there was people they don't                                 really know you should come back over                                 this fish and all that so I decided to                                 try contacting people because I know a                                 lot of people with mini distribution                                 because I'm or according L am NOT from                                 enthusiam from home so I know many                                 people from winnings and all packages                                 should know many people from overseas                                 missions that                                 so I decided to conduct a lot of people                                 like the week after a difference a                                 conference I was at UTS that was able to                                 talk to Michelle phones about this the                                 soldier center and it was really excited                                 about the idea of collaborating about                                 all that so that's not really cool I                                 send an email to reach out Jews who is                                 working on package gate and was also                                 interest in this topic and it was also                                 really enthusiastic then two weeks later                                 I met Stefano at an event and then I                                 sent him an email and it was                                 enthusiastic about all that and so that                                 was really surprising because the first                                 friction when I said that we should try                                 to organize a meeting from other people                                 while inside the company opens in front                                 was like is it possible is it going to                                 happen you know                                 people won't have to move that and it                                 turns out that if you look like the                                 people if you ask them do it so it's                                 really the perfect and then it's always                                 like how to organize a meeting so we had                                 a list of                                                            good time a good date and so we agreed                                 on all these saturdays and we sense and                                 attention to the descriptions made me so                                 that people we haven't conducted before                                 but also join me they wanted and that's                                 it I mean it was really not that                                 difficult and all the time everybody was                                 really supportive yeah so I think that's                                 really something that we should learn                                 about people want to that if it's a                                 topic that is of interest to them and                                 yeah you know the flatterer but I guess                                 it's time to tune to the manifesto so a                                 late stage for Stefan oh joy                                 thanks
