Title: Improving Rollback in Linux via DSL approach & distributing
Publication date: 2011-02-10
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	Following on from the Distribution Talk at FOSDEM last year the subject of this presentation focuses on Rollback within Linux.Rollback has been around in various forms for many years within GNU/Linux Systems. This talk looks at the current mechanism proposed by Caixa MÃ¡gica Software in collaboration with the Mancoosi Project and how it improves the existing mechanisms. A Domain Specific Language (DSL) that has been specified is being used to describe the way in which package evolution occurs to feed a three-tiered rollback approach. This DSL information, the binary and configuration data of the packages can then be transmitted and stored away from the local machine using various techniques to help record the state of the machine. This distributed information can then be recalled in the event of catastrophe and help restore the state of the system back in terms of packages and configurations to a previous working state using simple interfaces.
