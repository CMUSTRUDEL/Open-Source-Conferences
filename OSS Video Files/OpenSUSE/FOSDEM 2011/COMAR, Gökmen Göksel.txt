	                              hi everyone I want to try to tell you                               today the first project of harvest is                               joy                               it's called Tamar and it's developing                               since                                                      technologies for us but I guess the it                               gives you as new technology                               the project remark was started because                               of the problems in system management                                impoverished Minister so we try to find                                basics of management's we we think these                                titles in our getting the basics of a                                Linux distro modular so we try to find a                                solution for this                                current programs and are listed here                                actually and in of the source world and                                there's a lot of choice to use different                                metals to difference from to solve                                different problems so then for one                                program there's a lot of programs to                                manage it for example there is health of                                drama editor in open source area but                                every solution and it takes it is home                                solution and everybody so I think so                                these two are getting part because of                                the separated and demo processes                                we define some problems and first of all                                each each other has different API and it                                is not easy to make a universal                                interface for some application if you                                are the vignette we have a great                                application something that developers                                like si are getting the operational code                                into the Greek wall so when you try to                                develop them to the marginal this way                                you have to do same things in                                         you make a mistake in somewhere else                                yeah fix other versions of it so it is                                hard to track because the translation                                problems are getting part each                                application comes with own solution of a                                competition for the injustice spur user                                privileges                                and it is not possible to make atomic                                privileges you you just give the control                                of holder bonus but you cannot give the                                just open or on oh no for the light for                                a long course and also                                different types can work on same data so                                the synchronization between these                                applications about this data is getting                                hard                                in this figure you see two application                                somebody it has two different we god                                that's so different clacker and to the                                library two minutes is that actually                                there are similar apps but there is no                                central solution for creating and                                managing students for nice because of                                this we have to write different wing                                code for epics and different we call for                                f                                                                   solutions happen and so it is part two                                minutes                                we try to create the Chamma Chamma is                                common name comment and a family in                                Turkish called troll my second                                configuration manager it's when you                                vomit a lot charge                                we try to focus that all applications                                can carry there's medicine to management                                libraries but we can make a sandwich                                solution and always on this home for                                these are cases camber over the central                                solution so                                you can leave you can do something like                                that                                there is still true application to                                different application there is to                                library to manage these applications but                                there is just one we all one could go                                because each interface uses show bottom                                of that and so mock model is coming in                                comes from the Java package and it is it                                provides the unified API and also trauma                                handles the identification stuff you                                just say that remark start a service or                                stop a service or do something else                                where what you give with Joe marsupial I                                will explain it with an example                                wait it is a sample of Shahada                                it's just example file for example                                there's an interface in this manager and                                Terezin tomatoes get devices it takes                                one argument as devices and its type and                                get worse method get' motto Exley's gap                                and it does its job in a given direction                                of devices you can define that of atomic                                operations in tomorrow does and you can                                 write the secrets that next model is for                                 example land here so different                                 bootloader                                 application grab and below and they have                                 similar management types and they have                                 just one configuration file there is one                                 library ultimate graph file grab from                                 file and there is one learn to manage to                                 the file to different JavaScript that                                 fixes and that much samehada from ours                                 and remark for so much give us and it is                                 not a sir it's running as activation and                                 technology of give us value credit                                 approval applications you just set your                                 heart and reduce which secretly on this                                 model for example you can say get some                                 trees so good manage model on someone                                 with using to up brackets                                 so the in can we stop there is enough to                                 change for different applications you                                 can make a lot of applications that just                                 use the same model and the service are                                 in packages in this packages parts                                 package management is also developed by                                 Polish we call that in each package and                                 has obstacles so that makes the drama                                 mother so you can use each package in                                 secret from tomorrow thereby using the                                 model which provides - one                                 tomorrow for one's health of using                                 possibilities and for example we can go                                 from our home give us you can't go epic                                 its neck winter it is not of these men                                 as you get to us and it gets the same                                 result say operation but using the tone                                 and remark provides a two-tone library                                 you can use it by working Champa this is                                 similar and it's just to say over t bus                                 but it is very easy to write and also                                 there is a shout a possible option to                                 use tomorrow                                 it's safe                                 you pull the package name and you bought                                 the model and the letter it makes quick                                 application easy because you just you                                 you have the unified API which provides                                 the similar output for different                                 packages so it is very easy to handle                                 all this stuff with one application                                 tomorr provides authentication with                                 bulky and for example using magic policy                                 for user message model of tomorrow                                 that's an option for any usage policy                                 yeah                                 so you can't define atomically                                 privileges for niches some users can                                 have users but some one others not                                 that we call remark to do something if                                 it is required to not on state your                                 privileges                                 it calls for attention you don't need to                                 do what on occasion stuff in your                                 vehicle when it is required from our                                 embassy in this example also you see                                 differently there is an oversized                                 package and some packages can provide a                                 service model so when you write it in                                 service package which has demon on it                                 for example Apache mascot or some                                 contractor you just put it on script                                 which start stops and reload the package                                 and                                 in pissah file you say that this is a                                 demon and it provides an openness                                 accessories so then using chalk mark you                                 can say something like that                                 stop stop or the service offices will                                 come on these privileges can be managed                                 in user manager user management is also                                 a part of project it is also using tomar                                 in the background                                 short steps there's different policies                                 for this user and you can manage this we                                 can give user authentication for dinner                                 oops                                 with

                     from so strangely                                 you see a classmate update itself and                                 when you change something to click you
