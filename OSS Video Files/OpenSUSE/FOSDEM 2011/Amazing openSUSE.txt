Title: Amazing openSUSE
Publication date: 2011-02-07
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	openSUSE has developed both great infrastructure technology and a powerful enduser product; where is it going now?  Over 5 years ago Novell decided to turn their new asset, SuSE Linux into a community distribution. It was a long and laborious process but since almost 2 years now the development processes have been opened up to the community. We now speak of openSUSE, a community which is now searching for it's direction. The project has state-of-the-art infrastructure at its disposal and develops a modern, stable and powerful linux distribution. Meanwhile, communication and marketing are it's weak points - innovative technologies like the openSUSE Build Service and SUSE Studio do not get the exposure they deserve. In this talk an overview is given of openSUSE's history, the developments in the community and the latest openSUSE technology is presented.

holidays behind                                this door I'm going to start with a                                little bit of history but a super                                comfortable then i'll continue about                                where audiences and the darkness is                                between now and i'll move on to some                                conscious technology and try to get a                                little a little into the future so                                opensuse is it the young is it all                                that's actually the question I first                                like to focus on so I'm souza the TM of                                 MBAs the company started in                                nineteen ninety four weeks before it has                                performed them in a trance one of the                                oldest linux exclusives it started                                initially as a attempt to translate                                slackware to german and I'll basically                                make available to Germany so initially                                souza gmbh was a distributor of children                                personal structure but after a while the                                start of dudes accolades beach house and                                adopted our bearing from rat edwin's you                                know sprung up some of                                tonight for our belief of                                                                                                                    felon for Susan and novell decided to                                create opensuse as a community                                discipline so for Colonel fel the                                consumer version of Susan Leonard's                                wasn't really interesting no foul have                                Matt one of the folks on corporate site                                and selling in boxes with support was                                simply not something of ours really                                interesting that's why the inside of the                                most basic and making the consumer                                version of sims                                                      community around it under the next                                welcome Susan so yeah they started it                                five years ago and you know when the                                goals as i said in omega-                                               make sure that you know Susan aqua the                                use of one it because it will influence                                it                                and their business model is basically                                you know make money on the commercial                                enterprise course in private it's pretty                                simple so the more successful opensuse                                is as a product determine initials for                                the enterprise closing cost anything to                                get in contact with the products and be                                you know they're familiar with it so                                they can much easier to use the                                enterprise products and you know the                                other pressures arming and amplification                                certification professional support all                                that stuff and it costs money so no                                filming someone in bed so focus souza is                                                                                                      in the name that's true but even as                                immunity it's much younger even than                                that it's like one and a half years old                                it only says one hour of years can you                                really contribute to all about them                                suspects effectually the development                                three of em susan has only been opened                                up very short time about one half two                                years so as a community has one and the                                baggage feels like an hour                                            of history on the other hand it's only                                been really enough source community for                                one hour here so it's still looking for                                its place in the world right and                                well that makes it actually very                                interested in reruns try this opensuse                                is something that still hasn't really                                defines what it wants where it wants to                                go I would want to get there and it                                means that there are still a lot of room                                also to influence these choices which is                                you know what is still also going on                                with other people and others are no                                trying things it's very easy to do that                                because there's no no red tape no rules                                no limits novell is actually very laid                                back in a council influence enough azusa                                it's only really wants to do it though                                and actually closer to the employees as                                 far as I can tell it goes if they want                                 to do it they used to be do it right                                 it's it's very little rules no technical                                 for that kind of stuff it's just put                                 them up to every idea work on it and                                 they follow people wanted your grades                                 and you know you can use that only you                                 can do all that can do Susie                                 infrastructure so this makes it a very                                 dynamic a very fun place to be around                                 which also need to interface will do                                 quite a few cool things now we'll come                                 to that later so it's a real free                                 software project now well then you know                                 to get that across it's very much both                                 on our project we're basically anyone                                 can make a difference in                                 really depends on the people who are                                 active and another aspect I want to                                 focus on this collaboration so as i                                 outsource community officers really has                                 a strong focus on collaboration it's                                 very new so it's still very open it also                                 means you know we look outside a lot and                                 we look at not fedora so we look at what                                 the three times they will have a bunt                                 and all the other Linux a solutions so                                 for example our conference at the end of                                 last year october at a startled                                 collaboration across borders and the                                 idea behind it was to try and get people                                 there also from other linux exclusives                                 so we had people from Red Hat we work                                 with them to use systemd which hospital                                                                                                     that's the Boonta system in the next                                 version of opensuse did it work out by                                 the way so completely stable yet but we                                 have experimental included                                 in future the same goes for dragons at                                 don't really know your status of that                                 but its replacement for mk in its RV so                                 basically increasing innocent buddha                                 image then again is something was                                 developed for fedora right Anthony were                                 done worked at them to interpret that                                 fuzhou via it's also basically being                                 developed by susan developer and the Red                                 Hat developer so this is the kind of                                 stuff then you know we want to                                 collaborate because it says everybody                                 work and time all right and you got a                                 better product so you want to move free                                 software for art and not just you know                                 our Creator on a little world if you                                 know barriers to entry and all that                                 stuff as open as possible so when you                                 come to the products again opensuse very                                 open we try to provide all the magic                                 desktop so you have to know anywhere                                 alex de miguel next league murder well                                 actually where r                                                         do a one another leech we already                                 released all their stuff for all mezuzah                                 so

was closely I think                                 personally that's really important so to                                 summarize it all other Susan is a young                                 and very friendly very open in a way                                 there is a lot of cool stuff it's                                 collaborative in work for everyone but                                 of course up Sue's another I we do                                 really cool stuff and that's something                                 I'd like to focus on now we have really                                 unique technology so let me start with                                 one of those the others the open Souza                                 will take the matter in any open to the                                 service if you're a developer then your                                 focuses on developing software obviously                                 right you write codes and then you want                                 to get it color to the hands of your                                 users of course then you put a tarball                                 someone on the websites and that is                                 certainly one way is getting softer out                                 and if you're a hater your exam                                 developer so the big issue because                                 species will come and their packages                                 will packets your software for all these                                 species but if you just developed a                                 completely new application without any                                 you know Bailey name and it then that's                                 not going to happen you essentially have                                 to make sure myself that you can't                                 expect it for all these well existence                                 right and they may even maybe windows or                                 mac OS x if you want to support us but                                 if you run say slackware then it's kind                                 of difficult to build practice for                                 fedora                                                               using that sale and of course couple of                                 suits version maybe mutton support                                 mandriva debian ladies two more free                                 versions that means well either                                 installing like                                                        because it is exactly what obvious                                 basically once do so oh yes is and I'm                                 going to demo very quickly after this                                 but very short it is a website where you                                 can go to and basically tell lbs look                                 here's my kids response critical story                                 or else my super simple story or ears                                 packet build it try to give it the spec                                 trials we actually working on auto                                 generate in that so currently you have                                 to have still quite some knowledge from                                 packaging but we try to make sure the                                 future even if you know barely anything                                 about packaging of rpms and apps you can                                 still use of yes and you say now to fill                                 this and I want to have it for the lens                                 free person of the door at the data                                 screen were super cool too i'm on debian                                 about sentosa want                                 Avant opensuse I want to sleep I believe                                 somebody's going to work on arts linux                                 or imperfect just pick it and i'll be at                                 wilson for your automated I mean you can                                 do this from a windows work session ID                                 if you're at work and you're not allowed                                 to use lynners finally don't need to                                 come online don't need anything really                                 easy out and I'll go and show you a                                 little demo of this oh that's my buddy                                 mouse                                 okay so this is simply series of                                 screenshots we're going to go through                                 them pretty quickly because frankly I                                 really used obvious very much and a                                 couple of things that are damaging the                                 screenshot I don't understand it all so                                 too fast so you go in you go to your                                 whole project on the top and here you                                 see your packages and say well you know                                 create a new packet soup I'm going                                 through the whole process of building                                 and package your arms quickly so get a                                 name can I give the description etc etc                                 etc done ok source files you can either                                 pick a source service which you can                                 point to again towards a personal story                                 or you simply upload the packets to the                                 file uploads there's part now what you                                 need next goes in front to build a                                 package arrived your needs respect file                                 for rpm packages and government files                                 for dead languages now as I said you can                                 use this data from the brown sugar                                 dinner have you really like it you can                                 also do this on qualified so that come                                 up when clients and one personal Main                                 Street Sasha as use come on fly for part                                 of the work                                 creating spectra horrific copied it from                                 somewhere creates a changing spiral bill                                 said completely from form online again I                                 usually prefer GUI so I don't through                                 this quickly but once you've done                                 rightly defines the darkness from the                                 command line and the darkness where you                                 were right we outside and you see a                                 couple of them are scheduled a couple of                                 them are currently building and                                 sentences then resolve all as                                 rather than struggling and strife so                                 what the problem there is that this                                 packets require see Meg and see maksim                                 gelman sense                                                            that you know it gets seen right by                                 including the Tang of project or you                                 simply what kita them just be the wrong                                 one okay so you go to the ripple storage                                 site and if you just click there you can                                 disable building for sandals on your                                 project again pretty easy and here you                                 see the exact same thing I said lots of                                 being settled residential building so                                 it's really useful online as you like                                 use the web browser if that works for                                 you                                 so here is building a couple of the                                 massive seen it and those that are                                 succeeded they create a repository I                                 don't think it's shown here so what                                 Sasha here in stingers do is to proceed                                 to submit the package for inclusion in                                 opposition which you can also do from                                 Lebanon if I so obvious doesn't just                                 allow you to build practice it allows                                 you to go through the whole process of                                 building the package without submitting                                 it from closing now from Susan it                                 supports groups or teams work together                                 both magazines men access rights                                 permissions and all that stuff basically                                 without years you condemn the whole                                 that's boosting a surprise that's what                                 we're doing with opensuse and not just                                 as obvious is currently being used by                                 media the project from linux foundation                                 former my mouth and Mowgli and for                                 example fears plc uses obvious in house                                 to build feel see packages because all                                 we had just completed free software so                                 this is a darling GPL apparently                                 you can download source code or                                 downloads and live image and run it in                                 virtual machine and inability reparative                                 so we're actually working on window                                 support for this as well so you can then                                 windows practices i have no they were                                 packaged for what they have but i guess                                 we'll figure that one out so that's a                                 yes i'm going to try to go back to my                                 presentation                                 that starts a meal that's                                 so in the end like packages right that's                                 what comes out of obvious so                                 okay so as I said you know it's much                                 more even than just for building                                 practices a whole collaborative platform                                 to build an SS bushes on and actually I                                 believe people from regalia are also                                 interested in using this for them you                                 know fork of monthly huh so maybe                                 they'll use it maybe there is an                                 interest in helping us developing it                                 just like linux foundation they have a                                 couple of people working on this                                 software as well so if you want to build                                 packages and not just frozen suitable                                 for fedora open to any other you know                                 this lucido new builds the local sues                                 the door check it out come play with it                                 sir if you're not really convinced that                                 opensuse has a lot of cool stuff you                                 know I'll show one thing now I'm going                                 to kick it up a notch and I'm going to                                 show you some studio which is really                                 really cool and again I'm going to do it                                 with a little green shield series                                 of this                                 so suz's to do so what is the idea                                 behind such a studio so still there was                                 a tool to build appliances and appliance                                 is basically a bit operating system and                                 the clients can either have in our one                                 major application so from some you build                                 an appliance basically an operating                                 system around one application like fire                                 falls film operating system entirely for                                 firefox right put it on that USB stick                                 or making it virtually misfire and up in                                 your virtual machine and you have the                                 web browser that's completely safe                                 because anytime you're ready because                                 it's also machine don't save anything                                 and you have an ultra-safe web browser                                 me doesn't get any safer than lugging                                 your web browser and fluency with an                                 appliance you can build that and this is                                 studio you can build an entirely from a                                 web browser and again as you might have                                 expected it's really really easy so I go                                 then I'm a domme right you say create a                                 new appliance you pick the base so you                                 can start with you know very minimalist                                 approach I'm thankful Kelly of non                                 festal once you pick this it grants your                                 clients you have a beautiful name and                                 you start running software so basically                                 here you can take any soft everyone so                                 the software here by default there's                                 everything that's included a notice of                                 the levant of free you know by default                                 but it connects to OBS which means we                                 have about                                                        packages available OBS which have been                                 built by about                                                          be as it used by a lot of being so                                 chances are pretty slim that your                                 package isn't somewhere available on OBS                                 and if it isn't then you know build it                                 yourself you've seen it it's pretty easy                                 so once you pick all software everyone                                 let's say something goes wrong you can                                 you know resolve conflicts between                                 packages directly from the web interface                                 it's fully complete once you're done you                                 configure a tractable what the network                                 firewall user groups passwords you                                 customize the look of Phil you can                                 upload your own images you set up                                 databases you can change all the                                 settings when you create first and see                                 images I was this year's it create                                 virtual Syngenta's among other things                                 you can upload your own custom scripts                                 but you can also upload your own                                 classroom files so you can upload the                                 tarball which is an extracted in certain                                 directory so basically anything you need                                 to build your own operating system for                                 example if your system administrator and                                 you want to have like a Swiss Army knife                                 on your USB stick always                                 with you this is how you build because                                 you can do within                                                   grass or anywhere in the world once                                 you've done you pick how do you want the                                 outputs are you say like you know I                                 won't live CD or it was big image you                                 want the hardest image you can have                                 selling VMware obvious amazon's ec                                      also supported actually we're working on                                                                                                         once this has been built you can click                                 claim fire it up on amazon and you don't                                 even need to download it and then upload                                 it to amazon yourself so build it and                                 you know if you think all of this is it                                 cool enough you can test drive it yes                                 sir from the web browser you simply we                                 booked up the image in a fee and all the                                 suits of servers and you know you can                                 just log in and see somewhere in between                                 it switched from you know too baby                                 another that happened someone                                 controlling screen shopping now you can                                 also use as its age by the way to London                                 to your you know just created appliance                                 and what's also really nice is if you                                 create any funds or make any changes                                 what if I configuration for example I                                 don't get to sale it into the appliance                                 anything you configure here                                 there are going to be final image with                                 you you know download when you're done                                 that's Cecilia pretty cool i would say                                 so sooner studio builds upon home Susan                                 technology like Kiwi a couple of other                                 things Souza studio itself is not                                 entirely free software but the                                 underlying technology is so for example                                 with the technology you could connect                                 the live CD image technology of the life                                 you know image signal in general                                 connected                                                                across story if you want to create                                 nightly builds of Firefox you can all                                 set it up from a web browser in Adana a                                 couple of hours time and with one click                                 new updates in a run a cron job in                                 computer without identity also spilled                                 so it's okay to update from get bill to                                 packets and rebuild the illness it's                                 incredibly easy in anyone could do it so                                 worried                                 that social studio                                 sure                                 that's what we have done that's kind of                                 technology Suzanne of course there's a                                 lot more where this came from but I                                 don't have all we can talk there just                                 now and i would guess some of you might                                 get hungry after a couple days anyway so                                 i'm going to talk about one of the                                 latest and hottest process and its                                 principal developer simply vector over                                 there is big smile on his face so this                                 project person and they are they are                                 prolific pretzel and i consider is                                 really icing on the game after you have                                 seen in our early ancestors to do the                                 array behind this is that as a developer                                 it's nice to use i'll be has to build in                                 packages right this you want to pack                                 little done with all that stuff as                                 possible if you want to focus on writing                                 software but even when you have packages                                 you still have some great website in our                                 people can download it and you have to                                 start from out get on facebook and                                 twitter an identical us to do all that                                 all social media stuff that feel                                 completely up to be uninteresting and                                 after all that is done you have all                                 these users that are either come to send                                 you emails or ask questions importance                                 and give you feedback by a million                                 different ways and                                 you need to process all that now that                                 whole process basically from you from                                 kernels to finally having some feedback                                 and create new with other girls it's                                 something that project bresson basically                                 aims to simplify and you know make it                                 really really pretty easy and wrexham                                 ties together the bill surface open                                 collaboration sources which is an ABI

                               comments on staff and the technology                                 from app stores and again LCS to collect                                 the feedback so the whole process from                                 basically done your application in an ID                                 deal once you've done you currently need                                 to leave

              source code to the axis tilts                                 once it receives the repositories and                                 packaging beckandbill serves it will                                 submit them to absorb either website or                                 domingo app store or now will definitely                                 live magically we look it's plug in that

all                                 possible once that is done it will                                 gather the feedback from the users from                                 the App Store's back to you as                                 developers and say like okay so the                                 bigger used to think that this                                 application has ready for one star at                                 the farm mu doing something wrong in our                                 touch screens because people another                                 susan they really like it and they give                                 it                                                                 that's great so now that kind of should                                 give you a hint as to where the problem                                 lies and well my presentation said that                                 this is sitting in December but actually                                 it was released a couple of days ago                                 little delay there and this is well                                 already you can download the browser

                            for example retsu plugins basically                                 built on a very simple library so you                                 can try to plug in                                    VI or emacs or Teddy developed or                                 whatever you use Eclipse maybe animation                                 tributed back to the breath the team                                 because they want those plugins right                                 and then you know it works you just                                 click button ask a couple questions and                                 your practice gas bills and gets                                 distributed currently I believe Frank                                 you currently only use the open desktop                                 tool or websites or publishing yes                                 oh well oh yes of course then the                                 internet and power equal to the Holy One                                 perhaps the future okay so therefore                                 coming but currently you use only the                                 websites or problems that are eTI's to                                 the other extant that will do                                 ok cool so now you get on Kady                                 absolutely no maps of the cells websites                                 right yeah so that's something you might                                 wanna have look at if you're an                                 application developer mozilla well get                                 rid of all the boring stuff around you                                 know getting implication out so that's                                 not a project within a loser I'm going                                 to talk about one last projects than                                 forming an affiliate days that's project                                 tumbleweed it's something that was                                 started by greg kroah-hartman while ago                                 and the are David I can't go with this                                 aqua Sousa is a distribution that                                 releases every                                                           release schedule and every eight months                                 you have any enforcement officers but if                                 you want the latest KD or brown or                                 fedora a powerful story in between you                                 have to get that from oh yes and then if                                 you also want the latest Oval Office                                 together from wealthy as and within a                                 couple of months after release you have                                 like I don't know                                                       all these different of death packages                                 okay the role Millfield in solution so                                 it's it's going to be pretty stable but                                 it's still a lot of work and                                 be honest a lot of people like to have                                 the latest software all the time                                 including me on the line technology so                                 ass couple of disabilities like for                                 example get into an arts linux they                                 actually don't really do clicks releases                                 well they sometimes we release something                                 but that's just the newer version of                                 their installer basically nothing else                                 what they do is assume as for example                                 you know to what                                                       may catch it and put it in the closet or                                 ease the down low scores put back off                                 our backs releases in there at only the                                 final release and the first go through a                                 little testing phase so that means that                                 if your user one of those disabilities                                 are always up to date it will never have                                 to reinstall or get the new floors in an                                 upgrade it just always works they're                                 always on the edge now you could do that                                 with fedora and with my                                                 because they have a development tree                                 what Suzette's both factory the door as                                 overall height and mandriva has cougar                                 believe you're on hooker or robots or                                 factory you get the latest software yet                                 I have really two candidates they have                                 all fast as bad as I mean it's well uh                                 turley completely unstable hopeless well                                 it's all entirely fun I mean you have to                                 be willing to fix things all the time                                 and put up it you know pretty big issues                                 sometimes so that's not really a                                 solution if you run one of those                                 disciplines if you want to let software                                 well that's what tumbleweed comes it                                 goes double the weight is going to be an                                 hour be a triple story                                 with her own religion                                 that means if your name isn't repository                                 you have always been soft steady                                 software so to come don't get a fretful                                 time and when there's a new opensuse                                 release out yeah nice you know you                                 already have everything so my dollar and                                 this so this project has already been                                 stunned and there is a tumbleweed well                                 every level                                                          double wit and they won't have to                                 upgrade will have to look for when it                                 comes out in                                                          from                                                                   full swing and you know in entomology                                 you'll never have to upgrade or install                                 offices again me so that yes it's so                                 horrible when you go through an upright                                 but yet this way it's even nicer right                                 so I hope that by now as punishment that                                 convinced that with all the school stuff                                 that up Sue's have to do that's quite a
