Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	The complexity of configuring client authentication with Kerberos or LDAP is well known. With sssd the whole process has been simplified. We are going to take a look at the framework and supported identity and authentication provides. Some examples will show the capability of sssd.

	                              selling wings                               so let's excel all of you against                               everyone who sees and Phoenix has                               completed authentication on the system                               there are different ways and access the                               configuration for setting up                               authentication the easiest way is heart                               beating and configuration form of                               accounts of connection and directory but                                we will have at least eh Graham working                                to configure kelvins and all that stuff                                the disadvantage of that kind of classic                                configurations that there are one many                                config files to observe to keep xx and                                AB sedated you know what you can figure                                where to get it flows and clean sound so                                the next disadvantage we have a similar                                situation is that which we got to                                catching something margin of MCD with                                the make service cashing Eamonn which is                                responsible for catching the account                                information from we note directly                                accounts locally                                a lot of problems with sensi need at                                least when it's covered at least when it                                comes to a large number of objects and                                the terms of directive we are talking                                about                                                                   in our directory set up and so after a                                while and it's decently crashed and we                                have to be solid and what was more the                                next disadvantages that you can't lock                                in low locally if you are offline so you                                have to be connected to a directory                                service to connect to the directory                                service that's what I mean with offline                                authentication possible so it was real                                time for some new wallpapers I was glad                                he came up recently which was invented                                by Red Hat and there's a team of                                developers that maybe Steven Gallagher                                who really does a great job introducing                                a success fee and SSST is meant to be                                placement of all the configuration                                options in the county have in your                                classic on it simplifies the whole                                configuration to one file which is e TC                                as of these are common and if you take a                                look the simple asses of eat comp looks                                like that the global configuration                                section where you find domains and we                                fair to means to the main settings and                                here's just a simple domain server where                                you really got local educational the                                drivers of this kind of setups that                                you can combine these domains you can                                add additional you can also configure                                the configuration of the in addition                                with configuration and travels                                configuration yeah before you would like                                to have an NSC replacement the caching                                or algorithm office intensity is very                                good the nav experience any questions on                                that                                and something like augmentation so now                                your possible to configure to                                directivity top of the network take it                                home and still be able to log on your                                machine using your preferred a directory                                credentials                                yeah what do you got for identity                                providers we can configure this major                                identity providers for varying identity                                information we're all set up we've                                configured other for using an Active                                Directory out of and even open up set up                                it is possible to configure Iike as well                                as what is decided IPM is optional and                                we something that                                we kept celibate for authentication from                                yours                                we got votes we got passwords on the                                elbow and we will use travels for                                authentication so that it's education                                but you can as well use ether for that                                the local thumb configuration box                                so as essences these was invented by                                racket it's mainly Luud in the weather                                distributions at the moment we're very                                well or well six which is since a while                                and even while                                                     included but in the quiet lower at the                                moment burn                                                             still has some limitations so ideally                                well setup you have to know that you got                                no no not working yet we are planning to                                what it is planning to push the light is                                going to the upcoming release of                                Resident apostle                                 which for me five word and sixth of one                                 these are the limitations of this one of                                 the limitations we have another                                 limitation which we count the F and the                                 latest setups which is one of our top                                 one reporting doesn't always work but                                 this is long so my chances for you to                                 give you an overview what doesn't this                                 deals and you so twice if you are                                 already using a web-based system which                                 means fellow up or with it just give it                                 so I take a look at it it's fine easy to                                 configure and very good advantages in                                 this patch of grass and if you have for                                 example building packages for other                                 destinations it would be great if                                 someone would pick up the tasks and                                 finish as the for example for DVM                                 channel                                                                 welcome                                 so if you can out there                                 perfectly afterwards you can fathom news                                 of the fedoras                                 we can talk about packaging decisions                                 also if you're interested in advanced                                 setup or want to take a look how as a                                 teacher Kong might look if you care for                                 any other one in something like that                                 you can join me up talk to me down so                                 here's example exam the continuation to                                 to let you know how okay that's all for                                 that's our overview I want to thank you                                 for now and if you have any further                                 questions concern misty yes okay you're                                 very fast if you have to say something                                 more                                 drive the question yeah so what can you                                 talk a bit about some of the steps that                                 we that a person should take if they                                 want to think about migrating their                                 configurations you know you talked about                                 the whole thing in the new thing but                                 yeah that's the order to go in before to                                 do it successfully I would suggest to                                 take a look at the federal housing                                 project or SSD which contains some                                 useful information and also contains a                                 ticketed by tracking system so if you                                 figure out any box or two problems you                                 can just ask you can also join up in a                                 list which is quite responsive I mean                                 talking directly to the developer                                 baggage enjoy is co-owner mail mailing                                 list and for a basic set of slst it                                 ships very good documentation                                 documentation is included in the record                                 deployment colleagues which you will                                 find on an enterprise linux as well as                                 Santos                                 as was the documentation and it got                                 seven pages it comes one main page for                                 the main configuration and the minimums                                 for careful set up incidence the                                 underscore character                                 I've been patient as the another                                 plantation with why too few examples                                 explain how to stop it's really easy                                 getting compounds with their classic                                 setup it's quite easy because you got                                 all in one place you got an overview of                                 another setting you can review of your                                 camera settings I played along with it                                 within several kind of setups that the                                 moment on I'm using I'm planning to use                                 up to this cover week before KCC's using                                 DNS security errors and was quite easy                                 to copy compared with us except which is                                 not that hard                                 at Burger facility before and I wasn't                                 of the nutritional extra chemist even as                                 well no at the moment these impulses and                                 ability to dimension we rely on                                 libraries of health as well as couples                                 were station client authorities so they                                 have to be present it's just a                                 configuration for anywhere that's what                                 we place the second language which is                                 even of the intent of the project                                 yeah and we are planning to put em for                                 example we find support and relevant is                                 just also do the service of immunization                                 of rivers or was that a mistake                                 nutrition if it replaces for service                                 teams doesn't do that or just for the                                 new client side no it's just a client                                 okay so that was their investment thank                                 you                                 you have any insight into how the                                 journals of the data storage works as                                 its stories state so that                                 there's a database I'm not sure I                                 painted some                                 database but my here with this database                                 file is on file system where the cattle                                 stores and the given B card information                                 is stored and the separate database but                                 you can easily adjust the it advisable                                 which are indication on the next meeting                                 so there's an outing now awaiting                                 depends on at the moment we have the                                 problem that we got quite a large number                                 of options so we are not able to                                 innovate them all so I at the moment of                                 this they should be number because it                                 doesn't work but that something is all                                 about that page number ways possible                                 so innovation will happen few steps                                 first                                                                    and so on if you don't use another                                 waiting                                 it's caches on query so you can actually                                 capture the because of the holiday and                                 what we cups quite a lot of focus was                                 nested loops so if you got a group set                                 up where in                                 and that's what we have in our                                 implementation we had a long one and                                 still have but we are working on it and                                 hopefully in one of the next modern man                                 you insist we gotta top okay all right                                 during a message in to handle the number                                 offered every as you can                                 projections of the good no it doesn't                                 very memo retributive slot the standard                                 of the head of definition so that was                                 something I was thinking of this way                                 because it would be quite easier to use                                 that but the reason that's to talk to                                 steal involvement for the first the                                 reason for it is not implementing the                                 third way it's just wearing or groups                                 and sergey's and maybe we can think                                 about some distinguished ones so if the                                 service we take some Active Directory                                 valance member of attributes                                 it could decline for then use the member                                 of and should use different but member                                 of attributes cup this is what should                                 that they virtually does not contain the                                 massive boobs so you still have to                                 cranny member abuse and still have to                                 grab that fools if there are any muscle                                 actually yeah but it's not                                 three administrations yeah                                 you got any cover Christians or other                                 negatives here for a Medusa beautiful                                 Fedora                                 I apparently nor is there an implicit to                                 here like I'm also a Devi                                 yes and we have to package it for the in                                 will think like one-time passwords                                 well they say you VT be able to go                                 through sssp as well                                 maybe it's planned for future indigenous                                 weird basics whatnot we care we are glad                                 that we gather one in setup so and it                                 works well for the basic since I guess                                 it when we send the jobs of the next few                                 months and years okay                                 any questions                                 when your edit project forwards whether                                 this has hired the developers of this                                 page the developers of the project but                                 it is some federal offices project so                                 it's completely office or since most                                 whether projects are and it's meant to                                 be as a general project it doesn't make                                 sense the only one is usually isn't it                                 just to make sure it's just it's really                                 an advantage you won't do anything using                                 as a system it's just maybe feel better                                 because it's easy to configure so I some                                 of the solutions will pick that up soon                                 and best to help out if there are any                                 questions from some packages or                                 packaging other students but another big                                 deal accredited for scientists we need                                 someone who says to do that and for all                                 who Susan Jacobs we could just use the                                 audience and                                 and fallen from the wetted parts part of                                 you                                 regards configuration tool and off                                 config which is available fiddlehead                                 system community and which heavens basic                                 configuration tasks so you can even use                                 a conflict to configure simple                                 SSST SSST as a part lacking so because                                 just like and that's all and I guess any                                 other we should pretend that on their                                 way for example water does not have that                                 kind of computer configuration tool                                 accounts with the records pre-configured                                 power setups which would suffer most                                 situations I guess it came from thinking                                 it's wrong saluton invention and                                 absolutely answers that mean and what                                 what we also can do is any excess                                 restrictions that is something that                                 don't have mentioned in hospital                                 so if you counted working with an excess                                 come for something like that this could                                 also be in place please as a system set                                 up so you can allow specific moves to                                 lock it in on the specific service and                                 within the domain and to speak all other                                 domains for it is that modulus Center                                 makes it really easy to handle that kind                                 of configuration files with conflict                                 management system like for example Papa                                 dices                                 maybe we can also want the puppies                                 extension versus it should be the top                                 and then you can just say this load is                                 this domain setup and it will                                 automatically okay                                 I'm personally to either on or                                 consulting maybe I have to talk about                                 the true some of the developers if I'm                                 fighting afterwards I'm going to talk to                                 him if you can make the presentations I                                 think I could even package it focuses so                                 I service so it is already in shop into                                 that
