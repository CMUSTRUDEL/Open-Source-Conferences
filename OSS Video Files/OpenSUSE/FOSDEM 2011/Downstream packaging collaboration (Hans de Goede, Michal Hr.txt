Title: Downstream packaging collaboration (Hans de Goede, Michal Hr
Publication date: 2011-02-07
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	patch sharing or start a new upstream?Most distributions contain packages where upstream is completely dead or very close to it, yet there still is a significant user group for the packages in question, be it directly or through other packages depending on them. But even when upstream is alive, packages often needs some additional patching.All distributions seem to end up carrying some custom distro grown patchset, with some patches being shared and other patches being unique per distro. Clearly not an ideal situation and one which most distributions try to avoid by feeding all necessary changes upstream and aiming for having packages which use the upstream provided code as is.Clearly the usual model of sharing code fixes / integration work done at the distribution level between distributions by pushing it upstream does not work for projects where there is no upstream. And even with upstream around, distributions sometimes needs to fix bugs in versions that upstream no longer care about or fix bugs that are not important/considered feature upstream and it may take a long time to get them fixed there. In the end we can't avoid all patching. But we can try to avoid duplicating the work by better sharing the results.The plan for this sessions is to give a short presentation sketching the problem, show two possible approaches to help solving this problem together with few generally helpful ideas. After presenting these hopefully somewhat structured discussion with the audience about this topic is planned.

knee                               enterprise commercial distributions that                               everybody pretends to know and love and                               or hate and in the process talk just a                               little bit about sort of the evolutions                               last year but first I'm curiosity how                               many of you have you ever heard me Keva                                toxin before okay hopeful very very                                quickly just so you know who I am and                                have a little bit of context at elf upon                                me my first contribution to what we now                                call free software in about nineteen                                seventy nine it was a piece of assembly                                language for a microprocessor which was                                obscure then it's now been completely                                forgotten but it led me down a sort of                                interesting path                                a really interesting career of doing                                things in open source world I had the                                privilege with a blast almost ten years                                we're serving as the chief technologist                                for open source and went to HP and what                                exactly that means it's probably just as                                much of the district music it means                                really that I've had the opportunity to                                help get things the way the company                                thinks about free software and more                                recently open source and that's really                                important because HTS become such an                                incredibly great company with what's in                                the world ride RT space and I'm pleased                                on the whole I think the company hates                                reasonably well around free software                                open source projects and I think we've                                actually managed over the years to have                                you very positive influence on a bunch                                of different project I'm of course you                                know showing their colors today not only                                be

sort of                                Clinton happens I did them far a couple                                slides from the market guys I hope you                                won't be too offended by that but I                                don't think everybody understands                                because our marketing guys aren't always                                it's good about getting messages they                                could it should be you know for more                                than a decade HP has been the largest                                seller in world black servers and                                related kit we have not always been the                                folks talking the most about it one                                excerpt even in fact making the biggest                                investments in free software clinics                                development but we have now consistently                                for the more than a decade been market                                leaders notes and part of the reason for                                that I believe is that we have taken                                wife is such a sort of a genuine and                                honest approach to trying to understand                                how it work within our community                                development processes and ended up as a                                consequence enabling all sorts of things                                in mind                                awesome it felt able to do of course                                another marketing slide just because                                though we are doing things that are sort

it's a                                little Christmas a lot of things we do                                it's led great benchmark results it's                                led to you know strong commitment from                                various companies and ability for lots                                of customers who want to run really big                                commercial applications on top of                                wonders                                                                in the fall of                                                        little unexpected I think we have for                                years not just because of my position                                involvement because it but because many                                other people HP also discovered has been                                working with WNN with other non                                commercial species we found ourselves a                                situation where customers asked for it                                we looked around at ourselves drawers                                 that really could provide the same kind                                 of commercial support offerings for the                                 Debian distribution that we have been                                 providing for red hacking for novell                                 says it and to a lesser extent some                                 other geographically specific                                 distributions prior to that we've done                                 some press releases with the Internet's                                 folks for example but that was all very                                 geographically concerning now here it is                                 what it is for almost four and a half                                 years later the best of my knowledge was                                 still the only producer of the iron                                 servers that provides official support                                 offerings for a distribution it isn't a                                 major commercial distribution and                                 this to me is something that I'm still                                 very proud but it's extended losses                                 today there's a whole sort of range of                                 distributions that HP provides some                                 degree of official support enter network                                 and internally these get thought about                                 is is very much in distinguish between                                 commercial distributions and community                                 distributions you can get picky about                                 what that battered really needs but                                 inside the company it's a useful way to                                 think about you doing and what it really                                 has to do with is a combination of what                                 sort of non-hp badge human resources and                                 money and other things are available to                                 help push results of the work forward                                 combined with how do people think about                                 it and what are they actually want them                                 company mike HP so we talked about                                 commercial distribution these are                                 partnerships this is where there is some                                 company behind lenox distribution that                                 actually can engage in sort of all of                                 them normal business dealings and                                 business relationship mechanics would                                 have taken you joint marketing things we                                 can work on all sorts of things that                                 make sense to people to reduce the barn                                 commercial proprietary operating systems                                 at the other end of the spectrum you                                 have a lot of customers you tell us we                                 just wanna buy your partner                                 we want to know before we buy your                                 hardware that is really going to work                                 with our distribution to us and that                                 ends up being kind of the difficult                                 thing to do because if you're going to                                 spend the time and energy to go out and                                 test a particular distribution on final                                 burglar that requires an investment of                                 time and empower and other resources and                                 if there's no direct mechanism for                                 generating revenue from that activity if                                 you don't get to sell some support                                 contracts or something at the end of the                                 day how do you justify this how do you                                 quantify what their turn on that                                 investment you can't just say we'll sell                                 a few more boxes because everybody who                                 makes what they finna car and customers                                 seem to believe or some of the world's                                 best industry standard servers believe                                 they're gonna sell the servers and so                                 internally the process of figuring out                                 how to justify doing extra work that's                                 required to be able to validate the                                 community distributions do in fact work                                 on the hardware provide even some                                 lightweight support the building pens                                 like it's a client support packs for                                 distributions that weren't already part                                 the official support road it's been a                                 really interesting challenge I'm just                                 really tickled that over time we figured                                 out how to do that and permit because we                                 ended up establishing what I think                                 there's a very strong relationships with                                 key contributors and different                                 distributions so what comes out of this                                 other than just the notion that we put a                                 logo up on our website sort of implied                                 if you run that distribution will still                                 love you it's an HP actually produces                                 these things called Alliance important                                 parks what they used to be that these                                 were important because they contain                                 device drivers for a murderer they                                 mostly don't contain device drivers                                 anymore because one of the things that                                 be very successfully done in the last                                 years is upstream all of the interesting                                 drivers that are part of making the cool                                 extra value-added hardware on HP                                 proliant servers work and so today is                                 the norm that people running                                 Lacson any distribution on an HP                                 proliant server and do something fun to                                 do that did it needs to be true yeah why                                 did you apply the                                 luxuries I'm sorry reason because of                                 library versions                                 SEL                                 yeah no direction I've freely admitted                                 their bugs in the stuff that's been                                 shown and those guys keep working on it                                 and over time it gets better it's a HEPA                                 lot better now than it was a year and a                                 half ago for example where we're still                                 shipping                                                                                                                                distributions yeah well you know kind of                                 work most of the time it's been very                                 interesting because one of the things we                                 discovered is that there's quite a bit                                 build machinery that had been put in                                 place over time to build this out of the                                                                                                        and the folks had originally built a lot                                 of the machinery we're not around at                                 anyone and so a permanence in getting                                 people to be willing to commit enough                                 human resources to go unwind some of the                                 dependency chains figure out why it is                                 that we're doing things the sometimes                                 crazy ways they were doing before than                                 before and actually go rebuild some of                                 that infrastructure in a way that does                                 the right things for modern                                 distributions there are folks that are                                 still hard at work                                 get all those things right but I would                                 argue that every time there's a new SP                                 release they seem to be getting better                                 if they don't seem to be getting better                                 gee it's a bug teleson trying to figure                                 out yeah and if you're not getting good                                 response from the moment sport channels                                 for those things my email address is                                 pretty widely published its anyway i do                                 want to point out that there are a                                 couple of more or less official channels                                 for providing feedback about what's in                                 these pits today they mostly have things                                 like management agents and user space                                 demons that will do things like monitor                                 the health of the server / using the                                 drivers that are the colonel to                                 interpret some of the information coming                                 from the baseboard management processors                                 and so forth i would love in a perfect                                 world of all of that stuff could be a                                 hundred percent open source but the                                 reality is some of these things are                                 things that continue to be points of                                 differentiation for the company so these                                 PS PS have optional and user space                                 demons that you can run if you want to                                 be able to take advantage some of the                                 capabilities that are hardware today the                                 best of my knowledge none of those                                 require taking your which is a huge                                 change from a couple years ago and then                                 I do want to point out that feedback                                 that's come in through either H                                 presiding bishop center and forums and                                 discussions of groups that exist there                                 or you know for the last year                                 the work site that we're good to go to                                 talk a little bit more about a minute                                 those have actually influence of                                 thinking about how to prioritize some of                                 its work and how these things have                                 gotten deliver so don't think that we                                 don't listen because we will really do                                 and when I talk to the guys in Houston                                 and pull columns to do a lot of this                                 work the thing is for quest they have it                                 be was please figure out how to get                                 people's more feedback because they                                 would just love to hear from you an                                 amazing even there so the community                                 Lennox that works like how many of you                                 know about this certain but you the                                 recipe should take a look the objective                                 in creating the site was to create a                                 place outside HP's on IT infrastructure                                 all of this process rules the love that                                 what people could collaborate in the                                 very authentic community kind of way on                                 to talk about what takes to make that X                                 work well on the vast bread products                                 that company produces in fact we be                                 completely happy to see people talk                                 about other systems and servers there as                                 well but I think the behavior that's                                 kind of come out of all of this is                                 everybody so he knows that h                                          this sponsoring it                                 talked about this isn't true at the next                                 time                                                                 site it's not competing CNN com I got                                 attention but if at that there are                                                                                                              and day out over time suggested me that                                 this really is seen some news and                                 recently we started being a little more                                 outreach wife again with the with the                                 knowledge that we're getting close to a                                 release of debian squeeze a couple of                                 weeks three weeks or something ago our                                 mobile person actually put out whether                                 cluster the customers who were                                 interested i will try the very least w                                 skis and solar stuff and let us know if                                 there are problems with it on alliances                                 it good news is that actually there are                                 in fact i got feedback directly from                                 friend last night who was sitting up on                                 this tonight years till daylight in the                                 US he was the process of islamist agency                                 do dl                                                                  the much cleaner handling for the                                 firmware objects                                 devices that we travel blogs and the                                 ease with which you can now create a USB                                 stick consult on things like that it was                                 all just working great and I'm hoping                                 that he will i goaded him a little bit                                 to go actually and post its recipe for                                 doing this is something that happens if                                 you do take a look at the site I think                                 that sometimes soon we'll probably be in                                 a survey that's posted there were you                                 should try to understand what other                                 people think the site is really useful                                 and if so what it is that's good about                                 it and if not you've got a new different                                 because this is certainly something                                 where we're trying to sort of have it be                                 a place where people can come and go to                                 the fabric and share best practices you                                 don't have to depend on sort of you know                                 the randomness of the results to come                                 back and removals are just something to                                 figure out you know how many important                                 particular hardware so it perfect                                 summarized on this quickly I think the                                 most important factor behind our ability                                 to do this is the really really simple                                 thing that we've been put down gears                                 which is if you want to support that ice                                 hardwood well the thing in half to do is                                 get all your drivers into the chrome                                 toiletry if you do that the rest of this                                 gets really really easy and in fact one                                 of my big concerns for the future is                                 that we are now a situation where as I                                 said you can                                 an untainted kernel and be completely                                 functional on the best majority that                                 consumer products but we are moving into                                 a period of time where product                                 development teams of staring at the                                 processing cores and the flash memory                                 ram to putting on our cards and staring                                 at the ever-increasing pour counts and                                 central processors and they're thinking                                 about the bus famines that are available                                 between the processors the i/o devices                                 and if scratching their heads wondering                                 why they're still downloading firmware                                 to land mobile processor out my reward                                 and I don't intend to suggest that                                 there's some huge switch that's about me                                 flipped here but I think over time                                 unless they somehow come to believe that                                 the value added associated with some of                                 these i/o devices that were a                                 controllers for example it once they                                 come to believe that that's all best                                 contributed into open source space we                                 could very easily find ourselves                                 backsliding into the situation we're                                 proprietor of content starts percolating                                 back up from below the firmware boundary                                 into things that they might have run in                                 the the main processors memory address                                 space if that happens to all of a sudden                                 you know I get very frustrated because                                 it will feel like a lot of progress is                                 being lost I don't know whether this                                 will really happen but as i watch sort                                 of the two leaves being screwed and                                 the forces that are at work out there I                                 worry that at some point we hannifin                                 situation just handling from binary                                 blobs isn't going to be sufficient will                                 be back to messing with I think we've                                 already been there you have a win modems                                 and winners printers in the past and                                 yeah yeah okay I think the reason is                                 mostly filled it was the best people                                 also realize it something's them and if                                 you especially if you can please open                                 them this is where Burt's Bees                                 involvement between if you have have if                                 you use your process for device driver                                 poop from doing more defensive work that                                 will also be required see to have caused                                 the process of them it's not a very good                                 thing yeah but what if you can pick up                                 the economics of this if you can take                                 some number of dollars of my advice and                                 we're all ready to the point where we                                 have servers even even inexpensive                                 servers that have                                                   execution bar you know and we're several                                 several doublings Shive where I think

back we almost a lot of time dwelling on                                 this I don't want everybody to walk away                                 saying oh video feeds the worlds of                                 backsliding it's going to get worse I                                 can't understand all the things that                                 keeps me awake admit is figuring out how                                 we avoid ending up in the situation I'll                                 take steps backwards                                 lower                                 I'm sorry I'm having a hard time very                                 sorry about that but it's not so can the                                 door to open to I was worried about the                                 openness from jail HP yeah once I played                                 right these are over for one day back                                 home boots r gk zy                                                       both our server and our notebook guys                                 are absolutely convinced that they have                                 substantial important intellectual                                 property parading their bonuses right i                                 am very careful easing the word they                                 here because it's not an opinion that i                                 completely agree with but continue to                                 believe that probability that they will                                 move to and we're open bio strategy or                                 some other booting strategy seems small                                 in fact the trend of IC is at the                                 industry across lots of architectures is                                 as likely to converge on the f                                        mechanisms as anything                                 and that is a trend that now has lots of                                 momentum behind it and it's unlikely to                                 change short and some major miracle so                                 for better for worse I think that's the                                 world we're heading towards I think it's                                 a better world than the world of sort of                                 legacy pc my license for a lot of                                 reasons but it's certainly not the                                 future I would have chosen I've got the                                 answers ok as you are talking about no                                 hoops since your old slides is about                                 servers yeah yeah that's all part of the                                 business I actually give this basically                                 they also do work on the lap of summer                                 yeah we actually should board notebooks                                 with Lennox pre-loaded on them than                                 anybody else in the world the problem is                                 that the vast majority does go into                                 geographies that human I don't visit                                 hurry up this is this no chains of                                 exchanging there's every chance of                                 changing but you have to think about                                 what it is that would actually cause it                                 to change but what positive changes a                                 radical change in the request /                                 commandery                                 I'll talk perform other venues over the                                 years about the very strange economics                                 when you start talking to very high                                 volume products and yeah and I've done                                 with the notes are but it's something                                 worth of pudding million quote unquote                                 he seems the internship last year and so                                 even though the number of machines they                                 shift preloaded with linux is huge by                                 comparison to any of our competitors                                 it's still just a drop in the bucket and                                 the problem is it spread across a bunch                                 of different models and budget product                                 month so trying to find any single place                                 where you would look and say oh that's                                 the product that you'd really ought to                                 put on the shelves at bestbuy Virginia                                 City and with it with a preload on it is                                 tough having said that that's all sorts                                 of interesting stuff coming up case you                                 hadn't noticed we acquired palm webos is                                 part of HP now                                 with webos me yeah I'll leave you to                                 ponder what that might mean for the                                 future with attendance I'll try to hit                                 that the fact that as confused about it                                 in CIP but yeah there's a lot of things                                 happened there are a lot of really                                 interesting things happening and I don't                                 found the Federals in any way shape or                                 form static in fact I think they're all                                 sorts of exciting things that we're                                 going over any love which the major news                                 items in the coming lots but we don't                                 ever talk about things aren't oyster                                 with not that a longer be other last                                 questions in the show thank you                                 you                                 you                                 okay from what our house talk about if                                 there is no up steam and nobody is                                 really actively developing it then it                                 it's obviously which idea to create                                 animosity if we found enough people to                                 do that but sometimes our love Phoenix                                 to backward fixes that we what we as a                                 distribution that doesn't do my new                                 versions and we sometimes up sting is                                 not dead and they are releasing new                                 versions but they just don't want to fix                                 some things that yeah we all agree on                                 yon somehow it must just a difference in                                 the way we think about harsh these                                 problems and I'm totally okay with that                                 i would just commented in my own work                                 for and thinking even when there's a                                 currently active upstream the very first                                 thing i want to do                                 every piece of source code again                                 anywhere here it's bringing into a good                                 distributed revision control system so                                 that i can stop dealing with all of that                                 old process baggage about trying to keep                                 track of which patches which and how                                 they're supposed to overlay particularly                                 in the hit universe with branches being                                 really cheap and connecting tonic you                                 know just life is so much simpler                                 somehow an American                                 the consensus of new solutions is at                                 this point of changing in Prague so the                                 concern resolution in please we all need                                 to have this change rafi solutions are                                 saying hey we need to have a spork yeah                                 our suite a kind of kind of for the keys                                 are is close that and then well we are a                                 kind of extreme yes                                 I think the fibers in kind of connecting                                 purchases will be collecting the whole                                 source called the whole Seuss book                                 version and having branches and stuff                                 like that instead of patches but yeah                                 one problem with that was an approach I                                 mean what was what you have to worry                                 until we do something like that is the                                 for example the gate level is then not                                 enough in on out of itself because it                                 can be very difficult to expect from a                                 rich history the information which                                 changes belong together and forwards                                 reasons they were made and maybe an                                 unmade later and stuff like that you                                 still need to have yet some kind of                                 description of of a change that you                                 still victory useful I think to think                                 income of pencils s my epic if it's so                                 emotional matter of course of writing                                 proper change money yes                                 yeah but you still have to we all agree                                 i think that we have to figure out how                                 to get this information out of the mines                                 effectively share that part just what's                                 the best if we used each to take all                                 these maybes you can obviously do where                                 the commit messages                                 well it might be just the time don't                                 know much about gift well I know of                                 course I know it but maybe I don't know                                 it to welcome but i think that with it                                 might be a little bit more difficult to                                 track down these patches in their change                                 in one branch to make it fast firstly                                 appear in all other branches and i think                                 it might be easy to forget about change                                 that happens to one branch if you are                                 not following it very first you need                                 having yup that's what I try to say I                                 mean to maintain a sense of changes to                                 an upstream is                                 it's not trivial you need to do it why                                 so you have to define procedures for                                 that but it's possible and I think when                                 you do it right you get more weighted                                 and petrels because a patch is always                                 just a two-way yeah you have to before I                                 another FAFSA but if you have correct                                 ranching and work good version control                                 system you have all the possibilities of                                 three or more way from traversing so it                                 can so that for example you can apply a                                 patch will be two different versions                                 even the small changes because the world                                 is references in the slit for you but                                 you I mean we don't often hear about one                                 branch for distribution I think we were                                 talking about one branch / fetch yes you                                 really have public branches for each                                 patch so that you can any possibility of                                 keeping track of them yeah I think we're                                 headed a big technical our financial                                 lower                                 I think that's well-being eating but we                                 all realize that we want to do more                                 sherry if I think that something like                                 harvester if those needs to take a                                 fetish for say top                                                   that I could just as amazed everyone                                 while this room go Tara see patches or                                 maybe top                                                        whatever it'll be a very good start even                                 though its use as a patch level because                                 that's what I currently also do if I                                 have problem and it's it's not reviewed                                 fix I'm start with other dystrophy but                                 now I just go to each and every VCS                                 medellin by myself so it would be step                                 upwards I'm not saying it's easy on you                                 and rook what if you pay for she did was                                 follow us a solid references and then                                 some various distributed version control                                 systems and that's what you mean when                                 you say patch in my                                 penalties but I've spent too many                                 decades living in a world where people                                 passed whoa atomic objects around as if                                 they were really atomic and Colton                                 patches and barefoot way too much and I                                 don't want to look that way sometimes                                 too got past that when you start talking                                 about this talk about naming the patches                                 and so forth I at this one I really sort                                 of do react and I have an allergic                                 reaction to having a conversation in                                 gloves they can care about prevention                                 say yes let's just not do them yeah sure                                 but that's also why i asked a case for                                 Jewel's treatment even yes this is                                 something we already disagreed about                                 them on email which is exactly why we're                                 doing this together because they're                                 multiple angles role is if you have                                 enough obviously having an interesting                                 conversation that is if it was the point                                 of the presentation via recover they                                 spread another discussion that blows                                 the same sort of is if you have an                                 offspring which refuses to unbundle a                                 giri's or even add a configure option to                                 malcolm's to bundle walls etc maybe we                                 should use our right so far I'm sure                                 that a lot of upstream if two top three                                 or four distributions get together and                                 say nearly uniform because you're on                                 this thing's lastly community thank you

maybe something happened to the red                                 protective love Tina be saying as me but                                 of all the districts get together and                                 say we go for I haven't we go alone                                 until                                                                    awesome dr. it was really really sorry                                 but hopefully in some cases it might                                 also how to just do a light before to                                 send a message it's a lot of work for                                 sending a message that's necessarily get                                 the message across well it's adult                                 service command to the other part of                                 what                                 which is the interesting thing about we                                 start talking about how we need to add                                 more meta data around which patches to                                 make it easier for other people to                                 understand at some point you have to ask                                 yourself what's the motivation for                                 somebody to want to add more information                                 more knowledge more                                 than they actually need it's all well                                 you've a little bit more for this a                                 little bit more for that it's what about                                 I think the more information that they                                 are already doing for the distribution                                 it's about well we all document somehow                                 what the patches are for but everybody                                 does it differently so if we could agree                                 on that it would be easier to find                                 that's the only point in defining these                                 things and some point in me then                                 actually somebody has decides to be                                 maintained between the upstream for                                 people working I start wondering at what                                 point somebody just has to say okay it                                 means missing in and bring                                 not just I'm not trying to disagree                                 objective                                 fashion show I'm just it's good at then                                 should document it was all start with a                                 living in bed and maybe a few                                 things and make it a more thing i think                                 i read it and sometimes it says if there                                 is no actually something and if there's                                 everything else it means something will                                 be different I saw examples and it was                                 so I mean I think it was about trusting                                 that and I'm in the boy said it wasn't a                                 rhythm that there is it has to be in                                 what format does it have to be if it was                                 upstream or something like that I don't                                 think that were really to be the details                                 but I know that there was so it was so                                 easy for a human to understand but if                                 somebody misunderstood the policy it                                 might be hard for optimum or some robots                                 to perfect but basically                                 ha                                 I'll tell you                                 ok                                 Ramona                                 we are you foreign fighters                                 I really have the impression that you                                 need to function and you need to also                                 with our                                 kind of watches

or the dimension which would be                                 it's in this amount that is very similar                                 do people this is very similar to what                                 we do now I don't gain several packages                                 for Debian where the upstream so slow                                 ball is not the FSU compliant and so I                                 always bring those in and check them                                 into an upstream mansion and then I have                                 a processing script that automates the                                 maintenance                                 out                                 upstream which then becomes the source                                 for the upstream involved with everyone                                 packaging system and so very much I                                 think sort of Tottenham's I'm an effect                                 creating a sub distribution upstream                                 thing I'm doing all of my you know                                 maintenance work against this week                                 sooner upstream there's really no reason                                 that other people couldn't share that                                 before you have a little bit of                                 everybody else's do something to honor                                 yeah well it certainly took care about                                 freedom within us all oh look at hotel                                 well the Dakota getting rid of all that                                 things at the arm today so about I would                                 just suggest i think we didn't have some                                 practices is the best practices to do                                 this kind of sort of multi-branch man                                 and can it certainly work and other                                 distributed revision process it gets the                                 one I love and I think these can be                                 applied easy if you are managing remotes                                 where it's easy to for me to have in my                                 revision control system a branch that                                 represents more current latest work that                                 I can keep up with                                 okay what are we came to when when we                                 were talking about this presentation we                                 put it on the fold and distribution list                                 and we and other people came in so what                                 we didn't know about and turn out in the                                 discussion where that well basically                                 people like the idea cooperate and work                                 together and things were some of the                                 variables already some we just stopped                                 wiki pages about how to access different                                 version control systems in different                                 distributions and how come down packages                                 it's quite the general                                 and it can use someone to make it more                                 usable also we found out that one thing                                 that I've already talked about was that                                 it might be interesting to create some                                 means how to contact maintainer of all                                 distributions for some package or not                                 really package maybe someone got a great                                 in case I think everybody has a ATT in                                 their distribution of duty and if up                                 steam doesn't provide some lyrics for                                 packages you might be interested in                                 creating one and the welding these lists                                 so if some new distribution games out I                                 will know of workmen twist you should                                 subscribe and hard to discuss packaging                                 of particular application they are                                 interested in also one thing that we all                                 know that might be useful is that we all                                 name out packages somehow and treating                                 them as our boise are                                 you have different policies regarding                                 days and it would be very useful to have                                 something that the mass of wreckage                                 length from one distribution to another                                 actually the various lists we found out                                 that we are already do application theft                                 are trying to do that so we want to use                                 it for the app install or two I think                                 that's when the discussion kames up                                 exclaims up from time up installer say                                 that ETF in Star Wars I mean to name for                                 it as well let me teach you not change                                 the desktop apps and that is the power                                 which is the name is its nest on the                                 best of luck                                 thank you but I'm not sure I don't have                                 that much party istra match is used                                 mainly for applying different                                 well I think this that's another reason                                 that's how we intend to use it I guess                                 the goal in the long term will be to use                                 it to do much more than that                                 so it was all my presentation and while                                 the rest of the time for our mission is                                 reserved for discussion obviously                                 idea for maintaining Frenchie's I didn't                                 go well let me know if you would like to                                 well not only like to but is that                                 anybody who would prefer to share                                 veggies instead of creating this version                                 photo and I mean I think the only the                                 appeal of just extracting patches and                                 collecting them is the initial work is                                 much lower I mean like something like I                                 guess the normal normal normal server                                 low end and if you want to create the                                 repository for each package d better                                 serve the big machine yes because we                                 needs a lot of disk space and stuff or                                 any processing processing power and                                 stuff like that so extracting Texas's                                 like the work that leads to pass the                                 walls                                 the question is whether it's rather than                                 the wrong one they try to go for good to                                 me you seem to be implying that it's                                 necessary to have centralized repository                                 of all this and that isn't that exactly                                 counter to the whole assorted simple as                                 database of pointers to the locations of                                 distributions distributed revision                                 control system of public works for                                 giving package on we're being both                                 relatively cheap to maintain the system                                 overhead standpoint and immensely useful                                 what I would love to have is not so much                                 a if the time to create mappings of                                 things then I would love to have the pcs                                 location information for each of the                                 distributions that's actually keeping                                 that packaged and distributed version                                 control system whether it's good or                                 something else is that that kind of                                 information that                                 that's the set of pointers that you                                 really need to be able to set up a so to                                 remove the point to those things and                                 always sometimes ability to what program                                 is the problem with that is that hotel                                 room for example for laura s switch                                 teams and get for maintaining its                                 packages we didn't get any aspect found                                 a bunch of extras and get is tracking                                 the version of fetch is not on the                                 entire xbox or so you feelin okay us we                                 we are working or some people within I                                 should say I know not involved some                                 people have happy is about reading                                 pudding exploded sources it's so                                 thinking of three part of main branch                                 then what you were describing basically                                 and using that but that is not how r                                 p.m. works that he can get work under on                                 these are here                                 and let this also a problem is that a                                 lot of people who work with it who are                                 not the developers packagers are not                                 always be telling us we are talking                                 about bed sharing and packages we need a                                 lot which need a la fecha samosas the                                 main takers they're related districts                                 are actually developers or Cobra for                                 whatever you want to prove it power a                                 lot of patching in these throws which                                                                                                     submit sort of kind of not that it's a                                 really clear distinction of course with                                 you you catch my great final and I'm not                                 sure if we're going to make things more                                 complicated by intensive by having a                                 district with a version control system                                 we'd have a steeper learning curve                                 what's that going to do to all those                                 packages which just want to package from                                 to which they even think to use with                                 that in the baggage between so not                                 really coders and not really used to                                 working with distributed version control                                 systems every day etc so within Fedora                                 is probably going to be our or a group                                 is working towards this direction but                                 it's probably going to be an opportunity                                 where some packages will save animals                                 who have my entire sources in it                                 councils will just keep doing their old                                 stuff only using kids to have respect                                 better i think that would cause you to                                 be in the same situation as most other                                 distributions and everything for example                                 when                                 the source type event                                 how people create this is very much                                 enjoy so you don't want to go there                                 because you have                                                      nuts not true but the tribe and the                                 student or even finish half as well if                                 you share weapon during pick you up HTC                                 vision of their phone records Korea has                                 posted warning without any which they                                 are you criminalize the part that                                 patient first on fixing documentation                                 that is common or distribution I guess                                 what is very important to share a moment                                 distribution just the same                                 fifth day Cindy's of pieces that such as                                 federal open to the young and Sanjana                                 rain which I find I completely                                 understand it will pretty much time my                                 cook answer to that be at the moment you                                 need to have something more informative                                 than the commit messages associated with                                 the individual passion again really are                                 talking about having a human who is                                 responsible for that in one way or no I                                 don't believe that there's any simple                                 mechanism way that you're going to                                 separate things which are in                                 distribution specific than things which                                 are things you wish upstream would take                                 that hasn't taken yet and lacking is                                 that fully automated                                 the question then is should the burden                                 beyond person who wants to take that fun                                 meaningful things up gunner                                 or is that point be accepted by somebody                                 else                                 and if that bird is accepted by somebody                                 else that somebody else has just become                                 the intermediate maintainer is somewhere                                 between the individual distributions and                                 the original lobster and so to me this                                 is what's a question of Technology and                                 more wanna lose one's volunteer too but                                 I think beautiful sentence when you said                                 that's when the oil fetches which you                                 would like us to take they won't take I                                  think that's something which we need to                                  get better at its distribution is                                  strengthens and numbers suggest ganging                                  up on upstream to put the glove least                                  and just say we we the main takers of                                  this package it is business distribution                                  we really like you to see do something                                  about this point if you don't like our                                  patches and fix it in your own way                                  yes in the end I think there is much                                  more gains because one day long do what                                  you want to happen these bug fixes done                                  only once the proper way to do that is                                  to do with upstream wherever possible                                  very possible and there are other things                                  that I refuse that's why I station                                  strength is in numbers yeah because                                  currently what happens is every                                  distribution is having the discussion                                  about freeing by itself so as simple as                                  the simplest piece of advice from this                                  whole discussion I don't think anyone                                  would disagree with them is if you                                  maintain a piece of software for a                                  particular distribution and you don't                                  already know the people who maintain                                  that same piece of software for all of                                  the other distributions you're failing                                  and you need to go read those people I                                  think that's also a good thing for this                                  nation yet                                  you
