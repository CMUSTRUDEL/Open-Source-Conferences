Title: Can we build a simple, cross-distribution installation frame
Publication date: 2011-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	First, this talk will entail the philosophy behind the shellscript-based Arch Linux installation framework (AIF), as well as some implementation information and lessons learned. Second, I want to initiate a discussion on how multiple distributions could work together maintaining an installation framework following a "keep it simple" philosophy, and how feasible it would be to do so. In my experience, quite some necessities, issues and features are distribution-independent. Specific distributions could be supported with plugins or feature branches.
