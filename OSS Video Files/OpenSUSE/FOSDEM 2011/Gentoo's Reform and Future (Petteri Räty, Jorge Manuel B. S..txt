idea so he was - since I was doing                                this talk about I was chained to what                                would be his future what do we think                                council members and foundation best and                                think about future                                and what type of reforms might be needed                                for change and we start with a bit of                                provocation in case you know the                                background variables that the first line

you don't contribute the number                                should go down so those people have at                                least within the last year or two

software please follow with access to                                the tree who is committed everything in                                the last six months that's as if that's                                about the time I did the last out of                                 retirement so first people that still                                 are the focus with three axis FB                                 disaster University                                 at any point if you have any questions                                 or one interrupt us feel free                                 it's supposed to be plenty of discussion                                 - beside system slides the talk was                                 presented as a debate I think you want                                 to join it but they actually do you know                                 that for jindo comments now we have been                                 able to see who points out all the                                 comments from all the over lights so                                 it's quite more actually for you guys so                                 this is to see but it's already working                                 to see about what it was                                 so the general structure of the talk is                                 that to prove                                 hopefully they'll present some issues                                 and maybe some solutions in some cases                                 and for pity's input from you again and                                 at the end we have discussed and if you                                 have any technical this is more organ on                                 people-oriented any technical questions                                 about the future we do have a timers of                                 the curious session as a follow-up there                                 so if you want to dive into more deeper                                 technical issues this this slide deck                                 doesn't cover those                                 okay so one of the senses that is the                                 meta structure notion through the                                 wetland the project is organized is as                                 been invited for a long time we are the                                 members of the team if you go to gentle                                 slash and Blanchard / yes / meta section                                 there's a metal section across it but                                 that's not and their project was                                 supposed to know what's budgets exist                                 who's working on them and information                                 you have is accountability in service                                 delivery right now there's no there's no                                 facility the project may exist or people                                 will be felt this way and then you're                                 working anything and that's it                                 then there's innovation                                 that's always                                 fresh which is the castle foundation                                 relation which isn't clear and move on                                 and we'll talk about it a bit more later                                 and talk about spirit stuffs which they                                 can manipulate support equipment and                                 factories yes and we'll be able to talk                                 to him a use of the compass split some                                 people say we have the troposphere and                                 the Foundation which we'll talk about                                 more so future but one thing that's it's                                 a bit what this topic that follows the                                 biggest                                 my greatest hope is that we need to have                                 more information we need to have the                                 forces that improve check and also                                 improve Qi and that allow loosen change                                 fight better too controversial topic                                 which comes out every once in a while                                 and is that we have currently everyone                                 has committed access to the mainstream                                 and should people be like X everstyle                                 each while it's small and more uses or                                 or if you have that one huge the yeah if                                 you're in is a level and by the layer                                 ban the one prevailing ideas and instead                                 of the user developers baby that it's                                 done you want to make that status or if                                 you get a user and contribute a single                                 patch here in vice and a position of a                                 developer developer and if you make the                                 entry barrier as little as possible you                                 can solve that was personal issues that                                 you always need more people to                                                                                                   packages or probiem do you have a better                                 estimate ten thousand eight hundred                                 thousand to thirteen thousand thirteen                                 thousand                                 yeah so if you divide those numbers and                                 you'll end up with a pretty pretty much                                 a lot of work for perfect that maybe                                 that he makes next slide how many                                 functions of all country search                                 everywhere well I can't go to the                                 project page and see a list of projects                                 I can even see more if I go to the city                                 estimates the budget but that's about it                                 there listens anyone who really knows                                 how many projects and how they are doing                                 that's the better search of projects

          direction I think or expect some but the                                 history of genitive is that if you want                                 to show up we go and want to do some                                 direction you're being free to do still                                 it's encouraged the air                                 let's see man whoever you knows what is

   for thoughtful users do you really want                                 to have this Gentry's vent is from my                                 perspective not very designed for like                                 even the user to expect everything's                                 working out to the box and this sort is                                 present the place where people go in

you open                                 the page if you go to page called your                                 website called CIN OBC check it tracks                                 comics across

  stressing about the facts and frankly                                 the number of fables the number of plans                                 that there's violent inside Shinto                                 rather we should have a larger scope of                                 packages or whether we should have a                                 narrow scope and focus more than only of                                 those and accuracy and freshness is                                 there we all need to want to set a five                                 people                                 well everyone                                                            work a bit more than others and it's                                 very hard to get everything in perfect                                 shape                                 yeah let's there's two questions from I                                 saw on this topic and I will move on so                                 we can cover more from there you say                                 Mona                                 to get back to the point of this for                                 watch because you said to be powerless                                 in April yes it does                                 so I found it there it's just correct if                                 you understood evangelism a so

that's exactly what beginner users are                                 doing all right because this was the                                 search software by powering so that

additional depicted on Spartacus wrong                                 there is really no reason why I was                                 going to the website except for one time                                 I need results in the handbook and after                                 that there is not that much content                                 rotation thus acting orange drop support

            how to comply networks under the hood                                 and even new users they follow the                                 handle properly for particular forms and                                 things that go quite right camel stalls                                 engine successfully                                 users say have fun to have to start a                                 and spa there because the most old yet                                 because the handbook is only a part of                                 the solution till I brought you this                                 I believe that on that ship is very good                                 distribution for people really want to                                 learn how to work the limits and you                                 don't want to learn of you go to guests                                 and change a cozy setting for our use                                 and the corner mother is sort of package                                 that want to learn how to build packages                                 to configure Apache in this official                                 gentle it's very good because when you                                 if you want to put it works you have to                                 use the goals of each of the projects                                 you don't you do not go to one custom                                 chapter two to configure first so then I                                 think there's one final objective before                                 we have                                    make difficult at all see if they can                                 agree with us yeah basically but I guess                                 the summer is that it's hard to                                 communicate and feel alive considering                                 the amount in Jimmy's or what does they                                 have let's do one get back there were                                 some question time okay yeah I guess the                                 second bit of years that we're                                 addressing we have we have been                                 addressing that's the final caption keep                                 this in mind                                 we'll get to it later                                 one problem is that to get more people                                 involved to avoid dying so the developer                                 accounts go down is the mo people                                 contributing and I don't know you know                                 who from whom the comment was that it's                                 too hard to get involved over acuity or                                 whatever it was cool say that                                 weird questions about little triangle                                 metal stuff which is actually a monopoly                                 related                                 we will hardcore coding yeah but                                 basically the province here and it's uh                                 it's super power quarters perspective                                 it's tedious and you need to know stuff                                 like let's see what is the foundation                                 how you become a member and other                                 example are mmm is should you what maybe                                 we should you follow and how should you                                 use many miss headers to pose to them                                 and things like that the idea here is                                 that there's a balance between if it's a                                 little bit tedious then you're more                                 likely to stick around after do we going                                 through the trouble and then the balance                                 of course that if it's too easy to get                                 common access then it's AG Quinn                                 nightmare finality able to push it this                                 vehicle would access or not into box but                                 the state the next slide and press that                                 and I am the guy who's in charge of the                                 process so here I am from him I'm ready                                 for consults and inputs                                 Patrick one thing is there there's                                 quality of developers that retire for a                                 year or two and then try to return and                                 that process is somehow totally broken                                 because they take the longest time which                                 is a bit weird because I mean they                                 already know all of this                                 they just need a small refresher they                                 want to work and without the native then                                 they take as much time as new people                                 which is like on time probably only                                 reactive in the sense that I Steve for                                 example on some bug reports hey this                                 user is posting on every buck for this                                 packet and then I contact this user that                                 we have no listening post well users can                                 just say hey I want to thank where do I                                 start                                 if you don't mind if they said an email                                 to include they still get to reply                                 and these days how many people do they                                 find out okay is that you need space                                 that's a report but what I'm saying is                                 like no mouse but to catch you I                                 understand if they mail the groups are                                 still going to reply and the Vatican can                                 confirm that in basically it isn't                                 taking that long together I'm not the                                 only one we find quite a few people to                                 start applying and we're trying to do it                                 bigger but if you don't mind                                 it's its it can be just a brutal we who                                 decide at the end of section have they                                 need to be letters and you do it but                                 pretty much you do it by                                            don't                                 my personal goal is make myself week on                                 them and I think every death should try                                 to do it to recruit people so that                                 basically everything you do is covered                                 by at least someone else so if you just                                 walk away gently still continues and it                                 gives you also that time to do the                                 exciting stuff and you're not all the                                 time just you know second version bombs                                 and all the annoying boring stuff                                 move in okay well I would like to get                                 back to the point is it too hard I would                                 say no it's not from harmful actually                                    should be much more about the details                                 and about because you talked about QA I                                 don't care so much about policies that                                 fault he's been and just to get homework                                 but the real needs                                 let's take a quick count if you are                                 considerable contributing as a district                                 level over for a certain amount of time                                 are you willing to fill out the                                 paperwork please raise your hand if you                                 are I think there's no question yeah                                 well basically you get access to bump                                 the packages you maintain whenever you                                 want and you get the shiny email address                                 where do you become already anything                                 myself well Robin sauce to me it was a                                 way to contribute back I'm being                                 actually open software quite a few years                                 and I've learned a lot from using it so                                 you cannot refer to this thing and I                                 think most open source developers                                 Sheffield it I was a debt developer once                                 the reason why I left was just could                                 because of a primaries that I had                                 periods of four five one that I could                                 not contribute so in the policy said                                 okay you can be a developer anymore                                 because can contribute constantly good                                 so now I'm becoming bit more active                                 again I know that in two months I'm                                 going to stop for four months again so I                                 know I'm not going to ask for for                                 developers ship but if I then take a                                 look at what I'm doing right now it's                                 the same as what I did when I was                                 developer so I don't see what what what                                 more I could gain from becoming it                                 that's the point is what about the one                                 of the point is that it's probably too                                 hard to complete you it as a user and we                                 want we would like to make it easier as                                 soon I guess                                 besides the get migration there's I                                 don't have any fresh idea                                 but we do the integration test idea for                                 one of one of the nine principles                                 Washington since the part is that if a                                 person affects us                                                  changed but it's something that we                                 really have is saying well okay most                                 users can't give form to the five track                                 to get ready or to communicate yourself                                 so that's fine occupies and if you find                                 a way to someone who just wants to spend                                 one or two all the sweet catchable them                                 there yes okay                                 he'll XKE that's it makes it's just                                 kitty know it works on paper packages                                 the given package to the people to team                                 works with him six is the thousand                                 particular that what indeed as a good                                 work so that's that important but it is                                 something really to discuss because that                                 will change the way that shampoo                                 currently is splitting axles and                                 I think just restricted to excess                                 capacity and I said in these two                                 comments on this topic and that                                 yeah                                 and sometimes it's about pissing about                                 that is imported and sometimes it's                                 about I want to use and which is                                 imported and labor is fantastic too and                                 at the point when I got my my paper for                                 storage with my overnight included in                                 the lab and this is business                                 to go

since you can buy                                 this book yeah but if you think you we                                 don't want bigger exposure to those                                 packages to ultimately users I'm                                 assuming only a very small percentage of                                 ejected users have you over the

is maybe                                 a better approach you know you're                                 talking about scattering                                 there's splint access about

vacuum                                 as the foundation was pretty weak unlike                                 this term at that time there was they                                 didn't have any

Jensen it will                                 be general manager                                 not a lot changes foundation remains                                 Pintus legal NC technical becomes

counsel is they're                                 legally protected by the foundation if                                 they do something that to screw up this                                 stands at the violent council members                                 who are not foundation members there can                                 be some would be exposed on individually                                 for their their liability and by the                                 sinner so there's some protection for                                 council members there in certainly not                                 much changes                                 well they can between the council and                                 the foundation for like I say the last

       that's why this is why it's important to                                 move in this direction so that we can                                 approach other other corporations in the

     because there's since the foundation                                 almost failed in                                                     very few people to step up want to be

                         were collected on folks it's very likely                                 I don't see it happening until the                                 historical until the instructors

think of at least one                                 that won't be no name but it's very                                 simple to find because there's no need                                 to change any foundation piles                                 so in summary I see into going is                                 regularize the corporate structure                                 mostly
