Description: 
	Debian has also several unique technical features, still unmatched by concurrent newfangled distributions (and more of those are coming with Debian Squeeze!).Even more importantly, Debian is unique in: (1) its independence from money, infrastructure, people power, and similar "features" that companies use to control the progress of free software distributions; (2) its culture of freedom and democracy, which are both at stake with company-driven decisions on the evolution of free software distributions.

	                              for the directions one of the point                               which was made before so I think that                               every distribution should actually make                               very clear what are they a reason for                               its existence the goal with us to play                               and these talk is about the specific                               things about Lebanon which I think the                               survey should be using solution and in                               place of some of the father's sometimes                                here mother so I'll talk about that in                                with this slides which is a quote from                                Ian Botham we've from the Debian in                                     and better then he said something like                                follow the little stir this was a Balkan                                music this is just for now the minute                                complexion of a grand new legal                                strategies which I'm calling techno                                little sweaty so in                                                  father David was about to be completed                                we are here                                                          completing with probably never so still                                in that measure of some of their ISM                                which go to the creation of that so one                                of the goal was to make a new complexion                                distribution still able to compete with                                commercial grading systems was to make a                                distribution easy to install also the                                notion of the                                to install back then was not exactly the                                same there today also you made the point                                of having this solution with                                collaboratively by software expects                                meaning people that know the software                                they're packaging rather than they only                                know the actual packaging techniques and                                it was historically the first major                                distribution development in this or more                                properly in the spirit of you know and                                in the beginning was also founded by the                                nonprofit so now we are seventeen years                                later than that we have a distribution                                with a                                                              everybody is twelve time there are                                studies happened this night we are like                                one thousand developers doing Debian                                above                                                                   host and porters and then a couple of                                thousand of contributors all over the                                world we are probably the largest number                                of reports across Mason distribution yet                                                                                                    normally no sports is our favor gisli                                   and                                                                     of parts including the new hard part                                which Balaji in America which is                                probably the most advanced and farad for                                existing and we are just phone something                                like one of the                                            distributions according to this to watch                                so overall I think that                                five mainstream so that'sthat's very                                good question so it's kind of difficult                                and I've used the popularity                                distribution which I've seen out there                                and there are sites ranking distribution                                according to popularity but IP is not a                                clear-cut definition is just what I can                                find out there using a bunch of people                                talk about it on the web and dispenser I                                have no other better position                                actually if I be comparing that the                                change you are not which one is all                                those numbers from martial arts I am no                                idea I really have no idea so I think                                best investigators using the website for                                distribution and have a look at the top                                list or some data yeah but if you are                                yes okay so is there any size and I                                suppose yes so how many possible                                but how do you define this price one of                                the largest number of folks yeah okay                                still things changed significantly from                                                                                                    other distributions of both and it is                                basically just one of them there are                                tons of them so and some of the other                                disturb it is more often and again some                                of them are very tight within schedules                                at the six-month some more users and                                Debian so that will be still innovate                                more if that means something                                some of they're getting more credit                                WordPress suppose about a fixed and                                existent and onion and there are a whole                                lot for the fad about that so what a                                nice reasonably ask so could the bloody                                hell cares about that which by the way I                                was trying expressions is pretty simple                                in general what might wonder is that it                                 is still relevant and more generally as                                 we see before what is the role of Debian                                 in the current ecosystem of whistle so I                                 - main argument which make me believe                                 that they mean is still relevant runs                                 more than hand the first reason is that                                 I think some things better comes and                                 there is a mixture of features which are                                 quite unique and which I think we should                                 be you should keep in mind the first one                                 is a focus of work so I think very                                 strong focus and package point and                                 that's come from various aspects of a                                 stringent policy of our packages should                                 look like which is called the dragon                                 policy we have extensive testing of                                 packages to check whether they match                                 this policy are not automatically when                                 the stress testing of packages to check                                 if they're installable in all possible                                 configurations and you know possible                                 upgrade runs and we are expensive it                                 tests for rebuilding their car and                                 that's very important because this                                 software is useful and one of the                                 freedom which gives you is ability to                                 change your software but if you                                 not forbidden you're soft and wants to                                 change it that's something is wrong then                                 free software is just a potential that                                 you are not being able to fully explore                                 and then the polisher very amazed that                                 that is mundane is in there are usually                                 software experts but that mean that when                                 you are both about about for instance a                                 scientific application usually you                                 usually ended up talking with someone                                 which the next bit of that scientific                                 field so that really has in terms of                                 user support and all the packages in                                 archive so we don't have first class of                                 second glance packages in principle all                                 of them require to be fly back to the                                 same standard point and what we say that                                 they're gonna release when it's ready so                                 the point is really that we are not                                 willing to train our quality                                 requirements is some dead language set                                 of it so this is a first feature that                                 they think it's quite important and                                 again package all the forms in them a                                 second fifth second two points is                                 software freedom that's like some                                 obvious to the supporter but effective                                 is not so there has been promoting free                                 software values in                                                      bottom up and with that I mean two                                 things the first one is that all the                                 software you get in there in is free                                 software including feel okay but that's                                 probably very soft and the second thing                                 is that in the infrastructure we use to                                 make the area is completely free no one                                 indigent with the will accept our                                 developer oriented service which is not                                 free software and then user would not                                 for sure except we have to use non free                                 services to for instance report back for                                 this console                                 I really completely I think it's it's                                 important to see that you show that we                                 are able to do our institutional using                                 on this vessel and community the                                 pigmenting knows and toss them in to be                                 faithful through these principles and                                 all this I think such a high bar for                                 first of the supporters around the world                                 you kind of compare with that in terms                                 of how much are we free and how much I                                 would know                                 Third Point is independent so again is                                 an independent distribution being that                                 there is no single company which is                                 associated today and that is quite                                 important we how do we live that if you                                 don't if we don't have a single single                                 company the visiting up well we see the                                 donations money for people there are                                 companies different comments from them                                 to them or money from our conference for                                 instance and everything else is gift                                 account so it's an exchange of work                                 among developers and this is quite                                 remarkable among popular distribution of                                 mention distribution because if you                                 think of many other solutions usually                                 you can associate them to single                                 contents and this is very important                                 because one can trust                                 they've been choice enough to be driven                                 by profit when some principle that                                 people try to of all those principle and                                 everything does it doesn't mean the last                                 point we say ghosts are a very neat                                 feature I mean is I would take it                                 serious and we take the decision by a                                 mixture of do what I call a democracy                                 and a democracy                                 so the Orcas is just really the usual                                 way we could think infrastop so I mean                                 someone working on something is free can                                 take the decision he wants in that                                 specific topic and this is something                                 which is guaranteed by the deficit but                                 then we have also a democratic process                                 which one can take this is all together                                 and cover up when you oversee pay but                                 you shouldn't be used that only for                                 principle decision not really for                                 technicals so this is pretty very good                                 fine and in the consequence of that is                                 that repetition the project follows                                 works so you are no well known in the                                 deposit if you have done a lot of work                                 it's your body and it means so that                                 there is really no benevolent dictator                                 or even the prosecutor is just someone                                 who actually coordinated activities not                                 something who takes the season in place                                 of us and more generous means that there                                 are no imposed decision on how the                                 project will                                 by who is demanded by you owns the                                 infrastructure where you avoid people on                                 what is commerce so all together this is                                 this made my first argument why it's                                 things that it should live long and                                 prosper                                 because in general I think we really                                 need in the distribution market players                                 which are which are independent from the                                 need of money and which can be trusted                                 for for some specific principles so what                                 I'm worried about not having such                                 players in the arena is that one day                                 distribution which are run by companies                                 might I mean does that conflict with the                                 needle person and more than adding                                 independently guarantee that other                                 distribution which are may be associated                                 to complain we will have demands their                                 company to become more independent to be                                 able more and more to drive their phone                                 so that was my first argument so I think                                 independent player is feel principle and                                 agreement about that to the community                                 and my second argument is that there is                                 a difference of you stream of their even                                 in these two movies so very quickly what                                 is a driver the distribution is                                 essentially applying some specific free                                 software freedoms to a half so you take                                 an existing distribution you patch and a                                 bit back as you add some new packages if                                 you need and then you steal that to your                                 users and periodically you synchronize                                 with the distribution you started from                                 this is kind of leery side to have a                                 driver distribution and we have seen a                                 lot of them and the only thing they are                                 getting changes because with derivatives                                 the project which are creating a                                 distribution can focus on the                                 customization I think do I use and on                                 the back of the work being able to work                                 more specifically on a specific set of                                 target users                                 and everybody wins if we do this problem                                 wait because the derivative and                                 massively will use other work and that's                                 clear as anything and the muddled easter                                 of the solution where everybody's come                                 from the reach out to new users and                                 probably for public that you wouldn't be                                 able to reach out to if it was not for                                 the for the day so that in specifically                                 is being a base for a lot of diamonds so                                 according to district watch we have like                                                                                                       are a lot of them and the reason why I                                 think those distribution decided to base                                 their work on them in these four reasons                                 so guarantees of quality on packages and                                 uncheck in licensing for the film being                                 going in that in is a very solid base                                 system and we have a huge collection of                                 packages with                                                         and we tend to be we have this model                                 being the universal writing system                                 meaning that we are not specifically                                 customized for specific target visited                                 so it's pretty it should be really easy                                 to customize that for specific                                 certifications there is this - devotion                                 you might have                                 and that's not right not generally the                                 most known example of second derivative                                 so it was started in                                                   isn't that in there you got the gist                                 very popular so if you look at possible                                 data for instance you see that he                                 probably has a user Bay which is                                    times lives of is Italian and he's an                                 archivist kind of destroyed was fit in                                                                                                          part was more working on the main when                                 the community was working the unions and                                 it's heavily customized in May so we are                                 also independent packages of several                                 things author and it very close to the                                 game has so in this picture what you see                                 is the amount of packages which are                                 shipped by able to do their users                                 according to whether they are unmodified                                 again packages they are like                                          for links there are                                               packages which are modified that                                 indicated and there are about seven                                 percent of packages which are upstream                                 software not that is so okay and the                                 damage who would is not the only one                                 there is a huge tree there are many                                 other distributions based directly on                                 Damien and also starting to get worse                                 between both so the bundestag t                                   derivatives and derivatives of                                 derivatives and so on and so forth                                 what is happening is that they ended up                                 being at the rules of a huge tree of                                 distribution                                 which everything depend on that and this                                 will be and this is so even if your                                 distribution does not tell you that so                                 although the tribution are doing very                                 very good at customized software but for                                 everything else they rely on the work                                 astounded so just some concluding focus                                 on that so what I think is happening                                 recent in recent years is that the                                 software distribution pipeline has a                                 change so this is how it looks like like                                 five ten years ago so we used to add an                                 upstream software here to use some                                 vendors and distribution here which                                 basically affected the software for the                                 final noodles and then we have some                                 flows among the various islands so                                 useful software with software which                                 flows from that crime by great works and                                 batches for miraculous but now this is                                 being changed quite a lot in recent                                 years and now we have got very long for                                 that guide long pipeline of software                                 solution so we are lasting here we might                                 have another distribution in between                                 like that again we might have another                                 distribution here which is and so on and                                 so forth okay and again we you should                                 have the same flow of software and                                 batches that we use where before so                                 something should flow from left to right                                 and by patches back the variables and                                 back we should flow from right to left                                 and all this is wonderful because                                 freedom scrat's                                 so every single link we are in the chain                                 potentially which having new users                                 that's good for everything for everyone                                 so                                 and we get more eyeballs which can fix                                 more bugs and we also get more potential                                 photographers but we should be very                                 where else detected all this should be                                 for the sustainable because if funding                                 links means that links before anything                                 suffer then we have a father and Moga we                                 should be we should care about the fact                                 that have all this actually benefits not                                 individual distributions or individuals                                 of the politic but rather free software                                 as a whole so I also saw the free side                                 which I think you should all keep in                                 mind to make that happen and the recycle                                 a reservation that free software is                                 keeping in mind that the goal is free                                 software is not the benefit of an                                 individual if it always bigger than any                                 single project than any single                                 distribution then I didn't do content                                 and every other supplemental out there                                 and if you care about the software that                                 we should take care of that each link in                                 this chain we give back changes so if we                                 change something at any point the change                                 we should try to give those changes back                                 on the left and we should also take care                                 of the fact that users should know where                                 the work they are using kind so making                                 clear who is working on what because                                 it's useful for users to know and to                                 direct that way so coming back to the                                 question the leave name is it for so put                                 the bloody Clara cares about that I                                 think you should                                 and I think so for two reasons so first                                 of all because there is still progress a                                 cocktail of features which are we                                 taken all together with your honor and                                 also because they can be started in the                                 root of our youth center distributions                                 which actually benefit from tests                                 now that the defense of course there are                                 some that are less active but there are                                 some automated machines we also build                                 but yeah there it's probably true that                                 some other pictures harmless                                 but the very least                                 they work in                                 some solid parts are                                 such an issue because we should think                                 about the product which serves the main                                 light now the question is varies at the                                 collaboration between their ethics is                                 not that good and how can we improve                                 where we is users to Google you can use                                 this again actually I would say that                                 it's not that full                                 it used to be working tell me what it is                                 now anything better than that                                 so for instance we'll set up a point                                 which is the negatives for us which is                                 actually my first spam slide and it's a                                 con                                 the point where we invite all                                 distribution based on them either                                 directly or transitively actually join                                 together and use that point to discuss                                 how to push never changes back to that                                 but the problem is the same discussing                                 in the sessions before this one if you                                 want to push something back to that then                                 maybe you don't know how to do that they                                 do you even know you should contact to                                 do that and this is an easy thing to fix                                 them so I think it's getting better and                                 better and precedence I think the point                                 is that before these success stories                                 that the boomers will tell about their                                 users meet me we were not very aware of                                 the form because all other distribution                                 were used changing very little of that                                 and I mean they just reported back and                                 they really didn't need to collaborate a                                 lot with us why with the Rufus pieces                                 change and I think it's we should fix                                 the problem there so that we set up very                                 example case for have any other                                 distribution of their not only their                                 name so how you can use as users well                                 that's a good question of a second ever                                 think about that so first of all I think                                 you should communicate about the fact                                 that where the words come from because                                 its usual to know general it is useful                                 to know that there is a collaboration of                                 projects which are working together to                                 actually deliver some specific software                                 and maybe push for pushing changes back                                 when that is not happening by its                                 you're mentioned of exam rooms as the                                 vendor agent that no I don't think so                                 I think I mention it as a as a discount                                 and office hours for the ideas                                 it's a beautiful stretch okay I'm                                 choosing Goodman okay thanks guys                                 sponge light which is the new squeezer
