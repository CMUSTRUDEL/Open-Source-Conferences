Title: Who the bloody hell cares about Debian? (Stefano Zacchiroli)
Publication date: 2011-02-07
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	Debian has also several unique technical features, still unmatched by concurrent newfangled distributions (and more of those are coming with Debian Squeeze!).Even more importantly, Debian is unique in: (1) its independence from money, infrastructure, people power, and similar "features" that companies use to control the progress of free software distributions; (2) its culture of freedom and democracy, which are both at stake with company-driven decisions on the evolution of free software distributions.
