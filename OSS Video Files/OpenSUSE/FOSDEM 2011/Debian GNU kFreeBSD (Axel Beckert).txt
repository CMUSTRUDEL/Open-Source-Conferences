Description: 
	apt-get install freebsd?This talk will show you what Debian GNU/kFreeBSD exactly is, what the differences between Debian GNU/kFreeBSD and the well known Debian GNU/Linux are, what difficulties the developers had, especially with regards to packaging and infrastructure, and what design decisions where made to get so far that Debian GNU/kFreeBSD finally has been accepted as Debian release architecture and what you can do with it but not with Debian GNU/Linux or with plain FreeBSD.

was a slack                               relation to the video games we see all                               the nectar no slides yeah what I was                               talking about yeah                               combining vs teesta and linux stuff                               always little bit airy from the                               philosophy minor field so yeah what we                                have here is a pastor at my opinion and                                my opinion anyway open source at its                                best because you can you have taken two                                things which were never went to work                                together and make them work together                                because photo open source free software                                so yeah what is first of all about what                                is KPBS need exactly does the name for                                come from especially the K so why did we                                do this then in the differences between                                during gnu/linux and dip into creativity                                as well as different between three bc                                and Debbie UK tht about similar projects                                then a little bit about typically issues                                we had when developing that the                                operating system what is still missing                                Nash is still stuff which doesn't work                                it oh it's not yet available what will                                the future bring and finally some links                                the sources etc where you can find more                                information                                yeah what is they being location we seek                                safety it's a port in the sense of tebya                                so it's it's own architecture so like                                debian hot spa as living little                                sunflower dipping noodles on Alpha on                                                                                                        means also the step again has several                                machines which are specifically for the                                architecture who are in the architecture                                they are                                                         machines with every division developer                                has access to so the whole                                infrastructure covers also the this I                                tricked or more or less these two                                architectures because also as taking to                                linux we have a                                                  version of debian HP Wisty sometimes you                                can see also k k dash I in Danish a as                                application for those two because they                                are quite long architecture names and a                                little bit looking back april two                                thousand nine debian ok Felicity became                                officially part of living archive and                                left its yeah children home at the bean                                pods or so                                that has been released this night just                                few hours ago together with debian                                   squeeze and we call it on yeah                                technology preview so it is released                                together with speech but it is not as                                stale as we as we expected from                                something which comes from debian so                                there are few things just don't work                                that perfect yet but nevertheless you                                have something you can use it's out                                there on the muse yeah another question                                which is often asked is can i install a                                linux and a KGB sticker on the same                                installation you can i or can i switch                                between you at the moment the answer's                                no but in the future that we may be with                                mikey arch support a possibility to be                                able to use something like that but not                                at the moment so you can't just say our                                cat installed freebsd but on the other                                hand since kim Debbie Annette version if                                you don't see                                                       hatred is different sources on normal                                debian gnu/linux if you want to                                get it for the book what it is exactly                                just a strange names still so debian you                                know stands for the technique free                                software guidelines for a package for up                                and family for a Debian installer and                                for the well-known work solid stable                                uses you have a new which stands for the                                GFC or the embedded she did see which is                                used in debian it sends for the new                                zealand mostly so who ponytails I guess                                I am and B and many more form a loop                                project and it sends for the rock-solid                                pvt kernel and it's ok and this one                                because it's yeah it's just the quran                                from Phoebe's t plus some kernel of rice                                is simulated command line tools the                                whole thing started back in two thousand                                fill five with five codex kernel series                                from BBC and currently available our                                seventh or three only in unstable and                                 squeeze has been released with you                                 d QR eight one and the same one is also                                 being solid                                 so and as with linux kernel's newer                                 versions of the freebsd kernel will come                                 into a bit unstable or at some time                                 maybe also only experimental but                                 nevertheless they will flow in as they                                 do so we had a case mostly for it's the                                 kind of BBC why what is just because we                                 can someone wanted to do it someone took                                 some time and made it work initially you                                 can see as combining the advantages of                                 the Debian system like yeah having                                 stable releases having the package                                 system having the finger feel of a                                 debian system but with some advantages                                 of freebsd having food samples NFS etc                                 there's a whole wiki page and type in                                 begin about the question because there                                 are so many different answers for it one                                 thing you sometimes he is by the                                 performance of phonics did some was                                 already picked like a while                                 it's a performance test and it depends                                 on usage so some things are more                                 performed with the freebsd kernel at                                 that time and some things were more                                 performed with linux kernel some things                                 were performed with both                                                 and                                                                 chest was made without the                                           which has super pages which has a set to                                 have a little bit impact wonderful was                                 defending one of the performance of the                                 freebsd kernel so yeah probably should                                 do a new performance test and see what's                                 the current case and one thing which I                                 didn't notice for quite a while but                                 other portals noticed since there was                                 quite some publicity I want them in                                 location VSD people tried using it found                                 bugs fix them many were based on warm                                 ups assumptions how lipsy works together                                 with Joanna etc and when those folks in                                 Cajun is to be affixed suddenly were                                 also fixed what I've in New hurt because                                 they often had the same problems later                                 on that details                                 why not the bsd lexi well we tried to                                 back in I think                                                          to combine the Phoebus teen lipsy Phoebe                                 see Colonel together with a flute                                 userland and it didn't work out they                                 also try to do them with net PST as well                                 and yeah just didn't work out the                                 project died i think at end of two                                 thousand two or so and yeah they had the                                 lipsy from the BST obvious so there was                                 no k in the name was forgiving who BBC                                 of them in the PST but obviously the                                 version with the nudity was more                                 successful comparing it with a freebsd                                 you have a well some say teenis                                 interfaces less often changing you have                                 the open sound system yeah yeah not that                                 many contributors for the more stable                                 community contributing yep in general                                 set a more stability with vb city and of                                 course you have a lot of stuff it just                                 don't inconvenience at the moment                                 the packet filter the EF firewall setup                                 as support natively supported in the                                 colonel so if you want some of that FS                                 maybe that's something for you it seems                                 important since after your so for the                                 root file system support in top two                                 first set of s and in the Debian                                 installer then there are chains rd                                 choice for performance measurements and                                 the other end this drivers which can                                 include i think windows finally drivers                                 of give them in the mainline club on the                                 other end of many packages have less for                                 features or are just not available                                 because they're using Linux only stuff                                 mostly either or wireless stuff or the I                                 notify Colonel interface for getting a                                 few weeks tail output or something so                                 yeah                                 on the other end combined with freebsd                                 you have Deepika cheer up and the old                                 family if all software coming                                 pre-compiled all                                                        less with them in a few steep let's say                                 about                                                                  need to download them install them and                                 they are there on your machine no                                 running releases in the parts of                                 packages so once you use the stable of                                 these you don't get new cups features                                 when you want just one security updates                                 you have a foxy making the same amount                                 of faults and packages and PVC as well                                 in JVL so no big difference there and as                                 with the Linux system with oh nice the                                 leaves can release with the main squeeze                                 we have now non-free finally only                                 drivers in the kernel with freebase t                                  unfortunately the autumn automatic                                 loading of the drivers ma probably                                 working it so you may have some problems                                 with some network drive is mostly the                                 wireless stuff um                                 yeah similar approach is ever quite oh                                 well some around there's a wikipedia                                 page about those pork new variants so                                 you're outside the game to freebsd which                                 is not as i think portage for the to                                 freebsd so you have the whole zhengzhou                                 eagles available on tbsteam but i wasn't                                 able to get any up-to-date information                                 about the project i asked them can                                 gentoo energy better person thing for me                                 well yeah that existed something but i                                 have no idea this still is still alive                                 so anyone can give me an update here I                                 would be happy and yeah that was where                                 the troop estd pc-based a bein a                                 virgin's check in                                                     company called nexenta codec for those                                 stores which is basically opensolaris or                                 combined with the new userland they were                                 family based on debian now they use                                 ubuntu as their face not sure how they                                 will continue now with the opensolaris                                 seen less support for molecule and                                 there's also                                 we mentioned a maneuver which is                                 actually no buster but just decided way                                 because that was the gun always taught                                 for the new user hand to get the                                 operating system yeah typically issues                                 we had one built dependency so stuff                                 which depended on other packages only                                 available on linux for all architectures                                 so we haven't had to just add this                                 dependency it's all about it on the                                 linux-based architectures then also in                                 anymore i think the project shift in the                                 upstream troubles outdated config danza                                 conflict of guests files so when you try                                 to compile it and it didn't knew about                                 the architecture that was usually easy                                 to fix by copying up-to-date copy is in                                 to their into the package then something                                 we should fight us quite recently last                                 few months some KGB is the only race                                 conditions for example we had to pick                                 out gdm the knob gen                                              version of the version number two                                 because it lost its                                 he bought more or less due to wait for                                 waste condition on startup so if you                                 reset it once it worked but not on the                                 internet startup of the system the same                                 fact was in KTM but there it will fix                                 and GD m                                                             have only gdm                                                            at the moment and if that will probably                                 not change any more because the no.                                  people are going to focus on gdm free                                 and other the version                                                  we had to bootstrap up that path                                 initially that was maybe little bit                                 easier because we also had already had a                                 few freebies g so we could bootstrap                                 debian part on a freebsd installation                                 and even the original engine the first                                 installer we ship it until maybe you're                                 one and half ago was raped fee-based                                 installer and if you have followed                                 exactly the instructions in every key                                 which in which set should choose which                                 point you were solid in a wax is because                                 one single point in a standard                                 installation there was a fetch in which                                 star basically the boot strip and put                                 the system on only if you didn't go to                                 that half you had half PhDs febc system                                 of debian system and                                 you could start from beginning and of                                 course you have with with water machines                                 when we needed for the machines yet well                                 one of the criteria to be two nations to                                 have at least one debbie end developer                                 obsessed with portal machine and also                                 give teams with an architecture and all                                 for the machines usually want to be in                                 stable but for they being who carefully                                 stick there was no they be in stable yet                                 so in the very beginning we had debbie                                 an unstable on the father machines which                                 also had sometimes problems because you                                 have less the incest it's unsafe it                                 sometimes and at some point i think you                                 go so we moved to debian testing at that                                 point so way less updates weightless                                 breaking the photo machines and yeah                                 soon we will one day be in stable on the                                 bottom sheets to for this architectures                                 these architectures and                                 so yep what's missing okay um those                                 photo machines are currently um yeah in                                 setting at our University at the cage                                 too I'm one of the maintainer running of                                 running the admins of the running the                                 photo machines and so we're responsible                                 for you are getting built dependencies                                 installed if someone wants to test some                                 of these packages on the architectures                                 etc that's basically the connection of                                 my my workplace whether they nuke a few                                 EST gamma that shouldn't a lot of stuff                                 missing a fuse that's a little bit                                 annoying so there's there are no fuse                                 userland utilities at the moment there's                                 a project accord fuse for bsd but no one                                 has package done yet ipv                                               Harry because you have to use the free                                 whiskey the original freebsd comment on                                 utilities which are not in the half                                 because the records which is which have                                 been waitin around it to give the                                 freebsd                                                                  interface as the linux ones and to make                                 it up down bored                                 they don't have ipv                                                   it's quite ugly yes then what's also                                 missing is due to support then there is                                 an eye notifying KQ compatibility layer                                 so that tool to choose the BBC                                       choose the I notify interface of linux                                 kernel can be compiled on freebsd and                                 use the BBC's hate you but that                                 compatibility layer is not yet in giving                                 a free whiskey so no I notify there yet                                 and then some less important CBC's basic                                 specific tools like the mouse teammate                                 are not available to get the most                                 English responsible for showing mouse on                                 the text console-like GPM does on linux                                 but a real graphical most girls like you                                 know from X like this one um tool to                                 chef included in the last year which one                                 in there before into

        all packages away the debian are not                                 available in timing bouquet PVC and that                                 number is quite stable since let's a                                 year or so and none of the year and                                 happy because one year ago we had up to                                 eighty percent of packages missing                                                                                                        packages                                 well just problems of on the                                        version of the beginning for us d                                 because at that time Tesla didn't                                 compile on a freebsd would seem to be                                 quite a lot of packages that this and                                 there are most of the packages which are                                 missing are nearing specific packages or                                 packages which realized wrong you had                                 some little specific features there's a                                 beauty there in awe of you can get some                                 statistics about which architecture is                                 how many percent of packages of course                                 none of the architectures has                                      because there are quite a few packages                                 which are specific to one single hard                                 picture like for example the spa improve                                 little slow de macedo this spa holy and                                 you won't have that on any eye other eye                                 texture and of course they are also some                                 KGB ste only packages like the HP                                 whiskey cars okay um so in between the                                 future there's something coming up                                 another case USD based artist in the mix                                 well Mila is working                                                     so there will be a few snippets and                                 don't debian pods probably next one up                                 here here I don't know in all set on the                                 mailing list month ago or so that is                                 working on that and theoretically                                 impossible are even more I pictures but                                 basically they're quite some I textured                                 steady and support as well as PVC                                 supports but I think as long there is no                                 well need or interest in I don't think                                 they will show up so probably the old                                 architecture select spark of all this                                 you won't see okay from this teapot but                                 maybe arm as it's very popular in the

                    you said something a little to install                                 is the same she presumably this is not                                 being alone with the same file system or                                 is also cover if you want to and                                 vegetable the package is not fit                                    different yeah what I mean is going to                                 be impossible to that's the plan is that                                 when working out is available that you                                 x                                                                   systems are back garden support you can                                 have an installation with different                                 libraries and by the fire packages                                 currently possible to boot with several                                 funky                                 separate files a do it good guesses                                 games here as both up moving by refugee                                 that's possible just not over the same                                 gidc at the moment but you can share you                                 can share files for some bones between                                 such installations but you should use X                                                                                                         but now it's David White support info                                 info x                                                               exercising be busy probably would also                                 be                                 available for live in the ghetto if                                 there's a well I think they you can get                                 it count if you if the problem is really                                 also present in the Debian package for                                 of your software or if you expect that                                 it will be available will be for example                                 if you develop a new release and you                                 think there are issues with HD HD for I                                 think the message way for upstream                                 developers is first to contact with                                 debian maintainer of the package and                                 together I have a look at it but you can                                 basically everyone who wants to help on                                 that port should be able to and so if                                 there's need for I don't think we will                                 deny question it's just not that we want                                 to give our shell share the accounts to                                 anyone who just asks it will be                                 free shuttle service for New York                                 attention oh yeah tryna requires                                 resource let me make me deep yeah it's                                 also it's good if you give you at least                                 know where to where the people where you                                 can reach those people just someone                                 writes from some gmail account without                                 any meaning in there hi I want a shell                                 account there without reason or relation                                 to some octopus project I'm quite                                 relieved or can we also already had                                 issues on those machines with too much                                 IFC trafficking coming from those                                 machines so we have a little bit to take                                 care about the University who we chose                                 the machines at the moment because here                                 we just gotta make it from the network                                 security that this box their suspected                                 Meg horse                                 whatever it's doing a lot of strange and                                 I received traffic is this moment yeah I                                 sure there isn't any bad wave on it yes                                 I wonder what PhD people are thinking                                 about this event of combines the v SD                                 card is clue which see and well there's                                 a seems to be quite a lot of well that's                                 a corporation there are quite some PST                                 people on the Debian PS gmail is only                                 one hand quite some pictures made for                                 debian ok Felicity have been accepted in                                 previously itself not all obviously                                 there are few changes about I think of                                 stuff like that questions I don't know                                 any specific action now but I know that                                 there are changes where to look for                                 things which are not suitable for PVC                                 itself but there is definitely a quite a                                 lot of contact between the well let's                                 call it our legacy hackers and the few                                 VST guys and I don't count myself to the                                 lipsy hackers and see myself more as a                                 marketing guy for the KGB stick for                                 so I'm a user of a system administrator                                 and have fun with that thought so I                                 think I should                                 tell other people so they can have fun                                 with it but I've seen you have these                                 guns of matches against the lipsy to                                 make work with the feasting                                 ah you think this will become official                                 daily important future for example by                                 the next abilities well it gets more or                                 less perfect name it's an official for                                 office                                                             disability is about as we are put as you                                 know it from the little spots so that's                                 why I got the flag technology play to                                 you because yeah as I said fuse isn't                                 probably working at the moment some some                                 fuse packages work but all those who if                                 we lie on the command line utilities                                 don't there's still some issues with                                 some single packages on the server side                                 I think you have

            or something I guess yeah do you have                                 any automatic way of analyzing their                                 clocks or do you all look at it by hands                                 what I one for you do that I think it                                 would be helpful to an automatic support                                 for this I know that well there's                                 automatic testing then in one who cuts                                 loose pong there's a lot of that but                                 you're not sure if it and also for the                                 free bc i refuse the architecture but                                 here's the infrastructure fight                                 I'm not worth any automatically passing                                 the locks and suggesting that you may                                 update the quantum guess or so but                                 usually the building maintainer have to                                 sign the bill gloves and look through                                 the bed looks anyway and at least two

               something like that they only work in                                 fact the pod yes does it matter most                                 packaging antennas which are problems up                                 they just copy during good process most                                 up to date on all things there are                                 fossils there just copy it into it when                                 they are supposed to so you get the most                                 up-to-date automatically follow                                 architectures not just a
