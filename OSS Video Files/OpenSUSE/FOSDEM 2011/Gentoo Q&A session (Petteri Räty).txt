	                              so the idea was here that for the second                               ours Bailey people are coming to dinner                               our days you had ok but so will pretty                               good to be here did you get that                               restaurant reserved ok then not a call                               if you have any questions carry here we                               have a group of developers because they                               wanted to Peter collected for you to ask                               for anything and a slice eigen I be able                                to do that and then of course y'all                                spillover from the last talk at least                                from the developers we can continue the                                pox the two points raised the previous                                talk and then continue on those but                                let's first talk if anyone has anything                                unrelated or to the previous point if                                you wanna and now let me go back yet                                migration                                                             at first sunday of weeks and traffics in                                progress including the scene about fun                                working and at least to the fire                                crackling starting to migrate send more                                thing over lives in popular bar chain to                                go far to get and so hopefully that work                                will be the first time to finally get to                                the game vibration forums Chan to x                                  well there were seven bosses may need it                                to they were problems with the migration                                itself which in the beginning was bit                                slow and family right we'll work on that                                and a lot brian from french pick their                                prey me which is an american pie tins                                specialist did some work and you know to                                tip at the end which does the                                conversions the initial around for                                robots run we're actually i think i'll                                start of optimized you get it nice and                                slightly over                                         and I think that the last numbers were                                under two hours the point why it was                                that if you have long window conversion                                we can't get any security features down                                during that period but that's now                                another problem anymore so then we have                                simple tools PF so we asked to the                                toasters do the migration from cps                                boxing and the books that are associated                                cps that have to be my ready to give and                                hope some people walk around                                sketches right now and finally there was                                the question about the axis Venus                                control execute which left                                           light which prevent views and as far as                                I know Rupert Adam was working with I                                think it's very close it's not fish but                                I can an estimate for when the funny i                                which i think most people are hoping for                                it either soon that basically we even                                exact estimate we are probably going to                                go over soon history shows but yeah                                actually the only person that matter                                from ideality ghatampur person loses                                that I simply is what would be good if                                anyone else yes                                any questions and they are there in the                                website registration of the elements                                but the background                                most people                                sorry Meegan probably okay the theorem                                em both no one's in the step of all the

went through so many things                                before their time in interstate                                both my user point of view select a page                                recognized from now on one side you play                                now                                Roland Catalina class is that most of                                his own it's a pretty sure it's very                                variable but what has no problem because                                we                                 facts are the air security of a Florida                                 solution-oriented equation which is                                 quite cool are so surprised David he                                 said we have already in our equation                                 saved well from the looks are already                                 there so thick it's not the semester if                                 you go to the subtitle need for it were                                 software is the ex-boyfriend you yep so                                 my initial point of idiocy if you use it                                 on a token serve as Iran you go it can                                 be used again to have it over the                                 capsule at City Hall we I guess                                 physically a company problem yeah                                 exactly genuine generalize them I don't                                 you recall we did study but recall                                 someone shared a link to                                 now see some of us if you mention                                 preparing the state of                                 straight solution and they were clear                                 that the change above was one of the                                 most secure rod maybe do submitted s for                                 the few of the common failures and they                                 realize that Lana is fair trade I                                 don't know if you recall drink but i                                 know i read it was thinking we were able                                 to                                 so funky                                 special yeah it's myself but hopefully                                 others don't you read as much as                                 possible what i was saying yeah people                                 will people do run harder in production                                 so there's a lot of people around with                                 vested interest in keeping hearted going                                 so yeah yes that's one part or in that                                 you should tend to her we can't you                                 heart yeah next question some some of my                                 thoughts we want to grow gentle we want                                 to make more people contribute and and                                 yeah and know how gentle works but we                                 don't know how to do this we discussed                                 some points we know we have a rolling                                 releases system and so we are not in the                                 press the local press and what it is                                 what to watch and so what we can do else                                 and one of my idea where is ya to create                                 the new installer I know that's a void                                 okay please it's called our game no no                                 different one not the other graphical                                 install hunting language widget star                                 which which looks in that base with this                                 information of Brock and TP rooting for                                 so it's a yeah it takes the ride see                                 flex it is a make on a different tool to                                 select some youth flex of your liking or                                 something like set which which detects                                 how you want to use candy ok so we                                 prefer on this use flags and yeah                                 something like in simple in style for                                 the power user who knows what to select                                 parts to support the not so improved                                 user whose pre settings and I think                                 you've just triggered itÃµs time machine                                 because we already have                                 porque tu that stuff audience receives                                 faxes and so has already there and with                                 the sea flags I've seen lots of users /                                 around put it into the end I would say                                 it aloud big defaults most users                                 shouldn't play along with it because my                                 ex a five percent performance difference                                 found on the negative the cost of stuff                                 breaking or randomly doing unexpected                                 things is much greater than that in my                                 opinion not admire because it is                                 imagined changes only that you can move                                 your system to ash architecture but I                                 don't see other negative respect I guess                                 I guess you haven't seen the four lines                                 look like monsters and some users create                                 hype refer this little sexy flesh                                 people's try to come from almost                                 arrested optimizing is also ready and                                 not stupid                                 but is the biggest advantage of this a                                 strategy is if yeah this is a                                 distribution builds itself after lots of                                 hours of course and you have an actual                                 and then most optimized for your target                                 architecture system distribution yeah                                 which in can't any other deliver because                                 have you configured a difference between                                 default and optimized secret lies in                                 terms of performance I know it's been                                 different to compare benchmarks and                                 percentage is low hey but that's one of                                 our biggest advantages compared to other                                 this tool then you can optimize as                                 maximum as you want on your half we're                                 so we should yeah we should push this                                 feature to show the rest of the world                                 here our district bills itself optimized                                 to your target are here and yeah                                 one no one else can do this so young as                                 they're dead operationally in devil four                                 circles the people have been around long                                 usually present the opinion that see                                 flags it's not a central feature of                                 danger they're talking about our                                 obsession I think that the breakfast                                 total possession since modern relax a                                 lot friends into it if why should I                                 build gtk support if I don't actually                                 care so it makes no sense to to activate                                 every you slave of course and that once                                 we have everything improvement by using                                 best better you sweat I'm going crazy                                 win simply but my opinion I don't think                                 it's not every quarter to use every                                 possibility gently delivers its yeah                                 it's the only way to get the most                                 optimized system for you prefer I am                                 everywhere and that's the reason why i                                 use gentle because i can do it and so I                                 won't do it you can but you don't have                                 to and I think really confused because                                 there were all these benchmarks of                                 startup times and people start attacking                                 unit systems I thought wait we have                                 already arrived there like two years ago                                 get about                                                               are they doing                                 I compile it but I don't watch too in                                 compiling and kind of like the point of                                 our installers yeah I won't try                                 something your scream idea I don't think                                 it's a good approach for new users I                                 mean let's say i'm a new user and the                                 system does the first installed by                                 itself I know nothing you're next first                                 I think that happens I'm actually lost                                 yeah I mean I don't know how you are                                 right i know this pollen yes yes I mean                                 if your calendar to chime in the power                                 okay if you're reporting time you can                                 actually make this picture is all get                                 another screen that I does that then was                                 very helpful because you know it's the                                                                                                    system you're writing only okay so they                                 are your user and you skip how to create                                 your oxygen you skip what they states                                 freeze you sleep configuring your                                 services then an object comes along and                                 you have to run it's a update but you                                 don't have become anything there and                                 them and then you curse to do because it                                 was wrong but in reality if you have an                                 experience you can bring yourself and if                                 you think it's too much then maybe you                                 have to try something out you are right                                 I think so too but the question is how                                 can we get more users and where is the                                 negative aspect if you get more not so                                 experienced users we can have someone                                 has to support users and unfortunately                                 it's coming out you know if someone                                 doesn't understand what she's coming up                                 and back and did he say I don't whatever                                 the problem is you this but usually he                                 didn't follow the document probably you                                 know I understand I mean I know many                                 people say yes right V now I don't need                                 this estaba yes it's clear I mean I                                 kouzef is right that if you want more                                 users we have crumbs make it easier but                                 anything with at this point use                                 authenticity                                 yeah exactly that stuff I mean we don't                                 tie by the light users and we don't it's                                 not in our goal is to have really users                                 using custom objects well time for                                 different purposes it look at the least                                 effective to town with one thing is                                 being solar but I actually if you follow                                 the general Hammond even if                                 experienced leaders from rolla handbook                                 exactly you also get a working system                                 and still like i said i charged it was                                 afeared using the gentle apple matchup I                                 think what harder papi is also a lot of                                 getting new users or people who once                                 that

have three unread                                 news items the problem is that not all                                 developers are using the citizen to its

      actually mentions nice that you should                                 run fuel cleaner pro update mine Milo or                                 something like that and just used the

to                                 point to portraits again so it's not                                 preservatives so if something happens                                 until episode I know that a large broad                                 said well I don't have that wrong                                 perversion trophy please yeah yeah we                                 actually have something for this but                                 instead of mixed effective that was what                                 it would be things like Pearl doing                                 saying that will be does which is you                                 slack tide insulation directories I                                 actually think what role does is pretty                                 nice because why would I need n fightin                                 to six and five to seven and fighters                                 for you on an eye on you I don't like                                 that system the Whomper only get one                                 girl to rule them all probably all the                                 states can be so was until recently only                                                                                                       finest bracelet makes major version                                 because they are you come back                                 legacy applications I got stuck on an                                 older version and voltage needs                                         little wonder you couldn't install it                                 now the problem is how do you expose her                                 to users because for example on old                                 system i have a complete GCC versions                                 and five or six fighting burdens and                                 it's tough never gets cleaned up right                                 but do you see I understand yeah it's                                 just Larry point                                  being in the tree at all the each of you                                 use flags when the obsolete application                                 gets upgraded you can just dip to clean                                 all the subway I think I think there's                                 also a funny trap for users because they                                 upgrade VCC by accident you know like Oh                                 update update yeah and then they run

automatically some sort of                                 aggregation and if just everybody                                 promises that if something happens                                 interesting in his team then you going                                 he's going to write a blog entry bout it                                 now those are already                                 really if it's on homepage people                                 reading it is on board if we won't read                                 it yeah I I see the victory                                 I mean I get kids whatever that I could                                 love it when I was like something                                 different                                 can you explain our time fancy about the                                 creating of signals and the official                                 forestry regarding the options which is                                 filled up into cville compared to the                                 original sauce if you if you check with                                 configure you see lots of options but                                 only a percentage of this is usable in                                 legal s use flags and it's a process or                                 is it yeah the liking of the developer                                 of this package how this is I can do a                                 short summary and why policy it if you                                 need to do this dependencies that are                                 controllable then you need to make them                                 use flags after that I guess the main                                 change game but for example if you can                                 control thus this ego give you this nice                                 one little source file that that's                                 wonderful things and there's no downside                                 it's probably been able by evil and that                                 give the use back choice this                                 not complete because if you have a                                 function that enables gauchos                                 independent is still you can enable it                                 heartily do it because you have my hand                                 if isn't sure that it is already on the                                 user system let's say is a little                                 optionally so why should i abuse yeah                                 they simply need to remove this question                                 from the recruiting of course back in                                 before if they watched it so I am not                                 unhappy to that question does have other                                 answers that are required to move them                                 that's indefinitely one of the platforms                                 do either way I don't care how they                                 learn the information as long as they do                                 but yeah you can use do you need                                 bridges your undersea but yeah what it                                 was I'm Julie yeah it's quarter to seven                                 mm any last questions before all the                                 hungry people are also may be a great                                 ugly poverty is how they improve quickly                                 I think that being able to give to                                 Purdue it instead of a lot separated                                 dogs We Trust which are parts of policy                                 we thank him play every character why                                 the Contra Costa                                 I give then one thing a look when                                 because i was there suppose of                                 developing my arm                                 actually takes the sound waves then we                                 have reduced immunity from death manual                                 cover and boo I think                                 yeah there are but I the reason I think                                 I go to cities changing so him so you                                 some ego for that he broke the handle so                                 I I want an evil the rotor sonowal                                 policies is there because for example                                 and they had been a great dammit                                         there are fixable but most of them                                 what I mean also I know that there was                                 another something before that world and                                 that are taken where type of the lady                                 which means that my ridiculous will be                                 that we need over and this document has                                 nothing to say about place when actually                                 describe it but I never know if you                                 think it's okay it'll be great to see                                 some of its do it there there are two                                 points here problem main points is one                                 is that the one purpose of the quizzes                                 is to force you to know what all kinds                                 of documentation exists and the problem                                 the second one is that if you don't know                                 where to find things you should be                                 coming again video mentor we're trying                                 to cope with the there for four                                 years                                 well I'm trying to get some stuff it                                 into their medals escort determine that                                 even if you give up level                                                technical stuff it's still there Valley                                 for many other things and it was so                                 anything yet still like with cyberlink a                                 single                                 let me make a suggestion that's pretty                                 revolutionary one but how about we just                                 switch the evil quiz at the end quest                                 because the Bible Quiz is basically                                 asking a lot of stuff above organization                                 structure and the end quest is asking                                 many technical stuff now the end                                 question contains stuff that you                                 actually need to know when you start                                 actually working with evils well well as                                 the evil quiz contains stuff that you                                 learn while working with the people                                 meaning during the mentoring things yeah                                 I didn't sort the e circle background is                                 that it used to be a two-phase process                                 seen that you need that first to become                                 like familiar with the community then                                 contribute in the middle identity                                 anyways these days we just do the both                                 at once and yeah if we ever get the quiz                                 web app into it it's much easier to                                 category categorize the questions and                                 which it's small we may depending on                                 which probably as                                 then then the other things could use                                 more resources buddy so that's down                                 that's in the pipeline hopefully this                                 year those opposed will be ready the                                 question                                                           posted any rails applications before so                                 and yeah there's okay one guy why are                                 your wishes and sad your topic but i                                 think one of the main reasons that users                                 think that workday is because you don't                                 have any we are exposed to the public                                 many of us use our web gnomes                                 communicate sinus stuff to the users but                                 this actually not a good way seems like                                 quite a stupid way to communicate stuff                                 so you set up attitude or reviving the                                 better because really don't have the                                 time because it will be possible movie                                 system and fragile stuff good ask our                                 users right stop for assets and we can                                 feed a simple any reason and then                                 publish i think                                 better not the best thing is at least we                                 can show them that we are and Ethier and                                 where work with plenty of users who are                                 really beginning but not like developer                                 so we should take a madness of my men                                 this is that is of the same useless                                 need to be on it                                 we can use our work quite well back in                                 castle for people are doing we for                                 example may                                 summaries so those those items were                                 small enough for one person to handle                                 rear reliably and assembling all those                                 bits that's also quite easy when you                                 tripped into the monthly basis there was                                 basically no one doing any content                                 because those people that gives to the                                 content were kind of not interested                                 anymore the questions they don't know                                 that myself he has no interest if we                                 have something back archaeology yeah we                                 do a bit of an accident because it would                                 please play something nice I mean                                 imagine imagine imagine you go to some                                 event that is only like smuggle related                                 to to linux distributions but to open                                 source in any case and you have the                                 opportunity of giving a talk there would                                 be nice to just have some set of slides                                 and you can then adapters for your                                 personal needs and thankfully we are                                 those some stuff either                                 Spartacus ok
