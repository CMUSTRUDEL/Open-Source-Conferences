Title: Distribution collaboration manifesto (Stefano Zacchiroli, Ja
Publication date: 2011-02-07
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	The FOSS distribution communities work toward very similar goals: each distribution aims at providing a coherent set of (Free) softwares to their users.A good deal of work (and patches!) can be shared across distributions and in part already is. The more we collaborate, among us and with our (common!) upstreams, the more we can improve Free Software as a whole. Sometimes, however, social obstacles get in the way of collaboration: volunteers don't like each other or each other distro; they might also easily get "religious" about the everlasting question "which is the best distro out there?".Understanding why we should collaborate across distros is the first needed step in improving how we collaborate.

me in                               the back yeah i forgot to connect a                               microphone actually think it makes me                               see                               that is also concede vivian peoplesmart                               for you notice the Fedora guys in the                               front row is it any better oh yes so                                just a few comments because happened so                                they we started this task about this                                completely by chance outside in the end                                zone so the story that we has been an                                interesting website we've been announced                                the way to go is for open respect which                                is about collaborating across different                                face of the projects and we enjoy                                discussed a bit about that and realize                                that some of the stuff which is                                particularly interesting for                                distributions is not there in that kind                                of time investor and in particular we                                realized that the the actual need of                                collaborating among different                                distributions and for the goal of                                improving face or in general is                                something we should really explain not                                much to current developer of these                                solutions because of insulin told us                                it's pretty clear that the developers                                for trans solution every interested                                already we shall set it down for like a                                newbie to explain to them why it's                                useful to fabric actually to try to                                teach people about them so who take an                                idea of having a kind of other                                discussion care for them to clear                                thoughts from different institutions and                                initially videos to try to brainstorm a                                bit about our collaboration money                                festival TV in the meantime is doing                                this wonderful this meeting so                                it's time to actually try to think about                                how can we improve if de Pombal donald                                islands so technically is socially                                collaboration among distribution and                                hearing from you what you think we are                                missing you actually have a digital                                practical collaboration like the springs                                we just said more and more individuals                                so this was pending and just to add a                                little bit you know i think i think                                anything if you've looked at linux                                distributions over the past ten years                                you've sons you've seen a lot of                                infighting you've seen a lot of you know                                get the witnesses getting religious does                                a great way of putting and and i think                                if we take a step back and look at the                                bigger picture it's not about one in one                                particular distribution versus another                                distribution but it's really what can we                                all do together like to make the world a                                better place and I think we all take                                that view yes there's there's                                differences in the different                                distributions and that's a healthy thing                                that's a good thing that's see you know                                there's nothing wrong with the                                differences we should celebrate those                                differences at the same time there's I                                think we had a tremendous opportunity                                ahead of us to work together so that                                we're not constantly reinventing the                                wheel but we're not saying oh we're                                going to go on a rewrite this                                differently just because this other team                                did it a different way there's a place                                to embrace the differences and there's a                                place to work together                                better place so we started this                                conversation than I invited justices                                rare because I think it's important that                                we get lots of different perspective and                                i don't i don't think the three of us                                have all the answers up here okay i wish                                we could have had folks from some of the                                other linux distributions up here as                                well that's probably as much my fault in                                anything for not getting the right                                people here but again we wanted to start                                this discussion i didn't come with any                                anything prepared as our slides or                                bullet points other than just starting                                the conversation see what comes out of                                that then we can move forward from there                                I mean this is exactly something you                                know also qantas champion within                                habitable which is why i was very                                 supportive of the idea with its scent                                 and some other people to Red Cross                                 distro discussion about application                                 distillation and you know I've which                                 also been really good sound so glad that                                 we can make that happen I think I wanna                                 thought there what everything else is                                 it's a saving you know between across                                 desktop right what the often see is that                                 the                                 really that people actively want to work                                 that against each other now I mean                                 sometimes there are like these religious                                 feelings when it comes to existing                                 technology but when it comes to creating                                 something new naughty often see is that                                 solutions have very similar issues as in                                 the problems but then you simply also                                 try to solve them by themselves instead                                 of initially starting to talk together                                 so what's different I think right across                                 dissolution appstore thing is that                                 simply at some point well this doesn't                                 start about guys we need some kind of                                 reputation for something to you know                                 compete with technologies that we are                                 seeing on in our iphone and android now                                 these these marketplaces for                                 applications the sarin thought was oh                                 but we need to do it across distribution                                 and just adding that stuff already it                                 makes it happen I think that's not                                 really much more need that other than a                                 change of myself that as soon as you                                 start talking about thing we have                                 problem here let's try to solve it next                                 step should be and can we do that                                 together with other disabilities it                                 doesn't even mean it's bad to start                                 working on it already but you should at                                 least look around and see what other                                 solutions there already are and so it's                                 more something of okay ignoring                                 sounder then actively doing the wrong                                 thing I think it is more forgetting                                 about doing the right thing so I ever I                                 just a couple of questions to start                                 which I actually care about so I will                                 let you know from people how do they                                 feel about what are we missing you pull                                 up or any more among different solutions                                 based on some very stupid stuff like for                                 instance if didn't have that makes them                                 was in touch with people from individual                                 developers when we go people are the                                 brightest emotion probably we wouldn't                                 have known how to contact them even if                                 you have a mailing list like the                                 distribution freelance for mailing list                                 it's very rare to see their daily life                                 okay this who should i contact so my                                 first question as a subject for                                 discussion is what are we missing to                                 collaborate more across different                                 solutions and another one do you think                                 that something like writing a manifesto                                 in which distribution engage equal                                 operating more as a kind of                                 communication on the subject would be                                 useful or maybe not at all maybe we just                                 need people organizing meeting so stuff                                 so this is a couple of question and                                 purple what are we missing that way                                 better and whether we writing something                                 down be useful documentation on                                 just shout and we'll meet us there if                                 you like you said it's mostly about                                 finding each other finally what's out                                 there you don't know what is what's                                 going on inside another distribution so                                 I think there should be like where you                                 can with also context people least what                                 site where people are listens like this                                 this person is doing that resolution and                                 so on projects so some personal                                 description box the right okay just go                                 into that website to find out what is                                 already a visual know the distributions                                 what is comparable to this in some way                                 oh you're in a sec and trying to keep a                                 list of people so this is about them                                 yeah i was thinking we need is probably                                 not not very easy to maintain such a                                 sides because it will and it will                                 probably be easier if friends like we I                                 know that within debian we have an about                                 page us on our website which lists                                 several teams and things like that am I                                 probably easy to just have a central                                 site that gives orders to websites in                                 other distributions like such an about                                 page or something else you did it to                                 Switzerland so that if you say okay I                                 need to find someone with in say Susan I                                 can go to that site and see okay which                                 side would I go to define is information                                 because if you tried to centralize that                                 on a central vision you're actually                                 duplicating formation which nautica I                                 think I bet you                                 ninety percent of the mutants Don you                                 and a half that themselves oh ok it's                                 certainly data the changes over time                                 it's hard to maintain but let me just                                 throw out there that is a project leader                                 if you have a question on who's the                                 right person you thought contacted we're                                 I feel free to drop me an email and i'll                                 try to wrap that do the proper direction                                 which may also be honest a few times                                 with solo album always going to get that                                 but we need to the islands by people                                 that call that phone is this version                                 right now have a point person from each                                 district ambassador I think the car I                                 think that if our am not sterile we free                                 there are supposed to be playing and you                                 know we got the moving absolutely so                                 this is definitely one way you know if                                 you're looking for someone then                                 definitely you know with the no pursuit                                 contact me then Doris etc and but it's                                 also I think we need also more well who                                 are pushing me one of the things that                                 you mentioned sweet you we might have                                 liked                                 a website or a manifesto I am Not sure                                 that the manifesto itself is you know                                 that useful but it does create some                                 attention to the issue and I think it's                                 very much what we need is a change of                                 mindset right i mean the way of                                 contacting a specific personal                                 dissolution it's not that difficult                                 right i mean if you put in some effort                                 there you will find the right person I                                 don't think it's that hard and it                                 reasonably obvious actually to contact                                 me or territory stephana but it's much                                 the problem I think is that must be done                                 even things started in the first place                                 and that is probably something the                                 manifesto I'm good nor but also this                                 discussion has a function that of course                                 be clear in this room suddenly might                                 think about this next time they see                                 problem and what they will find a                                 solution for that it's a coin from there                                 I think I mean there is a simple set for                                 this I mean you guys are the one                                 posed to know everything someone's on                                 without me there sorry just a few                                 together move every three months well                                 it's I mean not to me because I mean we                                 have just representing the most visible                                 distribution so that there are tons of                                 that so we I think if you want to find a                                 solution or something should be a                                 solution which force for me most now the                                 highest number mr. Bhushan possible so                                 we shouldn't find a general solution                                 which you can say okay we think it's                                 good one contact people walk up the                                 person one cotton email address which                                 institution and there is where we                                 started because for instance in the                                 beginning of the distribution is not                                 register we did some work in actually I                                 think indexing distribution and trying                                 to matter where our patches of each                                 distribution of the specters frame this                                 kind of stuff but actually makes that                                 very simple point we missed a single                                 email address which gives you know                                 which respond domain postage the right                                 by someone and the single individual                                 which you apply so it's not just about                                 getting the trigger bus together or the                                                                                                         it's be even easier it's all the                                 representatives from the distribution                                 all gather on the same mailing list then                                 you just have to drop her maid who works                                 on this kind of subject and default can                                 can react i think that a fairly good                                 idea i would hope that the existing                                 distributions list would be the right                                 place to do that if at sea i'll be                                 honest i didn't subscribe to the                                 distributions worse since i became the                                 thrower project later I haven't seen                                 nearly enough discussion on that list as                                 I would as I would like this here video                                 yeah um I'm her since I all of that                                 stuff is really good sinful ish three of                                 you and                                 years or leaders of other various                                 community distributions choose who are                                 able to each other is all really good                                 but the suggestion I would make all of                                 you just made a really you know key                                 point here is that this is really about                                 changing the attitudes and behaviors of                                 the individual developers with you the                                 different distribution communities it is                                 so easy if you step back from so take to                                 vivid do things that to mostly see the                                 sort of arguments and bickering between                                 the different distributions with my soon                                 the sort of individual package or                                 subsystem level people do work with each                                 other and they do enjoy working with                                 each other and so I would think that                                 probably the most useful thing that the                                 three of you could do and that your                                 peers and the other food any                                 distributions to do is just to keep                                 talking about this within your own                                 distribution context now let's make sure                                 the w in context if it shows up and in                                 some of the updates that you products                                 the phone now let's get into the weekly                                 new does it say the same thing with                                 other distributions internal                                 communications mechanism and just keep                                 hammering on this notion that if you                                 don't know the people who do the same                                 kind of work that you do we have the                                 distributions around here you're not                                 absolutely grieve that I think actually                                 this is very much something you know I                                 mean it's a change of culture we need to                                 start thinking about this on an                                 individual developer level that means                                 not just as you need to talk about it                                 but it's also something everyone the                                 month each other need to talk about                                 right if someone sees a problem and                                 wants to work on the solution that                                 others should shoot suggest to look up a                                 look outside to see if other communities                                 have the same trouble who want to work                                 together so it's also something everyone                                 here little                                 the developer out there have some                                 responsibility here and if I get to that                                 one point of that it's not just about                                 the packaging there's several other                                 places where we could cooperate better                                 whether its documentation whether its                                 translation whether it's heaven heaven                                 forbid i say marketing you know there's                                 lots of other ways where we duplicate                                 effort and we could we could certainly                                 you know communicate long enough it's so                                 i just want to ask everybody here if                                 upcoming to pause them yesterday who                                 knew about the distributions making me                                 some credit stuff inside that's not                                 enough less than half of the people and                                 would you that we have cross distro wiki                                 on free disturbed transversus that's                                 what we need it i think the guiding                                 hands events going to go and you know                                 make mojito cheap are saying bring knows                                 people from other distributions that do                                 the same work that they do which is also                                 music                                 ultimately so the plenty of plenty of                                 opportunities ahead of us here to work                                 together in a more concerted fashion                                 it's probably a little bit for article                                 but I actually don't think that putting                                 lots of emphasis on things like knowing                                 that amusing conditions mailing list is                                 actually such a big man it's good that                                 those things exist it's good that the                                 places like that the pond and make                                 connections between the different                                 communities but I would be disappointed                                 if most of the collaboration most of the                                 actual interaction work doesn't happen                                 in a much more direct much lower lobe                                 sure sure I agree with that but at the                                 same time we've got this resource out                                 there that we can use that we're not                                 using at all to even start you know                                 start conversations even if it's a                                 better at the macro level or not of the                                 micro level yeah I think definitely at                                 the mark micro level a lot of stuff is                                 already happening right i mean other                                 than i think a lot of packages work with                                 their plates already and their offensive                                 being shared and innovative stuff so                                 that that is working but especially when                                 it comes to you don't know who your                                 favorite and due to contact ecuador                                 placed across this which emailing                                 national bacon fresh start so I think                                 it's yeah that's defecates you special                                 so come on down there and that's                                 insanely that may be looking at this                                 thing very very positive way can't find                                 Artemis the biggest contact service in                                 all                                 I'm see how again we use the fittest lot                                 of work for maybe it will also be                                 interesting to look at what what cannot                                 be what cannot be made or cannot be                                 reused by possible whole idea of                                 employing distribution joining work when                                 you can work and trying to shed some                                 light into the things that really are                                 different for distributions and trying                                 to you know like kind of defeat got a                                 fire in the hole in my ear distribution                                 does this better and distribution of                                 this better than just kind of like one                                 what is actually different and why it                                 must remain indifferent in some aspects                                 what is it that makes those dissolutions                                 in some specific sort of work unique in                                 this sense and why he must remain so                                 instead of trying to didn't but all                                 those kind of jam things together and                                 try to make it work together                                 maybe does making sense then actually be                                 doing that for Debian in the talk after                                 this one but but yes absolutely so I                                 think part of the president but Vincent                                 was referring to install Peter didn't                                 get the point of the grocery store                                 meeting actually lot of people like to                                 think about universal packaging system                                 or like unifying all this train a single                                 district that's not the point of the                                 diversity is devotion it's actually very                                 good I think so the point is that it's                                 difficult to keep a balance between the                                 difference which should exist the                                 healthy difference we should exist                                 within the solutions and avoiding                                 duplication of work so yes compete every                                 patron is with me a single distribution                                 level partially you know promote their                                 own feature of their own values because                                 I don't think we should get together and                                 decide what engine is with the agile                                 pretorius without any it's something you                                 know it's part of the marketing of every                                 single mr. bush to do that is to palawan                                 Stefano's pointer I think he each                                 distribution has therefore for preferred                                 packaging format I think they have their                                 own goals and ideals and principles that                                 they stand on which don't always align                                 one hundred percent and my my goal with                                 this you know starting this conversation                                 is not to say we're all guys have the                                 same goals and we're going to all have                                 the same ideals we all have the same                                 packaging format but but to to respect                                 that there are those differences in that                                 that's healthy and that's okay and we                                 all focus on the things that are most                                 important to our particular project but                                 do we really have to duplicate effort                                 you know yeah a lot of things were where                                 there's no reason to duplicate the                                 effort things like like I said                                 documentation translation those sorts of                                 things                                 a lot of times we're toward we're                                 reinventing the wheel solely for the                                 sake of reinventing the wheel just                                 because somebody else did it somewhere                                 else and in a different community but                                 this keeps coming back to this theme of                                 optimization and leaving all of                                 duplications of it and that's not what                                 collaborations about collaboration is                                 not really about I mean it's not about                                 optimizing all the efforts that you doin                                 to notification at all anymore                                 congregations about just doing stuff                                 together that is fun and I mean the                                 cross destroy Adam Scott a meeting was                                 just this great cause all the guys we're                                 sitting there and have fun together and                                 came up with some results and it's we                                 are keep talking about optimization of                                 our resources which is not what we                                 we'll cross this through or collaborate                                 with other thing but well I think that                                 are different reasons for collaborating                                 cuz this show and you're also not                                 necessary the same as mine and this is                                 true in general but that's not forgettin                                 optimizing here is not optimizing in an                                 industrial sense it's rather than most                                 this time for sure most communities                                 communities associated to disturb a few                                 minutes of volunteers so if you reduce                                 the duplication of that one people will                                 align more time to have fun on different                                 products I'm not but maybe you don't                                 care but for the sustainability of the                                 dividual communities that is really                                 important so if you can always use one                                 side by other you might reach out better                                 results and having photos on your phone                                 so and then let me point out that yeah                                 elimination of duplication and that sort                                 of thing is is the first step towards                                 collaboration it's not the end goal but                                 it's it's it's a will hanging through so                                 to speak it's the easiest way to get                                 started building relationships of trust                                 between the different distributions and                                 once that trust is there it's easier to                                 put on their forward-looking projects                                 together in it                                 I think we've got one in the middle is                                 Quebec yes wedding but my point is                                 finding out maybe my first                                 for work would be interested in my                                 collectible                                 fun on your feet                                 projects various collaborations what                                 would be interesting to see how looking                                 forward having a collaboration between                                 the leaders of various projects to                                 identify the common weaknesses where                                 linux of the home suffers in one of                                 those points of marketing and where we                                 might be able to push forward against                                 competitors by having a common theme                                 where we might be able to common work                                 and make ourselves you mean that's a                                 great point big weekend one Billy                                 barback thank you I think                                 what does it mean today Indians ago but                                 now they're                                 welcome                                 a later on                                 maybe once you have a definition and                                 jiggle                                 k I think at the beginning with                                 those off be popular on                                 right and I think some of the least play                                 on the distribution that I'm most                                 familiar with fedora we've gone through                                 that over the past couple years we've                                 done some soul-searching and F                                 themselves who are we why are we here                                 what are we doing what are our goals and                                 certainly put our board over the past                                 several months is has worked very hard                                 to come up with a vision statement a                                 mission statement that a target audience                                 those you know and goals for us I know                                 the opensuse a project is it has done                                 some of that that same thing and I think                                 all distributions from time to time stop                                 and ask themselves what where r goes why                                 why do we exist what sets us apart I                                 think that certainly happened within the                                 different different distributions I                                 don't know what that's happened on a                                 more macro scale than that home yeah I                                 think basically it is a balance for the                                 softball question but something that's                                 funny I mean yeah it's a completely                                 relevant from across different                                 discussion I mean I got to go back to                                 the earlier point where basically guy                                 off their said you know we need to look                                 at what makes Linux competitive to walk                                 compared to other platforms and that is                                 still very strong degree having superior                                 technology I mean marketing basic                                 older as well and bar collaborate we can                                 simply make Leonard stronger because you                                 know duplicating work means that you                                 know both products are using that's good                                 I mean there's there's a dance concerts                                 to doing the same thing in two different                                 ways you know there's some kind of                                 Darkness or going on a fix offer and you                                 know we want to keep that but as soon as                                 you figure out that something now is                                 really good this is a good solution I                                 think it's something good if differently                                 solutions adopt it and work together on                                 that and okay to some degree you know it                                 is fun to create something fresh and new                                 me again but at some times you know you                                 also have to look at the big picture and                                 you know it is more fun if we have say                                 hundred million users for linux in the                                 world then if we have five hundreds then                                 excuses in the world so frankly a little                                 more ambition is something you know i'd                                 like to see and I think that it's                                 relevant for days as well if we want                                 lettuce to succeed we have to work                                 together you know to make it gets better                                 overall for everyone what over here and                                 I think that we're just about out of                                 time yeah let's go our best one so                                 basically                                 i wish i had wood                                 proposing clearly about developers or is                                 it also about and bringing the user                                 I'm thinking of you know finding ways of                                 leveraging bug report from                                 like we have the app's rating the                                 comments and the rating                                 how you want to are you seeing users and                                 yellow lab in my experience and I saw                                 them excited confirmo super back in                                 service users and to beat a bit more                                 religious while distribution then                                 developers yeah so at least I see that                                 as a way more difficult and at the                                 moment I see less value that then but                                 let's say that we started development                                 lab then we see where work it done and I                                 think we need to be very careful with                                 our choice of words here again I'm with                                 developers I would replace that with                                 contribute yes because it's not just                                 people developing code it's it's it's                                 the kind of the edge of services that go                                 along with that whether I get                                 documentation marketing packaging                                 translation design those sorts of things                                 people who are contributing however                                 however best fits in their own needs all                                 this                                 one thing that a lot of packages are                                 playing about is the fact reaction that                                 happens so I wonder if there's anything                                 there certainly opportunities to improve                                 the way the way things are going I don't                                 think we have time left here to any on                                 the exactly the implementations down the                                 pike and we all recognize that there's                                 there's ways we can work together to                                 make the experience better for                                 everything so I think we should clear I                                 try to post up some minutes to the                                 distribution mailing list and so we                                 might have to subscribe to get enhanced                                 one last question I'll make it short                                 like a sensation is mostly but by                                 pooling our content in our knowledge and                                 our expertise are we setting those                                 iphoto we risking those as a gigantic                                 free lunch for butcher I'm not sure I                                 get the question by sharing things to                                 expose ourselves to risk the free world                                 three letters well friendly speaking if                                 it improves free software in general I                                 don't care I mean as long as it improves                                 with a functional the shank is good                                 if your other benefits from that well                                 okay I I tonight I I don't see it is us                                 versus are going to I'll be training                                 I'll say pal say it like i like i see it                                 thank you know I'm gonna have seen                                 proposals from a bum to have greater                                 coordination between software projects                                 has been rejected by the distributions                                 those reasons for that ok well there's i                                 wouldn't i would say rejected i think                                 that's that's probably a stronger and i                                 think we we saw the proposal was made                                 and parts of it that we're really good                                 there were parts of it that we could fly                                 agree with and so we started the                                 conversation Wolcott if it was something                                 we were you know we could we could agree                                 muscleman it looks like and that's what                                 started this conversation i think this                                 is just the beginning of the                                 conversation though i don't think we can                                 rule far enough down the road to be able                                 to save ya this is this is what we want                                 to understand for this is how it's                                 different it's the beginning of a                                 conversation i'm a sudden as well thank                                 you thank you everybody for this                                 you
