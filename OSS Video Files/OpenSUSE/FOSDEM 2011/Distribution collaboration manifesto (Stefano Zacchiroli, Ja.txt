Title: Distribution collaboration manifesto (Stefano Zacchiroli, Ja

Description: 
	The FOSS distribution communities work toward very similar goals: each distribution aims at providing a coherent set of (Free) softwares to their users.A good deal of work (and patches!) can be shared across distributions and in part already is. The more we collaborate, among us and with our (common!) upstreams, the more we can improve Free Software as a whole. Sometimes, however, social obstacles get in the way of collaboration: volunteers don't like each other or each other distro; they might also easily get "religious" about the everlasting question "which is the best distro out there?".Understanding why we should collaborate across distros is the first needed step in improving how we collaborate.
