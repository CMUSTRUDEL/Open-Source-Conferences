Title: Mancoosi tools for the analysis and quality assurance of FOS
Publication date: 2011-02-11
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	we will present a set of tools for the analysis and quality assurance of FOSS distributions.These tools analyse meta-data of packages (like dependencies, build-dependencies, conflicts, etc), and answer questions like:which packages are installable and which are not?for which packages is it possible to install a build environment?which packages are absolutely mandatory for the installation of a package (which might have dependencies with alternatives, or on virtual packages)?which packages will certainly become uninstallable when I upgrade a certain package? These tools have been developed by the Mancoosi project, continuing the work started during its predecessor project EDOS. This will also include a demo of the new "Weather Service" for distributions.
