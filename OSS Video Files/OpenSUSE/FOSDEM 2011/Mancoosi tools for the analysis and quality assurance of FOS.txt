Title: Mancoosi tools for the analysis and quality assurance of FOS
Publication date: 2011-02-11
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	we will present a set of tools for the analysis and quality assurance of FOSS distributions.These tools analyse meta-data of packages (like dependencies, build-dependencies, conflicts, etc), and answer questions like:which packages are installable and which are not?for which packages is it possible to install a build environment?which packages are absolutely mandatory for the installation of a package (which might have dependencies with alternatives, or on virtual packages)?which packages will certainly become uninstallable when I upgrade a certain package? These tools have been developed by the Mancoosi project, continuing the work started during its predecessor project EDOS. This will also include a demo of the new "Weather Service" for distributions.

thing which is he knows maybe of                                that project so this was a previous as a                                project of Russia fortune and what I'm                                talking about here is focus on the use                                for chicken put your continuing now in                                the project so in both for                                             partners are working on different things                                one particular point we have been                                working on and I'm interested in is the                                analysis of metadata of packages so what                                does that mean so well as I thought your                                aunt Edie and develop our and then all                                was thinking about TV on or about the                                same thing is to say as a competent                                based models an awesome lungs The                                Situation's so what you have is your                                components in genuine equinox your                                packages which is in essence of a                                component and thus these packages you                                have eight architectural relationships                                which are expressed we're in here works                                ni square spoil the fantasies conflicts                                and revised in other package models and                                common honest you have similar things                                we're almost in all common pulsates                                which calls for                                                    kinds of relations between                                and this is the call of the relations                                that you can have between pages you                                might have more but what you have for                                this comes in second landing and what                                we're doing in the project is when it                                tried to be internet for a particular                                package model or I'll be concentrate on                                this form of Ortiz is a mighty court in                                a particular model and the other                                properties which might also be present                                and come in and at it at the second                                level morning okay so we look at a                                kitchens and the only look at me the                                data of course it's much much one guy                                agents and there's much one with the                                analysis and quality assurance or                                packages or other we have to start with                                some place and we started at the place                                we saw that you could come to do                                something useful and see the video of                                the packages and what we are doing is                                here too in your clothes and that's very                                important so what is a big event of many                                generations all the other packages that                                are found the present in the situation                                so we're doing your analysis and you are                                trying to look at a completely solution                                and that wine to look at a question how                                these packages with a to each other in                                the complete of the persecution for                                instance when you are trying to answer                                the question it's the me confirmation of                                the package is it for him inside of a                                Disick you shun then you're looking at a                                complete chain of dependencies Thank You                                market                                was all dissipation are you foresee                                dependency chains this would be                                accomplice to other properties of                                metadata which is not true so an example                                of a pet or poverty which is not normal                                is for instance when you look at your                                page at the meter data and you just look                                at those are all your negligence which I                                mentioned in this package our person is                                as I already went this is the case so                                this will be just the low clearances                                you're going masters of this and why are                                we doing that why it's important for                                 foster solutions we have such a global                                 analysis of the relations between pages                                 well it's two instances i think but this                                 is the first one is Fang up in store so                                 then you have can swallow like act or                                 you are here you are it was the same                                 form of year                                 okay installer of this time then what                                 you have to do if you have to if you                                 have a request to change its a nation                                 seconds of your analysis acuteness you                                 have to solve some constraints so you                                 have to do what people they can see                                 sorry and for that of course you have to                                 look at you who offered execution which                                 is currently available on your machine                                 so you have to do a clove solving of                                 constraints in order to answer to                                 village in which packages to anything                                 soil again so all up wake in order to                                 satisfy it it's a request this is one of                                 the tasks of package managers it's not                                 the only one but it's a future trance of                                 package managers and in fact this is a                                 particular Singhvi account with working                                 on enable puja project so it's of the                                 only one of the two main color points                                 that you come to technical kuzey project                                 Oh Emma I won't talk much about this I                                 just have one slide this is gonna put                                 some things that I would like to work                                 with over the day and I don't want talk                                 about the second point and this is                                 something which is going on since much                                 longer this is appointed juice so in                                 quality issuance in China China Travis                                 you were asking the cipher and you look                                 at all the texts at your execution and                                 you try to assess the quality of your                                 packages inside this devotion and you                                 would like them Allah says they are any                                 good shape this is a are any future                                 which is sufficient to be released so                                 this is the way to mismanagement of as I                                 said khaya                                 operates and modifies it what in from                                 the sea and again this for this fog it's                                 only about student in ships or other                                 images of this about me for the                                 intelligence when dependencies fun                                 things provides and so on in fact this                                 is about that you saw the evil fortune                                 be imported so do god I'm presenting                                 here something we started in                                           and which are your carry-on super booty                                 project for a moment okay but before                                 talking about foods about qualifications                                 to top this off I would just put on one                                 sniper pounds and okay it's okay before                                 before I talk about their package                                 managers thing I want is for me to say                                 when i go to why this is important for                                 us as if you geez but we are yes i miss                                 you i the university and the question is                                 also why is this important for                                 scientists find a science electricity                                 looking at its legends and developing                                 foods in order to answer these questions                                 well there are two saints the first one                                 is continent I suffrage in you is what                                 stopping in its of engineering and the                                 other words people working on these                                 common base models and how cover the                                 base models can be configured it can be                                 managed this has helped our exes on the                                 level of knowledge distributions it also                                 exists on difference in                                 telecommunications the pockets of                                 changing components of a money system                                 analysis which is a completely different                                 set whatever this is                                 important thing and a lot of people who                                 enters in this comedy bits of                                 engineering stuff and for the situations                                 are where it as far as i know very odd                                 as far as i know the other doctors                                 existing content based systems yep ebru                                 everyone for                                                           packages and this will not be Betty and                                 thirty suppose because ten different                                 architectures and it's very very rapidly                                 evolving so this is a very important                                 component based system and of course if                                 you interested in this often this is                                 puppy you can cook it and that's a                                 reason what if you can okay it's this                                 they can because it's open and                                 everything is available to be                                          for everybody at the source for                                 everything available to data available                                 for everybody you have tools resources                                 and everybody can go get it and use it                                 for some a second thing is and that's                                 what we're interested in is from the                                 Tommy importance on now this would be                                 now the scientific input which goes into                                 the tools that i'm going to present to                                 you today so what does this mean so this                                 means that you are tapering difficult                                 coconut oil province the different                                 techniques which have been developed us                                 on this over                                 the case where one secure feel when you                                 plan to analyze the program from humans                                 of a distribution are very very                                 challenging challenging problems they're                                 very very difficult office and if you                                 have evolved education presents so the                                 river floods from NP complete but just                                 means it's not very challenging and it                                 means in the worst case only the                                 birthdays it's so difficult if you get                                 the cognate Orion explosion so you                                 cannot take on it in a glass case                                 luckily it's often the case and for this                                 kind of Hawkins and cases which which we                                 need employment package you can take its                                 them then you put in some intelligence                                 or when putting their billing into                                 general tools okay and why is this                                 problem difficult well it's difficult in                                 class relations between images which are                                 not just simple needs but say are                                 looking for a solution formulas because                                 what you learn today for junctions                                 because you can combine several                                          make it shiny head on a and on me and                                 don't see send us junctions if                                 alternatives this might be persons these                                 are explicitly or implicitly explicitly                                 when you can wire it directly in bogota                                 agencies like the circuit since anyone                                 oh it might be in pacifica case there                                 you have a tendency on certain package                                 and you have several versions of the                                 package of variables on your choice of                                 picking one subversions to chop away and                                 it's so far it's like significant is the                                 fact that you also the functions it is                                 negations and this is of course to me                                 while hope it becomes interesting for                                 scientists and for people working on the                                 droid I'm sorry ok now the size                                 I was talking about down the bottom                                 billion package managers so we also                                 dance the view on peg advantages and the                                 way all good package managers should be                                 filled and we think that one of the                                 problems you're currently facing is that                                 there are many many different component                                 models and packaged ones who are looking                                 for good take each package into a                                 package managing to is so if he wants to                                 find foot solutions and for solving                                 dependencies we have to find the balance                                 in soils for very many different                                 components models which are slightly                                 different but often quite similar in                                 nature on the other hand there are many                                 promising solving techniques which are                                 go on and which can be employed in order                                 to solve this kind of problems so what                                 we think is what's needed is a modern                                 architecture to solve this handle stuff                                 and Bobby fok is in fact an approach                                 where you have very have one common                                 interface language between only one and                                 the packaging model and the other lens                                 disorder and you pretended Travis                                 performance the form is called CBF I                                 won't go into details of that because                                 you thought about this if you are                                 married or in person or that one fewer                                 funny part is already several times some                                 cases of the bottle several times I just                                 want to say we have this reform I can                                 see boxing is a model approach which is                                 this serious form it as a centerpiece                                 and last thing is if you are developing                                 a dependency soil or if you are given                                 the package financial and if you haven't                                 heard                                 application yet octopus yeah set up an                                 international competition of dependence                                 absorbers the input weapons which is                                 first in PDF format and which have to be                                 solved by the different solvents who are                                 anticipated participating in this                                 competition gets the first one of that                                 in Edinburgh in July last year the next                                 one will begin to temper and so if you                                 aren't developing policies things please                                 talk to us and give it a bit more                                 details about yeah ok so now are more                                 exactly departments the coherence                                 programs that here ok so this is a very                                 very basic problem that responsible on                                 in                                                                      it's just you are given the positive is                                 it a packages and you wish you know is                                 it possible to install a hidden package                                 often suppository just Alan please me                                 and more formally your mathematicians                                 work in nature so you like to write it                                 down the informant and asthmatic                                 advantage but this is the only slide                                 region where you will see many examples                                 focus here so for the popular support me                                 positively isn't ventures and one peg                                 each focus on positive and eventually                                 that you ask is an insulation be cooking                                 insulation which is permitted by the                                 suppository and which prevents the                                 package they put me the detective can be                                 installed so the dependencies can fizzle                                 so medically this means is set assassin                                 of the packages all right such it is it                                 does the job so it contains the package                                 help you are sequins on it is so it is                                 all                                 speaking to do not occur inside this                                 says I after the good night so it means                                 at my direction which does not conflict                                 with other packages inside the selection                                 and finally the effluence abundance it                                 is all the dependencies if to be                                 satisfied inside this city it is such as                                 it exists so he enemies anymore did I                                 catch any in store I a measly which is a                                 completely artificial setting since it                                 does not take into account what you mean                                 machine for you already hit and so some                                 other packages it should be older coming                                 from Elsa and which you want also to put                                 serve on your institution but this is                                 about basic with stupid one with a                                 scout's ok and put in seafood which it                                 sits in steep on earth it's going good                                 thing a Texas at a time for getting for                                 me and for the RPM for me and it's very                                 very iffy it's using one of the existing                                 solving techniques which has fixes I'm                                 coming at all your rock and soil which                                 is that solving technical technology                                 it's very fast so its audacity analysis                                 on completely realistic you in some ten                                 seconds equations are coping technique                                 and it also uses a caching technique                                 which is quite important because it's if                                 you ask this version for many packages                                 in a complicated situation then you can                                 take advantage of the fact if you have                                 for making salsa question for other                                 pages and result of this is that answer                                 this question                                                            question for all of the circuits also                                 packages are so many negative difference                                 in executed                                 okay so i can give you a demo of this so                                 this is hidden step change and Posadas i                                 will run it on our squeeze squeeze it                                 solution and you can see better reason                                 for parking but we do not so this is now                                 this basic situation which I thought of                                 it yesterday I hope it hasn't changed                                 much since yesterday or                                                it's a good season                                 so                                 the                                 okay well it's a little bit okay so it's                                 a little bit slower but socially token                                 packages see more unity so kudos to do                                 you see all packages entries on internet                                                                                                        is very nice thanks for this okay well                                 our simulator so first of all let me                                 then show you now                                                      now anoche which does not change the                                 nature of the deaths of the check                                 forever it means that it also shows the                                 cases the failure happens it is of                                 course because the failures                                 yep okay and you can see now that on                                                                                                          packages which cannot be installed so                                 this is Betsy well it's a good excuse                                 there's a good reason for that and the                                 reason is you see the new accreditations                                 which cannot install it because all                                 sinned have architecture and this is                                 expected so the way how the DVR                                 distribute is filled it's the following                                 getting a package which either compiled                                 for every and each architecture or which                                 exists the same Pacific the same on                                 every architecture the martha jackson                                 specifically target i see the patience                                 which one equals the transfers or                                 documentation awesome stuff it is not                                 specific to certain the solution now if                                 such a senior wife solution so its foot                                 while it's put into all architectures                                 and it's also put into an architecture                                 if it depends on another wreckage which                                 is specific to an architecture and it's                                 michael exists on certain architecture                                 so to the pin society which comes just                                 in by the very sexy and architecture                                 diamond and architecture independent                                 take ages so geosynthetics is also nine                                 the war's MIT say are it's oliver kahn                                 other architectures adjustment                                 controllable what is architecture so is                                 so bad okay so someone asks for once                                 they can go to                                 what is on fancy big agencies and sit                                 okay someone just continue with society                                 so using this one for different things                                 and one fitting since I applied early                                 it's fluffy vauxhall zillion better so                                 Vivian Bethel is a service which is one                                 on one of our go check my machines today                                 which is very good under the needles for                                 TD on both net so you can see they once                                 of this tool on the complete area of the                                 situation for all the architecture                                 proceeds for testing and for sale-                                 answer gauges ok that's the answer                                     packages found they got installed on                                 this is something which in fact he was                                 quite rapidly and this is something that                                 I'm sure you want to under the second so                                 much who gets you is so they suck movie                                 of onions of the packages on                                 architectures you can see references                                 from one day fujiyama this is of course                                 very interesting because you can see the                                 packages which become onion solvable on                                 which encompass all right you have the                                 distinction between architecture and                                 architecture which is important for me I                                 just got your power you can see since                                 where the heck is in this other song                                 which is also important since in fact                                 onion solubility is something which                                 happens quite frequently and quite                                 frequently it's just something which                                 exits for a few days and goes away since                                 you might happen you package it depends                                 on something ways we we provide                                 and which just comes in a few days ago                                 so it's just                                 it's okay when this happens a justin and                                 transiently which happens when but often                                 and you also get an extension for the                                 under soybean and here is what you get                                 so this is so for the sixth institution                                 you can see here for each of the                                 architectures poder de the number of                                 packages which are not in follow the                                     effective date before the munsees they                                 are                                                                 there are                                                           tickets all you can see the differences                                 which are not very high this is not                                 typically a much higher than functional                                 difference in much of creation now we                                 have to freeze as you know as you might                                 know first it and this explains why not                                 so much it's going on how big is it I                                 think when the freeze when it becomes                                 unfrozen sent this will be much more                                 okay and now you can click on on these                                 novels saying                                                            bit of packages which are insoluble                                 since when and you see the Xfinity she                                 why saigon and so you want to get the                                 difference between two there is some                                 difference but it means vacation                                 packages have become insolvent                                 to check on an insulin and control and                                 so it's ruined some before okay so what                                 are we doing this dead were at the                                 beginning at the inside the system you                                 go five heavy air pockets is having its                                 nice apron and clicking on it and                                 showing it to everybody but in fact you                                 did not do so much reading this is take                                 and I said well this is quite obvious                                 that you took a look at it so just so                                 many negatives which I've gotten so                                 evidence you just out number two this is                                 all of these things what is quite later                                 on in fact since that one wrinkles                                 wasn't there is that I silence                                          about parts about packages which                                 are not installable forever i'm quite                                 conservative on this because there are                                 many many reasons why i think each may                                 be installed so I think it's only in                                 very very certain cases first of all I                                 only to offend a package is not                                 insolvent oh no it's all occurred on any                                 architecture second see yes I do in                                 human packages some sort of the Fourth                                 Circuit are typically in some ways and                                 better                                 I think that possibly slot advancing                                 muffins and size                                                      can

    of this is in distant engine plant for                                 embedded systems in fact i installed the                                 system you can use this for this tool to                                 assure its ability of a pack extreme                                 file is uploaded with your hands this is                                 of course quite ready and you probably                                 do not want to let this for everybody                                 for already on containers since it                                 requires access tool and there and that                                 you want in order to check the packages                                 and so on however and their young                                 incident another seeing that he didn't                                 exactly like this in                                                    is that they excel it is to the                                 dependencies so far majority parentheses                                 but also very classes which express the                                 dependencies on package to be compiles                                 not to be small but will be compiled                                 depends are the big magazines you also                                 have a big con face now what we did is                                 we extend the system to all these                                 relationships and the way to go is just                                 to beat Valley packages each translate                                 parentheses to more to no dependencies                                 and poor things to normal things as I                                 follow me and you get an analysis of the                                 dependencies in fact this is famous                                 later on it is very interesting because                                 we did not singapore this at all this                                 initiative project this is how we use by                                 the team which is maintaining your

                  seawater feelings were quite busy always                                 fine food packages to install on your                                 keychain shoot all packages which are                                 necessary to prepare a package and then                                 this is it fail then this then it's                                 faint but it's andy population tempo                                 support of course the package was put                                 back into a few and some time later it                                 was again consider to be ok now these                                 infrastructure is using this is tool in                                 order to be sure even before attempting                                 to install the combination environment                                 just to ensure that this can be done and                                 if who finds out that is impossible                                 since or something each feed for                                 populations of the vendors and it just                                 that's most try to open the neck                                 another thing I'm doing I'm doing                                 recently it's getting violent fits it's                                 also something which can be useful for                                 other distributions Lassie and this is                                 evolving see I would like to detect the                                 cases where I have two packages which                                 I'm fine we can be installed together                                 shooters evidences importance however                                 when i try to do so i get never and can                                 ever because both packages try to                                 install a vector file on the same                                 awesome otherwise that one package tries                                 to attract to find each other pillows to                                 different edge this adds quite often so                                 if you are maintaining an uncertain                                 future you probably have seen address of                                 this kind of any issue so i'm trying to                                 detect these cases by analysis of the                                 video distribution and hope with                                        will be on vh                                                           all the past names which are contained                                 in the edges and if things on last names                                 contained in packages to nazar packages                                 it's huge it's Alchemist is about                                     megabytes now looking at this file i can                                 compute the set of pairs of packages                                 which share at least one person this                                 gives me about Vivian zips                                 deviantid this gives me about                                           other packages each potentially in the                                 governor of hijacking of five which is                                 owned by a different package okay these                                 thousand a us it's still a lot to this                                 to find out because it is bottom so what                                 I do now is I take this is my volunteers                                 and I won ultimate and our cool it's                                 exactly what is the power option                                 packages can be installed together the                                 core to the dependency and public                                 relations it is a conflict the                                 recognitions into packages or maybe it's                                 a project which is just implied by some                                 dependency chain and conflicts between                                 other packages said say its top of them                                 and okay so after this filter as soon as                                 I want                                                                                                                                    would inject were justified in soils to

person I'm sorry I don't                                 understand how is it possible for one of                                 those                                                                    this is tuned to some of the intrinsic                                 features of opinion since well these are                                 you nonstick layer that's one package

                        topless resorts answer okay so in fact                                 I'm running out of time since autumn has                                 some things to talk about I just want to                                 say a lot about you who's a                                       whether we got which is coming upward                                 but suppose this week where we have we                                 we Vance the complete elimination of the                                 battery and of all the tools this many                                 new useful tools this many applications                                 and one of the scenes ritual this is the                                 new whether we bought which he ever come                                 of this it's something is yet it's also                                                                                                          early for this kind of thing so instead                                 of naughty text section XO an                                 explanation of the kind of failure that                                 you get you get a graphical explanation                                 in kind of failure and this would be                                 something that you would get so you get                                 this package like this one which has a                                 chain dependencies and what you can see                                 is that this package that's nice inside                                 of dependency in the count depository is                                 saying is so like this package this has                                 a dependency on this as a dependency on                                 gates and this has a dependency which is                                 you see and you will get a graphical                                 explanation of this client in case you                                 have a                                                            dependency on one MZ I get ok so                                 now it's much more which is to sleep

   idiot is sordid and I think this is                                 quite others it's not very good                                 you and the other points are industrial                                 research for these are qualities like                                 Idol or academic departments working on                                 popping sobbing part of seats and over                                 to the forties okay and no that's your                                 second part of the presentation                                 ok so I'm I'm young I'm edition that the                                 same university is out in the open so                                 within the project so I'm basically                                 going to continue on the same team so in                                 the in my pc project has also been                                 writing some tools which also work on                                 the quality assurance of association in                                 sits on basically going to presented the                                 general in this case since when you just                                 gets the method asia of a distribution                                 you look at the dependency perfect                                 reaches its effects it's not something                                 that's just know who when you look at a                                 dependency to package it can never it                                 can have an effect on other practical                                 for example dependency on another when                                 you install package she don't only look                                 at the packaging dependencies that                                 package itself is also the dependence of                                 dependencies etc etc so becomes article                                 for complex is well conflict between two                                 packages doesn't we need those two                                 Pekovic can be in so together with your                                 file for any into the list you could                                 also have complicated dependency change                                 which trace back to this conflict would                                 make other packages normal soon so no                                 things that depends at different                                 meanings and alternative dependence                                 which week you can stop either for one                                 package for another which is                                 the most single dependency from making                                 it just it all packaging alternative so                                 our ideals to sort of abstracts from                                 this no team gather the semantics behind                                 the sentence find out what's than                                 getting back to drink or you can see                                 what does it mean advance it benefit                                 needs if I today I used to be as well                                 for what to get back to this for for                                 conflicts as well complex difficult to                                 taxes are not installable together so                                 the first tip is strong dependencies                                 this is a special kind of detention you                                 are used to find out are there it woods                                 and packages in Arabic it is a                                 distribution or more important than                                 others give them these our packaging                                 everybody needs for example if you have                                 a vacation senior distribution it's not                                 very good so that that's important                                 action in order to measure this raping                                 and strong dependencies strong fancy is                                 that when whenever you install a you                                 always it's gonna be as well so it's                                 really every installation place so every                                 installation sets of a always includes                                 be                                 but this is something that you can check                                 the SAT solver with the tool and it                                 gives you a good approximation of a                                 reporter because of the package that is                                 strongly dependable by many other                                 packages office it's a very important                                 package its melody many packages needed                                 to be insulted we're actually you can                                 you can't install many veterans at all                                 if this package is broken so you should                                 approximation so for example yes if you                                 look at the distribution here so we have                                 the L found it depends this is just so                                 this is just a normal dependency tree                                 from venture to alpha becomes in Bravo                                 depends on either echo Foxtrot problem                                 charlie etc etc there's a conflict                                 between echo and Kamya                                 so if we get the strong dependency tree                                 here obviously alpha if you want this                                 from alpha you have black suits and                                 problems and it's a strong you can see                                 it's not possible to so alpha without                                 installing brown the other everybody                                 gets from alpha to echo a up doll                                 if you choose either one so this is not                                 a strong identity Bravo Charlie rest of                                 it is also for foxtrots and golf and                                 hotel it's Armstrong attention based you                                 can either choose go for hotel so it's                                 not absolutely necessary to install it                                 does that mean that if you have a bit

suddenly neither                                 Indian or India dash now assess exactly                                 what somewhere now that's the mission                                 that's a single problem is you get to                                 the eccentric you know so when you look                                 at the table of strong dependencies in                                 so this is a list of packages that have                                 the most certain dependencies in the end                                 at our mode the most strongly defended                                 the bomb in the deputy cervix its own                                 blog no enormous surprise clearly see                                 lipsy which is basically needed by eight                                 percent of the distribution GCC new GCC                                 one live as the diamonds one which i                                 think is a defensive depth conference                                 something that's important sadly it's                                 all important vibration but it's nice                                 that you can now stay this with numbers                                 actually in three and attentively say                                 okay these packages are important as                                 opposed to just say okay as if she did                                 should be fun I don't think in the third                                 column you can actually see the number                                 from direct dependency the number of                                 times that are actually mentioned in the                                 dependencies often on fantage shaky alex                                 ebay for example it's only mentioned                                 once in dependency somewhere but if it                                 breaks you'll break                                              packages oats you can't really find this                                 house when you just look anytime you                                 have to look at whole boards and                                 okay same thing with strong conflicts as                                 front office between two packaging needs                                 if you can't install them together at                                 all under any circumstances so if you                                 have a package that has a strong                                 conflict with many other packages that's                                 also not good because it means a                                 difference on that managing some of the                                 contents impressively distribution for                                 Miss Elizabeth what what is interesting                                 is follow that strong cough it's                                 actually have a root how show what this                                 means later on because it out that                                 houses to track my comments for example                                 you ever bottom see the Tritton                                 conflict-ridden Bravo and Charlie that's                                 not seeing itself not a problem but it                                 also means that alpha and Delta are not                                 installable together with an alpha you                                 cancel Bravo the applicants of Johnny so                                 you can't install alpha and Delta to get                                 articles you will always have the                                 conflict between and a branch on the                                 other hand echo and golf are all right                                 because you can install for golf you                                 cancel foxtrots it's an adjunctive                                 eternity and Franco in distance all                                 drown so and now you can see that there                                 is a strong complete with your health                                 and Delta but actually the roots of this                                 from conflict is the problem between                                 brown and Charlie                                 so every and every strong conflict in                                 that sense has a conflict being done so                                 if you give to package your not                                 assaulted the other there's always an                                 explicit conflict at the bottom which in                                 a certain way explains it for example I                                 guess it's been I hope this is visible                                 against VidCon solved right now birds                                 there used to be a package in the den in                                 distribution up till at least                                        think let's call people integral V it's                                 a package attest to thousands strong                                 conflict so if you thought process from                                 found out the package anymore it could                                 be so why is it a chemical you said we                                 found out that the root of this problem                                 was that there was a conflict between he                                 came to addy and                                                     very often in fact so end of this post a                                 lot of problems with Allah passion                                 because if you cancel this with five                                 hundred counts in solitude and in fact                                 is it depends on financial office is it                                 steps proposal from so what we saw the                                 next day it's actually a deacon to be as                                 a conflict with Python in a diversion                                 greater than                                     so this is super uber between against                                 this in the Debian packages will turn                                 out that this we have already found                                 nobody took the bounties looked at it                                 for three years because of its                                 importance so at least now we contain                                 this is important this it really                                 participation okay so this is this is                                 two more examples of the things that you                                 can do with the formal methods that                                 we've developed in an inclusive project                                 I don't know for any choices exam you                                 said earlier on The X said that the                                 utils are one of the most important                                 packages in debian on the premise                                 because we are paying off I I'm not sure                                 we have to look at a specific just go                                 back to the table apparently it's it                                 normally because you can see that                                 executives doesn't really have many                                 income and defensive I imagine that                                 there is in very important package that                                 depends on exactly zoe's package these                                 days on traffic come on Tasha                                 so dpkg utility business we actually                                 have the identity function for                                 physically active a method to to                                 factorize out these sort of packages to                                 find out whether effect is really                                 important because there's one in                                 extremely important a settlement we can                                 factor them dry in time to presented                                 yeah pretty equation that was a remark                                 just fills up for this brain research it                                 falls under research effort is over this                                 will not

version on the CBS snow shirt Nazi SS                                 regression said there is no black                                 freighter and I know of at least two                                 patches and the modular package it was                                 never updated sweet it has amazing                                      the web page doesn't this feel so over                                 school books in average football                                 concepts or research toys that's                                 difficult valium                                 with the extra videos from all the                                 different from an upstream project with                                 some point style not really right to                                 transfer requests in any way they are                                 opinions because the mackensee project                                 is nearing its end as well and she just                                 until                                                                  to realize the work of it so together                                 faculty tools maintains its going on                                 that it's sort of a bag of those                                 European programming projects so you                                 missed signal the bag extreme personally                                 we're all for just being like this just                                 to come back on the thing that I think                                 that you have a points not stemming from                                  Zack you see the job of researchers is                                  to publish papers and do stuff that is                                  new if you are doing stuff that someone                                  else or you have done before you are                                  spending the taxpayers money your salary                                  on quality was not meant to be spent so                                  actually working you maintain an old                                  software in office                                  for researchers it's something that is a                                  little bit outside of the job it really                                  should not be done and you are very                                  right they saying that we have no                                  mechanism that would allow us to make                                  sure that the software we develop when                                  it is the research remains afterwards I                                  think that's a systemic problem that                                  you're putting your finger off just not                                  Megan either we do it in our coffee or                                  three time or as we drop it they're just                                  honest and that is a very sincere it is                                  a great community round also to the                                  power people who tell me that's lead                                  yourself a normal course creating a                                  community around something if we can                                  know that you yourself are not going to                                  maintain it officer it after a while                                  it's easier said than done suppose you                                  said the year being receiving                                             you know how much she was                                  I'm just a simple video                                  so I give you accepted accepted figures                                  but I can tell you that where we hads                                                                                                             of them are academic partners and each                                  of them comes enough money at least to                                  hire one or two persons during the                                  iteration of the project like typically                                  PhD students and postdocs webpage noises                                  on this project to work on join swingers                                  so for the bottom Utley this you you can                                  you can about the estimator the                                  co-author of going on that problem you                                  say that European institution so that                                  open source is interesting and so if                                  they think it's interesting they should                                  consider the needs of open solo that's                                  to say you have a community around it                                  otherwise you make a nice thing and it                                  drops another nice thing and drops and                                  I've seen quite a lot of the thing it's                                  a contradiction in on the European level                                  to say open source it goes and then                                  diving guide will devote controls it's a                                  contradiction well I mean it's it's a                                  it's already                                                          recognizing the device in yourself of                                  open source software and they're putting                                  this in the impala for proposed its own                                  these days and you do get a death                                  appeared course of opposes you see                                  sections of all open source off Twitter                                  and they're telling the people should                                  put their assets are available for                                  everybody so this is already quite a                                  good thing now the poppin this I don't                                  know exactly what you mean this Fame                                  buttons of open source you mean like you                                  know it would say you have a project                                  practiced in two years the problem                                  doesn't exist the web pages disappear so                                  it's not attend severe and so on but                                  then I think the progress the same as                                  the one that the juniors can point it on                                  researchers because the people at the                                  European Union but setting up the                                  bakken's say have kind of the same                                  problem because towards say opposes say                                  you have to justify one obvious part of                                  the framework so ffb means means                                  framework programme which which is the                                  framework for for all this kind of                                  research programs now we're setting up                                  there is that which we want four maybe                                  five years or ten years and this is the                                  purpose only need something Regulus I                                  don't know what and after the times they                                  will have to justify to bother you in                                  Parliament or you being commissioned                                  letter F word spent a lot                                  and a lot of money on the specific goal                                  and then they'd have to sever now we are                                  going going to set up f v                                               be on something of a difference which                                  will be much bigger and much greater and                                  it will solve all problems of the                                  flipper so they also have to do                                  something for you something you ever                                  talk secure alarm you possible to just                                  bring this consideration up to I don't                                  know whatever way but through whatever                                  way but just give people in charge than                                  minus okay if possible this would not                                  have to be a research which is nothing                                  ungated some some institution something                                  good I don't know whether you can                                  whether you can bring this up to the                                  people in charge but i'm not saying but                                  by the way about it so I think invited                                  to be you can Commission product if they                                  call me and my role of even for the                                  video and if all other                                  so they are listening to us they're                                  asking how can we do this man then of                                  course any deity the worker is father is                                  huge so go to one single Island means                                  nothing but I mean there they are of                                  asian girl go communities which is so I                                  was amazed and then it doesn't mean that                                  the suggestions we making medical asset                                  to them will be you know implemented                                  today next year or in the next five                                  years Bri and I was helps to buy that                                  you could dependency free of the                                  European for that sort of different by                                  the way i recommend playing by their                                  rules of open source means that you do                                  your best in grating of you no one is                                  the guarantee that you will succeed so i                                  should we do have a bug tracking system                                  it's everything is on a forge but you                                  know on every force there are a lot of                                  project which others that so we tried it                                  so come to us and maintaining it where's                                  the minion would be that everything                                  would be approached enough early that's                                  all absolutely                                  when investing thing will use cousin you                                  get the new commission is exactly out of                                  oil that the code vanishes when the                                  website of the research project is bars                                  and there I know I didn't understand                                  that they were we to set up some sort of                                  morgue when you keep all the coded value                                  we try to find a project                                  very good example to specific should                                  always of project also done on                                  preparation with some industry a                                  cartilage yes you see my understanding                                  at practical DVD that i posit that                                  should take a real ocean research can                                  transform it into integration in some                                  concrete projects society this was for                                  me a complete tool the things you right                                  in here in this situation so okay that's                                  manage people because and it's just                                  going up to go transform make evolution                                  of software yeah diahann                                  project of invective talking us or our                                  building institutions and they are also                                  of course incorporating things which are                                  developed in this project intimacy                                  tippin's as far as I know there are no                                  concrete tools for this kind of data                                  presented here I should say that this is                                  already some kind of continuation of                                  work which includes it will shoot up                                  finish at the end of the Eagles project                                  so we started to go on this in the first                                  GOP project which was from                                                in my project includes it will be                                  are not really fades to continue working                                  on these constitutes your page to work                                  on we need to clarify that so there is                                  something that I've been wanting to say                                  for quite quite a while and I'm allowed                                  to say because I'm now part of the                                  project I don't deal with them that                                  either / one quickly is a rather                                  particular research project because it                                  starts it has its roots very strongly                                  with in free software Ralph can be need                                  a game developer for as long                                  and remember zach is some sets to the                                  right of daughters and those are people                                  who have been spending the proverbial                                  their proverbial cops is free time on                                  building communities on working free                                  software for years and years and years                                  and that is rather atypical of research                                  project so what you are saying you're                                  the issues you're raising with research                                  projects working on free software do not                                  necessarily apply to this particular                                  problem in the project but that's only                                  because of the particular people who are                                  working on this project and they do very                                  much apply to the system as a whole to                                  many other projects that the very                                  interesting research that could be used                                  but ends up not being used because the                                  people in the project are not involved                                  increase off do you have any so what's                                  the license of the software is PSD or                                  video has given you any constraints from                                  the episode program to license it in the                                  car                                  not at all not at all in fact this                                  usually vs so the European Union Justin                                  points                                                                 say ask the project leader you can find                                  the consortium agreement which means                                  that at the beginning of the project all                                  parties involved in the project have to                                  increase its a sign the contract it's a                                  week on two antennas are lost involved                                  in that we contact the things are                                  written up like what's going to have                                  those publications who's what's what is                                  your publication what will be the                                  license of software it's often your for                                  proprietary software who have to buy two                                  sided software who's being in which                                  which for a mortgage stuff like that                                  it's within the contract and the                                  European you just requires from us                                  deficit a structure country at the                                  beginning of a project and besides that                                  settlement could put us put any kind of                                  construction since it's a mate Miss                                  Perfect Money I could expect that the                                  public get something back in return I                                  absolutely will say I don't know I                                  raised the issue for me there should be                                  a constraining suffrage bill                                  do you know any other quite working with                                  the Commission work especially working                                  in the unit which has been funded this                                  project i'm not very very involved more                                  and more we are we are checking that                                  typically when it's an open source                                  project the chosen license makes sense                                  given the kind of exploitation direction                                  which which are identified when the                                  project is submitted so if you say it's                                  going to be PSD you like to explain why                                  this non-stop protected to the way                                  the elephant's okay now regarding the                                  use of a license just usually the                                  development of property software we                                  don't have any                                  we can tell any rule what we do is in                                  this is to continue                                  and the only constraint is that the                                  whole thing makes it go to make sense                                  but you don't have any and the financing                                  is at fifty percent that is give the                                  fathers of global is providing the other                                  fifty percent we do the results can be                                  provided that's that's a basic whole of                                  the game take on this topic should stop                                  because of time thanks everyone
