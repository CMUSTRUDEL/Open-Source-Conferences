Description: 
	and why you should not do it, yet prepare for itForking a project is never an easy task both on social and technical level.Mageia, like Libreoffice, is a big project born from a fork, and faced several issues regarding community and infrastructure. The lessons learned from forking can be generalized to any software project.

	                              what we expected this morning                               aspects so if you want to have some more                               details about the global organization                               you can have some detectable this this                               tendencies of from where my son and                               hashtag woman from Nigeria is not the                               material but journalist from thank Allah                               this is one of a night one of our fan                               support for Magica for and that's what                                we are going to explain me so we will                                take any questions and then after this                                talk and we have also                                to speak with us just a free trip to                                come and see us                                so the stuff was money that was read                                project                                so since                                                              this project was high dimensions                                especially on user science but what is                                tool and all all this kind of                                what Lance what we love in this project                                was the way community was managed when                                we put an assist to have users first                                you have a community we love to work                                together and tools and so on but varies                                away their purpose let's say that it was                                a disturbing experience the point for us                                today is not to explain why a business                                we fought because there are many many                                reasons for about it and I guess it's                                not the most interesting of this so we                                gotta say this let's explain what we                                want to improve energy distribution why                                we thought we want to change one of the                                vehicle meaning get the ecology take                                control over the renewal project so we                                want to the community the responsible of                                all aspects of the project meaning                                decision                                organization roll man and so on so the                                old project we managed car hardware                                Austin from the indecision and direction                                which was not the case before                                so as I said with this afternoon we'll                                explain the way we want to organize this                                project but in in for the big picture we                                have something like tensions from                                marketing to communication precarious                                translators and so on we have two meters                                for the head of each team's and these                                cylinders are part of what we call the                                conceive the constant is taking the main                                decisions of the roadmap and what to do                                with Virginia and how we are going to do                                it and the ball is a few people that                                will manage the Association I mean                                whether the legal stuff for Maria                                formaggi our community will be not only                                contributors but also users so we plan                                to have users really imply in inner in                                the decisions all and all disciplines                                both individuals and companies so what                                we want to put the first is people I                                remember a conference yesterday I guess                                it was a federal guy speaking about the                                importance of having trust in people and                                putting people that they're in in front                                so this is what we really want to do                                this measure we want to that's any any                                kind of contribute entering my senior                                project can learn something so we                                started we have already package shares                                and mentors                                we have for example                                                   at the moment and we have already did                                some type of                                                     learning how to package and join the                                official team of Nigeria we want also to                                be able at the end to create an economic                                model around material so that we can                                have this distribution to last to be to                                exist in coming years without having                                without the hurting by economic programs                                and so on and we want to do something                                else such as just yet another Linux                                distribution so this is this is the                                local Samardzija but it's just then it's                                being built at the moment so it's not                                the definitive one and if that we do but                                that we do for the trust ultra of Magica                                which should be done by the end of next                                week                                so our objectives generally speaking                                makes life easier for users so we will                                keep the the direct goal of non river                                that wants to have easy-to-use                                distribution but also for packages                                that's why we had quite a hard time to                                build other tools and make make it easy                                 to use for vacations during the project                                 we want also for the future from source                                 projects we have the big chance of                                 having inside the first contributors                                 magical people Italian experience in                                 technology in password in hardware                                 device design and so on so we want you                                 to be able to share this between the the                                 contributors                                 and we must to put really the community                                 at first place in a project that that's                                 a big goal for us                                 so this leads our arterial goals but we                                 work also for people that we who will                                 use virtually are to be able to                                 understand really what they have enhance                                 that system which is not another way the                                 case try to have something really use it                                 so let's see what happened in the real                                 knife have been able to match on one                                 side the open-source principles and on                                 the other side the economic context                                 which is not that easy                                 we announced the project that was at the                                 end of September we thought it took us                                 one month to set up releasing the basic                                 things and it took two or three months                                 so that was the first delay we have the                                 association set up we have to explain                                 the project for so to be sure that                                 people understand what we are doing this                                 island district is the governance that                                 was also a big subject quite tricky                                 because it's not the petitioner Francis                                 project that everybody can do everything                                 it's on one corner so we have now the                                 governance ready we have also to                                 organize different things so that they                                 can start working even if the big system                                 is not ready at the moment and we have                                 also to take the people aware of what is                                 happening it took us about five months                                 from September to now to set up all                                 these things set up the beach system                                 which is nearly ready now to bootstrap                                 the distribution which took nearly one                                 month and thousands of hours building                                 the packages and                                 the most difficult thing is to explain                                 people that things are happening even if                                 they cannot use it yet so cheap the                                 people motivated on this project even if                                 they cannot contribute now so that was                                 our communication communication                                 communication communication so at least                                 once a week of to have efficient                                 efficient communication on a different                                 step and also gets everyone to work                                 meaning it's not because all is not                                 really that we cannot organize things so                                 the goal was to to have everybody ready                                 when the first alpha will be out so                                 meaning the packages can submit                                 psychologist the translators are able to                                 submit translation and                                 so the the world media the working                                 Factory                                 so what we did is we just took what                                 exists in man without the and needs a                                 big work to clean order the technical                                 platform take time for it because it's                                 one condition to have people                                 contributing if it's even they can                                 contribute if it's always welcome there                                 are still not motivated                                 we had also to clean up sources because                                 we have some license license issues in                                 in old developments like jackets tools                                 so that age is also maybe we have very                                 summation that point also and this for                                 the distribution and finally first a                                 fact of                                                                we have something like                                                   in the machinery destroyed this is only                                 don't die                                 fifteen people so we expect to have much                                 much more a cage is coming in coming                                 lost we did not decide to a a to import                                 all the Sdn because what's good good                                 moment for us to make a lot of cleaning                                 removing old stuff not use and so                                 and we plan to have the truck stable                                 distribution ready for first opportunity                                 and also have all the organization                                 really ready means to have all cylinders                                 and all the process set up in the                                 audience                                 so if you want more information about                                 organization that we have another comes                                 from disaster movie explaining how we                                 organize                                 but I think everybody is technical focus                                 my joke so first one is the fog and the                                  is not just who takes a girl                                 different it in Amazon attention it                                 would work right it is for smaller                                 project but for distribution in frost                                 making clean everything that is artfully                                 well it's much easier to put together                                 everywhere because you do not expect to                                 change even if in the case of Nevada                                 everybody change the name of the first                                 time and we did also contact so this                                 time we will not do the same a walk                                 twice for some time and we plan to                                 finish everything for two reason the                                 first one is facilitate another or we                                 may be completely stupid and do stupid                                 things                                 new version it seems to be something                                 that depends oh wait demi-wedge                                 it because it's also something about                                 opera when you see the welcomes own                                 derivative of Madeira                                 well we think that certain things that                                 we want and you're our show on the brain                                 so the first thing was a father for to                                 clean everything completely to check is                                 original occurred in name to compare                                 results with Marco because they vanish                                 because it's free we want to respect                                 multiple footprints they invested lots                                 of money in it so we need to change that                                 and we have to also have a leading                                 design there was the icon that was we go                                 party with a multi vendor to D and we                                 want it to have something new let be                                 seen as the same was gonna go                                 beautifully done and this is took a lot                                 of time and the second forum was we we                                 wanted fit package                                 winces so for people who know the other                                 GCC walks you need                                                      for lighting this vision is the same it                                 is a light distribution compares organic                                 distributions so that's the GCC we are                                 good so which is to take packages to be                                 an ampere we use some taxes to see                                 whether comes from our Emma                                 distributions just a prevention and so                                 formal guide was MVP with Russian ago so                                 we have we compile everything taking                                 what was we compiled on movement system                                 and what was that we took the times we                                 move all the one to try to remove all                                 batches like everything that should have                                 been a sense of scale everything because                                 finally incorrect I found some                                 the veggies and somebody that were                                 simply won't go well and the reckoning                                 of two cats three months for under your                                 terms and packages which is quite good                                 but still I think we could go WOW why we                                 didn't whom to change how much because                                 everything every time the Whizzer for                                 everybody wants to change everything                                 we are the fruits of faith of the birth                                 until the warning message from cádiz                                 teaching from the government is too                                 overly lax fpm for using your ginger                                 like you that's not such a bad idea but                                 we can start from where we are hoping to                                 keep it this way                                 so we did some cleaning but will refuse                                 most of them because we wanted to have a                                 good is ready and opinion video for                                 people in those of Monica box we also                                 supported digitally and sometimes                                 reported more positively with somewhat                                 external clearly people you may have                                 seen a presentation which being a                                 Michigan and so we decided to make                                 everything super variable that you can                                 see the program is someone we like to I                                 say Japan for a cheaper you know these                                 are people's life                                 so regarding the grid system again you                                 wanted to change everything so if you                                 intend to fork over Linux distribution I                                 think the first thing is to change                                 nothing just one something ready and                                 working system transition video priority                                 so it okay we did some cleaning we use                                 the puppet manager everything so we can                                 have at least test instance from a                                 system in a point of view it's much                                 better than having everything done in                                 tradition and we plan for Vic use a good                                 system after the first village to see                                 the base of something or better so what                                 people suggested to use open sewage                                 system so I went with all these people                                 when you                                 Vince you something else peak of the                                 fedora every system which is extra nice                                 and basically everything is nice with                                 some different calendar goods so we have                                 an idea and once you're a good system                                 ridiculous underestimates the life of                                 the fermentation and the Barney's                                 program human face when I read them when                                 I did the panning it was like the fact                                 thing would be will be enough and it                                 takes three months so don't do any                                 installation it will be warm you can do                                 it but just like when you are in your                                 mind just say three four five five more                                 times because we will a program and then                                 I started storage permission it was a                                 nice day                                 interesting opposite                                 that some things that you will never do                                 except for people very important with                                 our architecture or the Opera                                 is clean step of that because they need                                 to contact the time we only do every                                    years so of course it was a total                                 nightmare for example for services take                                 one from IBM for everyone eg for eveyone                                 sharra Ferger things go wrong and so we                                 have like                                                        dependency with a specific version and                                 once we stopped at that someone said                                 maybe we could simply do a Java                                 faster yes before and so for the next                                 time we will talk it should be ready                                 because repent whether wind up with                                 swaps for Iran for meals for SH forward                                 it's fascism and to check that people                                 can still afford an education and for                                 the same reason we are super rich to the                                 world the world system in documentation                                 so people can adjust                                 where the owner distribution and it                                 should wrong it should be done political                                 times                                 so since people are like oh I saw buffer                                 and we know we start focused we took the                                 money I will visit away we will be the                                 second best system which is basically                                 empty so it was fast still much patience                                 migration then we stopped once a very                                 good which is a kind of a painless                                 process                                 I know India announced we have never                                 build anything available we are in the                                 parent distribution we need to be                                 sweetie                                 so one of the problem we had was we                                 didn't want to be stupid                                 everything from the start because it was                                 new side and the problem is a crypto is                                 kind of you want to do the things of                                 section well but it's very complex                                 we try to create the key if you want to                                 come to see some historical moments we                                 try to meet                                 two hours with the complete system using                                 a sham PFC quite to Spreitzer key among                                 the admins or no engines can have used                                 it but if someone needs the movie you                                 can still move on sweetie it's a fight                                 at work and yeah as I and we say there                                 is no bad system that we use so much fun                                 time                                 usually people notice that it's not it's                                 brutal and complain and service one at                                 big time which is never noticed and                                 which has almost all the time virgin I                                 think that if you are part of this                                 region if I just often and I'll see your                                 awkward time it will irritate and how                                 painful it will be                                 but you will access videos in stuff like                                 Java heating Shabbat movie billed as                                 Canada a scared Jesus indeed necessity                                 is that mean                                 there is loose everywhere and adjuster                                 painful so maybe people have some                                 question                                 that is progress on the part of the                                 process time                                 I'm sure those people yeah                                 how are you funded however we founded                                 the pencil myself that some things that                                 we discuss for the next work when we
