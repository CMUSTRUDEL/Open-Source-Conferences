Title: Towards the Comparative Analysis of Evolving Libre Software
Publication date: 2011-02-11
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	Most empirical studies on the evolution and quality of libre software focus on individual software projects. Instead, we aim to empirically study, analyse and compare software distributions . We are interested in understanding how the environment that surrounds the considered systems affects their evolving quality. Therefore, we take into account different points of view from different stakeholders.Our goals are: Help developers to asses, control and improve the quality of the project they work on (in this case, software distributions)  Advise users on quality criterion when choosing a software distribution Gain a better understanding of evolving software environments As a pilot case, we use and analyse package-related metrics for Debian and Ubuntu using data extracted from the Ultimate Debian Database (UDD). We observed an increasing amount of sharing between both projects' communities since the establishment of the Ubuntu project, in 2004.Even if the standard UDD has been our first choice as both data source and analysis tool, it has not been as effective as we first thought. We are now looking for other data sources and (reusing existing and/or building new) analysis tools that allow us to extend this study to other distributions.*We define a project's environment as the set of all possible artifacts, entities (communities, projects), processes (development and business models) and other aspects that might influence the system under study.

	                              Marge Antigua I'm right now at the                               University of most important and my                               research is about distributions that's                               why i asked the co him nothing I                               what are we doing this coming why are                               why am I doing this are being involved                               with free software for                                                the user first of course and then as a                               community builder English and Eileen                                always curious about how this movement                                works of people were all the                                         informatics I'm not I am I don't                                consider myself as a program a much more                                like and I speak or something else and                                when I have the opportunity I would                                suffer hd                                                             selling the same sentence play soccer                                again for sure                                basically I'm working for a research                                project which has the late objective to                                golf the locals in the South Asian                                Belgium Bologna and think through their                                process and practicing basically our                                first general goal is to have the                                developers we believe that by you cannot                                improve what you cannot measure and the                                idea is to take the objective data                                metrics quantitative data from                                activities and another person                                or second grateful people to account                                users I mean we should ask some                                questions like I want to help some kind                                of product and I don't know which                                product to help which trailer and help                                our I i think i have these two pieces of                                software comes basically do the same                                thing which one should i consider                                   maybe which one more chances to be                                so that's a problem I mean while                                focusing on the distribution I don't                                know what's your background is some of                                us in research activities or not so                                completely during just accompany keep                                the budget it's raise your hands                                there are few basically basically there                                are their main studies on face topper                                projects but most of them focus on                                single application I mean we are                                acknowledged up this emissions are key                                enable the user access to applications I                                mean it's I think that the fact that                                distribution exists is one of the                                reasons why this software is optional                                but there are there are not so many toys                                on the solutions I I believe actually I                                have a paper with American people that                                said that one of the possible bosses was                                the lack of data maybe it's true maybe                                it's just too much they there are many                                policies but the fact is that there                                aren't many scientific publications on                                distributions                                somebody to do so                                how which would soar or approach how is                                it like what we are we are in more                                interested very interested in                                understanding the way the systems are                                developed so we are not just in the                                circle but we also want to take into                                account the difference of games and the                                different kinds of view from different                                stakeholders that means developers users                                manager Germany finally we define what                                we call server environments                                which is the surrounding of any software                                project and is composed by each every                                element of an effective what's what's                                the software environment for consented                                for everything that might affect and                                influence the product evolution soccer                                fans entities processes and many other                                things of course when we talk about this                                we we we have knowledge there's there                                are many many things so we come for the                                night                                as you can see over there                                somewhere prolly there are basically two                                kinds of software products there are                                many that from our part come up from our                                point of view dr to japanese and real                                private or dissolution the difference                                between individual production and                                distribution is done say distribution                                others many unrelated problems but                                syndicated from different stakeholder                                those stakeholders are the key essence                                of what we call environment actually we                                should add their other projects that                                influence the Wonderstone                                 of course the parable say we all know                                 what they are they are Chinese finishes                                 and if we analyze superficially the                                 recent evolution of each one the testing                                 process of coop additionally there is                                 small unmarked more vulnerable work                                 being done effectively a way across into                                 products actually does we are interested                                 in analyzing in the first case how this                                 project evolved on how they cooperate I                                 will I cannot show you what results                                 because we have just started to company                                 but the idea of this talk is much more                                 than                                 giving you answers to ask questions and                                 to get some feedback from developers so                                 we used the ultimate AF database data                                 source and you can check the results                                 maybe the numbers fast I was slightly                                 chamber we come to check until things                                 that you already know was that would be                                 lovely faster you can see the evolution                                 the package number and that's number of                                 sub packages sorry Jess yes didn't I                                 think actually i don't remember exactly                                 there is a sting shown between binary                                 packages and no nonviolent bunnies I                                 don't remember I think it's the final                                 packages because a forest I remember                                 there are more non binary is coming                                 there that may mean what is called the                                 old architecture me no comparable and                                 but the most important thing is is one                                 that of course there is more more                                 across it from infertility for what we                                 were looking for me not only amount of                                 packages we are allies many other things                                 but we didn't answer meaningful                                 themselves for instance we try to                                 analyze back history using unity but it                                 turned out to be a source in a way that                                 it's not designed to have all of the                                 history of beach bar all the indications                                 you can get it but not indication that's                                 as far as i know i contacted some                                 developer so it's a design                                 characteristic but the good things that                                 are still using free software we can                                 modify it and we are thinking about                                 using a customized you need for next to                                 the study                                 basically                                 American in the way that lady s to reuse                                 existing software mainly fools developed                                 for the floss metrics project by the                                 newest soft research group in Spain they                                 and other people remember like                                 like for instance made in this analyzers                                 backtracked and gatherers it without                                 songs other words mean tools that                                 analyze the repositories different kind                                 repositories which the source code                                 mainly back tracking system and an email                                 database with with that they actually                                 for a year of different sources and to                                 condense all that information                                 engineering the domain                                 allowing any other application and                                 external one who analyze it change                                 matrix for instance once you have that                                 database you could develop the software                                 tool that would allow you to go deeper                                 and the fisa metrics and then obtain a                                 table with no results but so of course                                 we have many many open questions in                                 respect of validation we are sorry for                                 the hub problems using                                 we are other types of of course we don't                                 want to reinvent the wheel I mean and                                 the colleague of mine who is also                                 researching this summer project                                 framework to do similar things but his                                 needs are not exactly nine so we are                                 working together in to analyzing which                                 parts of the not software can be reused                                 I found many other foods I want another                                 faculty are interesting but there are                                 many tools available some kinds of                                 things we want to do the end to videos                                 I think the biggest challenge is to                                 actually come outside generic enough to                                 say to include all of the aspects do you                                 want funnel a database design a very                                 critical step and I'm very important but                                 then he has to work in a waste                                 bottom ass the castle data to the device                                 in December I I come to you in no no                                 that's analytics                                 King Terenas                                 we are considered                                 maybe loosen up so i don't know i can i                                 don't know how many of you know about                                 humans versus the one of the product                                 across it is not packages gets part of a                                 nice image                                 possible the partial outcome is work                                 regarding the perspective we are                                 considering using a software front line                                 perspective someone product line means                                 that you have a main live production                                 with software companies and viability                                 models your face of God problem that                                 means that each repository of any                                 solution th-th-this official repository                                 could be considered product line and                                 each time you install the system it                                 would be a support role in the availab                                 it has a base in base system and set                                 efficient I mean you might install a web                                 server tonight install a desktop                                 environment or not so there are                                 different features and some                                 make a software problem from this                                 perspective another another thing we are                                 considering I mean besides we are                                 considering analyzing analyzing release                                 composition and its relationship with                                 teachers I mean which component service                                 tribution relate to which ensures that                                 we recognize it's not an easy buddy I                                 mean I'm Nigeria user and I know that                                 there are many problems in defining even                                 the even though there is updated                                 graphics tool that can customize it                                 somewhere use for this task it's not it                                 does not include all of the software and                                 sometimes it does not equal other                                 possible task because the problem is how                                 to define tasks are totally fine fiction                                 action once you have the definitions                                 achieve                                 we are also considering converting a                                 package code against vanilla code last                                 but not least is it work to actually                                 package some something I mean that's                                 something that came out yesterday in                                 formal seminar which is possible similar                                 solution and discussing up with dollar                                 researchers researchers from the action                                 earring why should we wait for one or                                 two more and in order to have something                                 wants the added value that to package                                 something adds to the something I mean                                 why not using model releases like art                                 for instance I don't know it's an open                                 question I don't have the answer I don't                                 want to let them be making something but                                 people discuss like                                 so I have some more details but i don't                                 know i don't think most of you are                                 interested so it's much quicker than i                                 expected but if you have any doubts or                                 any questions or any shouldn't be really                                 really help thank you very much                                         I am actually I'm waiting I think steph                                 analyst for the next oh yeah so yes I                                 know actually we we know there are many                                 european union founded research projects                                 related to play soccer and coffee are                                 their battles some of them are already                                 finished some of them are still ongoing                                 yes we don't become some contacts with                                 people working for those projects                                 actually will be another person                                 hace                                                                     he will speak to horrible how to do is                                 so if they come and can't have any                                 hunters that much contact but yes we are                                 of course it yes the focus are dating                                 different but this there are somehow                                 related                                 if yes first                                 yeah that's a very good person we don't                                 have a results yet in the way that we                                 just started the implementation phase I                                 mean those results of junkies                                 independent budgets identity because                                 actually or okay we or a deal was                                 finalized the package reading the                                 information they were love without there                                 are many research studies that analyze                                 related information there are many many                                 many of them but one of the things that                                 makes distributions special is the                                 existence of a package Sharon I mean you                                 have some kind of needs of a problem if                                 a module there anything but the                                 difference between that kind of                                 hierarchy and the one of the packages is                                 that usually different I give any                                 different problems at least                                 are developed by by different my very                                 dependent developers I mean usually when                                 you develop a software even even you                                 subcontract out to be the portion of it                                 all of the software is centralized                                 centrally managed in a way unit on the                                 other one individual institution is not                                 the case so to have a high degree of                                 since not here or disorderly that would                                 be something not free of the certainty                                 constructively so direction got stuck in                                 case                                 but or or idea was to analyze a visual                                 information but we use the UDTs episodes                                 and we try to build the charity                                 and when we are we actually I have a                                 student and developing small software to                                 do that but I think it started you sound                                 but the idea is to the way we haven't                                 done much developing an amazing tools                                 actually at work sorry actually most of                                 our that's a mining work if you can do                                 in a way just in my hand so we are                                 working on ultimate ice in the process                                 that will deal with in Australia                                 push                                 what do we want to compare our different                                 decision that's a very interesting                                 question I didn't believe them because I                                 didn't think somebody doesn't diba the                                 idea is to analyze them the quality of                                 this solution for different ones to be                                 innocent people they're the main one the                                 main channel is here is to define                                 quality I mean I show you some                                 you use                                 oh yes                                 we can develop a geek England sketch dqm                                 means and gold question metric paradigm                                 which is research para lined up in the                                 first place you sex which holds you want                                 to achieve for instance I want to prove                                 the the embargo with solving process                                 then you ask yourself questions related                                 to duck for instance how long does it                                 take to fix a gun and then you define                                 sort of matrix relating with that                                 questions of course that's a metric ton                                 great the difference with service                                 question for instance you can measure in                                 the imaging in the wire average time to                                 pull out the bar or the average time to                                 report in the biopsy there are many in                                 your case of disco one or is the                                 relationship between developers and                                 regarding picture implementation because                                 as we said before we are switching the                                 perspective we are considering using a                                 software product line based on so that's                                 strong equated with features                                 popularity is a quality of a particular                                 picture relating to the tournament of                                 food and our feature that have a lot of                                 incoming I think dependencies more                                 popular they have a better quality a                                 nerve terminal research question the                                 train sometimes in this case we                                 encounter many difficulties define me                                 because we didn't have we didn't know or                                 we didn't fully no information we have                                 become available so but in this case we                                 you have some propulsive magic happen                                 three this is not the only geek um we've                                 developed we haven't ever many but this                                 one would be next Talon all for the                                 package comparison                                 for instance we are considering shooting                                 the popularity as amount of gift of god                                 that's really simple but the defining                                 quality is wow really really complicated                                 because if you if you analyze research                                 papers you will find almost as quality                                 definitions of research paper so it's                                 spite / topologies                                 because we enjoy these two combined                                 matrixsynth inebriation police about the                                 amount of power cords and the ratio                                 between packet packages on container                                 those are those would be matrix national                                 quality in the way that I know there's a                                 study under the end up saying that                                 states that a possible dose for the                                 delay in the releases it would be the                                 increasing from the complexity of the                                 system so if you have more or less                                 insane amount of developers of                                 maintenance and they have each time more                                 and more packages well you come a very                                 little because you can scale until a                                 certain point but you cannot stay gadot                                 under hedges fall so we are also trying                                 to measure the development maybe flu                                 and also to attend two pockets that                                 means seven that's regarding the                                 question of is it actually warm too                                 heavily package something I mean we all                                 know that decisions modify sort of the                                 package that's why you come the original                                 source code and we each one perhaps                                 you are some same days you modified                                 somehow so dr. darshan there's this                                 question again so is it actually work                                 too heavily package or do you should                                 just do a rapper and chicken to your                                 distribution and there are many metrics                                 break into the pendant                                                 that's the title given to write any                                 other question                                 oh thank you very much for your time                                 number see if any of funny one of you                                 wants to discuss of line I will be                                 sitting over there okay I'll be right                                 over
