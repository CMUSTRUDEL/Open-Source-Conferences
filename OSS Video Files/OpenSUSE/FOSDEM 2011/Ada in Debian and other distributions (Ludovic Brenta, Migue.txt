Title: Ada in Debian and other distributions (Ludovic Brenta, Migue
Publication date: 2011-02-06
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	This talk will:briefly describe Ludovic's work maintaining the Ada part of GCC as part of the larger Debian-GCC team;describe the Debian Policy for Ada packages; why one is needed and why it is written the way it is;compare (in a constructive way, obviously) Debian with other distributions that also have good support for Ada, in particular Gentoo and FreeBSD, and with complementary third-party efforts such as the GNU Ada project on SourceForge[2] and MacAda[3] "GNAT for Macintosh";propose coordination between distributions on how to package Ada software.Followed by a live demonstration

	                              okay so thanks for coming we are here                               involved in the one on a half hours lost                               about ada ingredient all certain other                               distributions I'll be doing the first                               part of this talk for about                                          and then take some questions                               and the second part Miguel here will                               provide you the line                               Villas how to create a package also made                                us offering an opinion so about this                                slice I'm going to skip over very                                quickly over the first few slides                                because we've already covered them in                                phosphorus and patience here                                so I'm going to skip over very quickly                                and then I'm going to delete of this                                this year's presentations and with some                                new material which is fairly technical                                of something to spend some more time so                                I'm going to just read the novel this                                light say so to skip over on this one                                and the next few ones because it is you                                either all know about or you don't care                                suppose this is how the in distribution                                works the one interesting points on this                                slide is the                                                           and this is especially important as                                because ADA because there is no other                                binary distribution                                the pictures in fact too busy animal                                first of all the first distribution ever                                provide support for mix or previously                                the data                                and how does that really work this is                                really how those engine package and we                                do all our work in the unstable yeah                                this is where we cuff lows that the                                inversions of our packages ones when we                                say that the packages have reached a                                sufficient level of maturity of                                stability that they automatically                                migrate testing once they are in testing                                they can be replaced with new versions                                and ones testing no longer has any                                release critical words and this covers                                all packages that it becomes stable this                                is happening this weekend                                thirty-six please ladies disc matters so                                it's not major because this is the first                                relation to you the fact that the                                releases take two years is actually a                                good point for the target audience I'm                                looking at what will see that means                                so what do we provide in delians for the                                internet or Google the first parts are                                the first set of packages that we                                provide is really the development                                by itself it consists of the cannot                                compiler cannot is actually the end of                                nonsense of GCC so it is really of GCC                                the packaging words that I do that is                                there are some complimentary packages                                like aces pages is a library that allows                                an ADA program to read the abstract                                syntax trees provided by the compiler                                and thereby to analyze other ADA                                programs so you                                taps into the compiler to Isaiah                                programs and there are some interesting                                applications to that possible classics                                pretty printer you can have there is a                                tool which is also in there                                which is roots checker it will try very                                hard to find bugs that even the compiler                                doesn't see and you can customize this                                by writing new leads very easily                                gdb in years past we have to have a                                special fast version of gdb to                                understand the data syntax to be able to                                debug on our programs but this is no                                longer the case as this dispatches of an                                integrated upstream so they are now in                                the story TV so you can simply reuse the                                existing - ok                                bori or that's another interesting                                package its new its police it wasn't                                present in the previous version segment                                this is an extensive framework to create                                distributed programs that is programs                                that runs across a network of machines                                rather than a single machine and                                unfortunately I can't spend a lot of                                time on this but basically in the Heder                                language there is a special needs panics                                and xp for distributed systems that                                makes it possible to write distributed                                systems in the language not by calling                                library calls but it's really both of                                the language we declare some types and                                 procedures and then you simply add a                                 fragment in the source codes and oh by                                 the way this is a remote whole interface                                 and Shiva epic artistry                                 so it's all integrated in the compiler                                 and it gets that the runtime support is                                 provided like for the world along with                                 some utilities district allows you to                                 specify how your program is distributed                                 across different machines in that GPS

                               that is based on ages so it uses a                                 system so it reads the abstract syntax                                 trees from the compiler and then it                                 extracts documentation about your                                 sources and M is diminished here now                                 with trusted reference

check for                                 compliance of sources with some                                 corporations or to the void but or to                                 try to detect us before the hit then you                                 have number of logging frameworks like                                 they pay one Arvin and a units are both                                 unit testing frameworks intent choice                                 and then there's a VHDL compiler and                                 simulator which is written in Ada it's                                 actually not just because native is also                                 another GCC from                                                   really takes VHDL source code and a Miss                                 objector just like any other GCC and                                 it's a program written in a the search                                 has to you know and you have to compile                                 it using ADA                                 then you get the ADA                                                  manual in a variety of formats and this                                 is the first in because the ADA                                      reference manuals is the official ISO                                 standard for the language and I can't                                 think of any other language by the way                                 for which the ISO standard is freely                                 available and part of its main the main                                 part of their game which is the FST go                                 point so you can get this iso standard                                 you can modify it you can copy it you                                 can reformat it you can do whatever you                                 like                                 and so it's provided as HTML as info as                                 PDF as plain text so you can browse it                                 very easy another good thing with this                                 ISO standards and it is quite readable                                 as far as standards govern so it's                                 become customary for for ADA programmers                                 to refer to the ISO standard when you                                 discuss precise aspect of the language                                 the second part the second set of                                 languages are also provided in Debian is                                 an extensive set of libraries when I                                 started the mekinese libraries back in                                                                                                      libraries available in any Linux                                 distributions so our face basically one                                 library in each application domain that                                 might be relevant to programmers so you                                 got pretty much to one library at least                                 one library or anything you'd like to do                                 so you have florist which is a POSIX                                 interface it's actually an

which                                 is much cleaner that's inducing the                                 secret                                 you never against error results instead                                 of get exceptions for example that's one                                 one life stain with                                 is a

                         allows you to tune on the web server in                                 ADA or to embed a web server in your aid                                 application it's library so you can                                 simply link your application with this                                 web server and then you could choose to                                 provide both a

self-contained the web application                                 server which is one file because if you                                 like you can have all your data and all                                 the resources compiled into your                                 executable program so this makes it                                 possible                                 for example to write an application with                                 some data and enter an interactive web                                 application compile it into one                                 statically linked executable and simply                                 copy that executable logger to a remote                                 server and then you have a web server                                 security with it is very good because                                 it's all statically checked it's all                                 subjected to the very stringent rules of                                 Veda that try to prevent us before                                 meeting so you get all the benefits of a                                 strongly typed language all the benefits                                 are aesthetically linked executable and                                 all the benefits of a compiled language                                 because it runs fast so it's really                                 quite interesting then we have gtk ADA                                 which is neither binding to gtk in our                                 text as well the reason main reason why                                 draggers textbooks for beginner                                 programmers who don't learn                                 that Lafayette ready to create graphical                                 interfaces so the text tools is a nice                                 no it's easier for the beginner                                 programmer to learn to write hello world                                 in text mode and provided when I use                                 simple stuff like that that's really                                 didactic then you have XML Aida which is                                 a full XML suite for ADA                                 it doesn't just include a Dom parser and                                 a sax parser but it also includes a                                 whole suite of unicode's supports                                 functionality because Unicode is part of                                 XML then you have not one of two                                 bindings to databases we have one which                                 is made which supports several database                                 backends I think suppose PostgreSQL                                 SQLite MySQL are not not                                 and a couple other little bit and then                                 those ODBC interface and then you have a                                 PQ which is a more general framework for                                 database programming that currently only                                 has the PostgreSQL documents composites                                 but the other factor is honor in                                 developments coming then you have                                 libraries of scientific computing you                                 can find into PL results and GMT I think                                 which is the new multi precision library                                 some Terminator binding to it so you can                                 pull in this library with your ADA                                 programs then open token is a library                                 that allows you to write letters and                                 parcels without resorting to LexA not                                 because you actually write your say                                 recursive descent parsers directly in                                 Haida using this library and they're                                 very very easy and fast to like it's                                 actually easier to write                                 is impossible                                 Nexen yet templates partner that's a                                 companion library to the ADA web server                                 what it does is that effects a template                                 with some placeholders and it will                                 replace the phrase placeholders with                                 data which you provide so it's actually                                 was a WS normally use is to provide                                 dynamic web pages and think of it like                                 the a derivative Java server pages then                                 our valve is a specialist scientific                                 application which leverages fully-formed                                 it is a distributed data acquisition                                 framework which allows you to run the                                 runs of metrics each machine acquires                                 some data from some sources apply some                                 filters to it and then collects the                                 results collects in one single place and                                 sent those results to a central server                                 for post-processing                                 and it's a framework in that you can                                 write new filters and you data sources                                 and you data transformations as shared                                 libraries as plugins                                 and you can write these filters in data                                 or you can write them in C++ both                                 languages are supported                                 so oh no they are talking about squeeze                                 which is release now we have about one                                 event                                                             compiles and prepackaged and ready to go                                 for the for the end user which I believe                                 is the largest distribution in existence                                 now                                 now look more about cannot compile it                                 like I said earlier cannot is really the                                 front end of GCC it's an integrated in                                 GCC there are two places where we can                                 get nuts one is the Free Software                                 Foundation website the GCC near the door                                 and the other is the company and                                 therefore this company has the original                                 authors of the Phoenix it was founded by                                 the originals of those not his business                                 model is to provide support services to                                 paying customers and the software is                                 always free so a paying customer base is                                 support contractor a decor and receives                                 the compiler under a free software                                 license along with all the other                                 libraries and of course actually                                 remember a number of free software                                 organizations there's they spit on the                                 balls I think it was still in committee                                 at GCC and they're very active in the                                 business level in general what do they                                 do in there in addition to providing the                                 compiler to paying customers they also                                 provide a pure GPL edition of their                                 compiler and libraries to anyone who                                 wants it so you can download these                                 batteries from their website and install                                 them on a number of platforms so the                                 support window                                 supports an activist and the support                                 Farias editions of Linux and you can get                                 all the sources under a few GPL license                                 there are a few people who don't like                                 this the fact that even the runtime                                 library that the compiler is under GPL                                 because that implies that when they                                 write beta software if they want to                                 distribute the software to other people                                 then they must do some of the terms of                                 the GTR in contrast he should take GCC                                 from the Free Software Foundation then                                 he gets the runtime library with the                                 runtime library exception English                                 license is GPL version                                                 library inception so this allows people                                 to write proprietary software in Veda                                 using a free compiler                                 so the policy that I've been using in                                 Debian since                                                            one version of this compiler and provide                                 only one in Debian but what is very well                                 now the consequence of that is that all                                 the libraries are combined in the same                                 compiler and they are all compatible                                 with one another and by the way there                                 this line is really relevant for                                 previous versions of GCC where it wasn't                                 a GPL version                                                         Foundation version of GCC had a special                                 exception with special language which is                                 identical in spirit to the current                                 runtime                                 it's this slice really for historical                                 realities so a little history phone I                                 did since I started maintaining GCC or                                 not in Debian the first thing I did was                                 I packaged the then current version of                                 Dentistry in the                                                   sudden                                 even older version of GCC at the time to                                                                                                         to download the sources to the compiler                                 but there was no public database so I                                 decided to use the Debian package system                                 and then I started receiving                                 the reports from various people and                                 follow the person maybe two years I had                                 about                                                             reproduces which I forwarded upstream to                                 beta for and they eventually fixed most                                 of them after that in subsequent version                                 of the Genesis wish to renew GCC because                                 they became integrated into GCC and so                                 now this is no longer applicable in the                                 upstream of Mozilla database contains                                 all the reports what I did though was                                 challenging for me an interesting was to                                 provide two new libraries produced from                                 the sources of GCC one which I called                                 live at VSN it contains those parts of                                 the compiler does image and then read                                 back the abstract syntax trees which is                                 the cause of Asus uses so that with this                                 library it becomes possible for Asus to                                 share with the compiler the exact same                                 color and so by construction that is                                 warranty that basis is                                 is compatible with a compiler otherwise                                 you might get into trouble with other                                 distributions if you if you compile your                                 program with cannot see em is the                                 abstract syntax trees and then you try                                 to read them back the basis of things                                 says love under longer in forward the                                 providers in longer which instantly                                 refuses to processes trees this is gonna                                 be possible in Debian because they shall                                 sink over the other library is network                                 manager which is under GPL                                 because it's not part of the runtime                                 memory properly it's really part of the                                 compiler this is the part that reads                                 into project files another if expand                                 your project files are right now because                                 the beginner will explain that to you in                                 detail later but basically let's say                                 that the ADA language provides for a                                 separate combination internal image                                 which implies that a compiler must be                                 implemented                                 managing to make it has to detective                                 balances between source files it has to                                 choose which was me to be recompiled                                 which me not and that it has to somehow                                 to find to discover all the Zetas                                 sources to see which ones are up to date                                 and what the object files are so that's                                 what working for example this library's                                 our geography RJ is now shared between                                 the compiler with GPS awesome question                                 yes these libraries are is used by GCC                                 or are they this is just an adjacent                                 agent they are just in the end the                                 reason is that the patch is to create                                 those libraries are quite invasive and                                 I'm currently trying to that the problem                                 is that they bring those to the supports                                 that's that's a big problem with these                                 patches and I'm not really support did                                 not exist when I created those patches                                 now it is                                 a default of jesusí also I'm trying to                                 restore Maithili support and then I will                                 submit is in patches upstream so for now                                 they are on there                                 so a little bit of history and about                                 violence in past versions that young so                                 as you can see with each new version of                                 them yeah I settled with one version of                                 the company and decided to support that                                 one so since X we have support for                                 bouquet previously but I said early on                                 this was the first time ever that                                 in a different plan together previously                                 in Lenny I added support for syndrome                                 long term supports which is interesting                                 for embedded applications in addition to                                 zero cost exception I had a debugging                                 packages for everything                                 but in today's versions please now we                                 have a new updated identify state which                                 I'm going to do detail now                                 that's that my glass relationship like I                                 said very state moves and if supports in                                 in Debian but this time I have been                                 watching a movie without anyone needing                                 to leave a party libraries also try to                                 make it easier to construct cross                                 compilers there are several people from                                 an armed trusted in cross compilers                                 targeting                                 four things that we agreed my reward but                                 basically that's the reason why I'm                                 doing all this and I take the other                                 provided in say this first go up the red                                 line is the earliest one corresponds to                                 but not package when I started with this                                 only only in a compiler and around this                                 time the maths Pakistan became empty and                                 simply depends on the current version of                                 the compiler so this coming with this                                 point which was really GCC for one with                                 the other support was introduced and as                                 Italy at one point is surpassed the                                 default version                                 look at this red line has number of                                 people who use the defaults and the                                 other lines are people who don't use any                                 folks they don't have to be supporting                                 fighters that they don't                                 package very recently the device let's                                 go festival weekend using for one I                                 really don't know what to think of this                                 part a lot of people started using your                                 an old version of Damian suddenly going                                 away to be some a certain place some                                 some foster place where they have fight                                 could be divine yeah so yes maybe it's a                                 big cluster using hundreds of companies                                 and well it goes to say that this if                                 they are using and I think this                                 corresponds to tool anything you find                                 any so there is no edge so these are                                 people who still using etched from                                      but it's a cluster running now for the                                 first time stable ourselves in                                 as we just put it up reading at all and                                 talk to some hospitals maybe they                                 changed file or come here and now it's                                 numbers that is just a block from the                                 Debian service no cannot accomplish what                                 Commons is a project I install the EEC                                 or carries on the mission and

                       you can see probably by using buddy back                                 yeah                                 okay now a little bit more details about                                 how HR libraries are focused in Dublin                                 they're not really very specialist for                                 our barista so it doesn't dig in policy                                 for ADA mandates that every library must                                 consist of at least two packages                                 preferably three at least three packages                                 preferably for the three packages of                                 runtime every the development library                                 classic and then the debugging library                                 containing the debugging supports we                                 just from the language and then                                 optionally the documentation cycles so                                 this is all classic for the embarrassed                                 this means that if you want to run the                                 program that needs a library the only                                 need to install these                                 package if you want to develop this                                 library then in addition the best                                 package possibility learning symbols                                 package that means that people who                                 simply want to use the program don't                                 have to install the development                                 environment just abundantly I believe is                                 this is true for most distributions done                                 with it                                 not just any the game provides for three                                 possible relationships we can packages                                 in fact there's a there's a post one                                 race relationship                                 so one package can depend on another                                 while beggars can't even recommends                                 another package and the factors can                                 suggest another package underneath                                 Debian installer will use these                                 appearances                                 you can ask it to NASA recommended                                 package                                    now what makes these or whatever makes                                 the ADA packaging a little bit more                                 special is the way that we place the                                 files provided by the net packages in a                                 consistent place so all the libraries                                 are in the same place so it's very easy                                 for a maker program to discover what                                 libraries are installed on the system                                 and to discover what is available to                                 them as a program that they can reuse                                 basically all the sources journeyed to                                 this directory users share ADA ADA a                                 news flash library and libraries                                 with the name of the ladies this is a                                 fastening that I didn't choose myself                                 because it was proposed to earlier as                                 politic new ADA environment                                 specification which was a very old                                 attempt of standardizing the way that                                 people would install libraries and their                                 development systems I decided to be                                 compliant to this proposal and not try                                 to invent my own so now this is the                                 de-facto if you like to a standard for                                 where people expect a library to means                                 for every library provides a project                                 file in fact this is the pollak GTR                                 project this is mandatory for the Libyan                                 policies greater and in fact not all                                 upstream libraries provide project                                 but since they are required in debian we                                 simply add a new product parts which                                 library and now people have gone to                                 expect to find the project model in this                                 directory in fact in the end I also                                 passed the compiler so that it looks in                                 this directory by default this all means                                 that foreign aid our beta program it                                 becomes extremely easy to discover the                                 libraries and isotope and to use them                                 and their problems in contrast if you                                 don't have them yet and you are a made a                                 programmer and you'd like to use some                                 libraries then most of the time you have                                 to download them from source from their                                 upstream authors and then provide the                                 library for yourself discover any                                 incompatibilities between the libraries                                 and your other libraries and then                                 discover how to use this library in your                                 program it could be with the product                                 file or it could be with compiler                                 switching and since inside us but again                                 all of this hassle goes away in other                                 they will be point that you can use                                 directly                                 so this is a project fun                                 this is heartlessly the syntax is very                                 remiss in relations of a dot this is a                                 project file that describes a program                                 test GDK it's actually provided with gtk                                 ada in this product you specify where                                 the sources are for your object files we                                 go this is a factory where your                                 executable file to go you say what is                                 the main program actually in data your                                 main program the program naturally the                                 sub program that starts the program                                 doesn't happen domain can become                                 anything so in the project file is                                 specified the name of this is a program                                 which is to my net record then is a                                 package provider in which you can                                 provide some compiler switches in this                                 line i only provide the for switches                                 these all the switches are applied to                                 all the source files in addition to this                                 optionally you can have special switches                                 for just one point for example and the                                 main the main line of this program is                                 actually the first of all with gtk                                 attitude and GPO is quite magic because                                 when it sees this line the compiler will                                 know where to look for this GPR file                                 which is provided by the development                                 package it will then read this file and                                 know where to look for the sources of                                 the library so as to check for the                                 that every time you call the library you                                 are complying to that in affirmative                                 reply and stuff it will also know where                                 to look for the shared library and to                                 automatically link your executable                                 program with the shared library this is                                 all transparent to the to the program                                 now I'm reaching the technical parts of                                 the presentation which relaxed I was a                                 bit more time off here is an excerpt of                                 the ISO standards for the alien language                                 it says basically that                                 when the compiler emits an executable                                 file an executable program the invest                                 magazine that the entire executive order                                 is up-to-date with respect to all of the                                 sources the complete closure of all the                                 sources if you change what source file                                 then the compilers must discover that                                 you change the source file recompile the                                 relevant compilation units and then                                 reconcile any other compilation units                                 that depend on it that's what I meant                                 when I said that the language the other                                 language includes proper support for                                 several compilation if you are an ADA                                 programmer you almost never need                                 make-believe projects files because                                 Meghan is included in the compiler                                 but it has an implication for packaging                                 because it means that if you updates a                                 package containing the library then the                                 language rules say that all executables                                 that depend on this library are now out                                 of date and must be recompile                                 others develop it later for now let me                                 explain how the mass implements this                                 language requirement for consistency                                 what it does is that over every time it                                 compiles a units a source file it emits                                 an object file but it also emits an                                 either library information file a                                 airline which is it written in stripes                                 and this text file contains the check                                 cells I think the crc                                                  the checksums of a source file                                 corresponding to these units and the                                 checksum is calculated over the source                                 file excluding the whitespace and the                                 comments so if you just change comments                                 in your source files does not invalidate                                 it also contains references to all other                                 eagle-eye files that is to all the                                 compilation units that usually depends                                 on and this is how ada and the compiler                                 is able to provide you with full                                 crawford cross references between all                                 your

your ada program then your needs the                                 sources of the library for the syntactic                                 level and you need the airline files of                                 the library so that the compiler can                                 determine whether or not your sources                                 are up-to-date with respect to the                                 library that's why all the developments                                 packages in Debian provide the ami files                                 read only in this standard director

                         happen because of the language rules                                 suppose you have two libraries on the                                 defendant another and the program

                                is in the library that you forgot your                                 things but most of the people will say                                 others I already have the latest version                                 of Java packages so what's happening is                                 it a bug in the food now it's not                                 is it a bug in the bar no it's not                                 is it a burgundy no it's not it's simply                                 that the food library must be recompiled                                 our language rules so we want to avoid                                 this to avoid this we have to understand                                 that the Li files creates a very strong                                 dependency and the source level there                                 represents what sources want version of                                 the sources defend one from other                                 versions of the sources and we have to                                 capture this dependency information                                 directly in the package system of                                 distribution which means in the Debian                                 packages so we have to somehow reflect                                 they strong dependencies between                                 packages                                 so we considered another promotion to do                                 this                                 one was to say the package P never                                 depends on some precise versions of the                                 other libraries but this will quickly                                 realize that this donor parties for one                                 thing is not maintainable and for                                 another thing in Debian we have worked                                 with all binary non maintainer of loads                                 in avenues which means that anybody can                                 send an email to the administrator                                 saying oh please                                 recompile this library usually they do                                 this with the C libraries because some                                 include file has changed and then you                                 can become file because it changes                                 behavior isn't something that this                                 actually never happens we made that                                 because of the consistency rule but we                                 must still be compatible with the                                 avenues because that's the end policy so                                 we have two good reasons why this first                                 dimension is not viable so we will                                 divide the second solution which means                                 consists in adding an arbitrary number                                 in the name of the package this number                                 we call the ami version                                 it is quite similar to the Excel version                                 of chef libraries but it doesn't change                                 from the API changes it changes when                                 prepare life to change now with this                                 solution and example it becomes                                 impossible for a programmer to forget                                 the precise version of the development                                 package and depend on pickles simply no                                 option they must provide this number                                 because that's the name of the package                                 so we cannot forget to add the proper                                 dependency information and the                                 dependency information can then have                                 become wrong question yes Hey install                                 multiple nipples man slip two one two                                 three                                 at the same time this is up to the                                 person who provides the packages so in                                 theory yes but in practice we don't have                                 an an instance of that because we simply                                 don't have the manpower we provide to                                 support several versions of a lot                                 but it's excusable in theory this really                                 depends on the library                                 now with all this the consequence there                                 I believe is that Libya is now today the                                 best you can get if you're Canada for                                 this watch because it has long-term                                 support by the finishing pay that                                 programmers tend to like that because                                 it's a binary distribution so you don't                                 have to recompile everything it's                                 already done for you on multiple                                 architectures you get a wide choice of                                 libraries you know that Alton ivories                                 will be compatible with one another for                                 the binary level and in the source table                                 you have lots of vision specific patches                                 and make everything just works this                                 includes not only the libraries that I                                 mentioned earlier that are built from                                 the sources of GCC also includes values                                 minor adjustments to some libraries of                                 the GPS things like that the fact that                                 the compiler will look at a standard                                 place for project files                                 you know everything is done to take the                                 hassle out of discovering libraries and                                 using the reason                                 there's a new many mister since                                          busted since last year hopefully invader                                 at least stop the under port which is                                 where everyone interested gathers the                                 other place if you're interested in data                                 is of course music from Japan the data                                 which is not specifically well and all                                 these characteristics make them very                                 attractive to people who simply want to                                 write software in Ada and make it work                                 like I said the competition is finally                                 catching up which means that there are                                 some other distributions that are now                                 starting to also provide with operator                                 and I'm going to talk about many I'll                                 just give this                                 so gently I'm not the gentle developer                                 so what I'm going to say now might be a                                 little bit wrong but I try to read about                                 what's gentle provides a lesson and it                                 seems to be the exact opposite of what                                 the end of which is good because it                                 means that another set of people might                                 be interested in gentle and this set how                                 basically the hackers why because gentle                                 there's a sauce based distribution it                                 helps you become part of the world                                 because it thinks that recompiling the                                 world is good so if you like to                                 recompile everything use gentle another                                 consequence of this is that they provide                                 you with a choice of compilers we have                                 both the GPL editions and non GPL                                 engines that allow you to write for free                                 very softly so you get a choice and then                                 you can recombine everything with your                                 chosen compiler it also has a nice wide                                 choice of libraries to choose from so                                 this is also a distribution that                                 provides very good support for a natural                                 grammars except you have to recompile                                 everything and you                                 know that some labor reason don't                                 necessarily made compatible with all the                                 libraries                                 in freebsd not then can you take                                 previously because taking dilute a                                 previously used onion                                 so I've already comments those resisting                                 supports in the most lights so if you                                 have to use pure fiercely if your                                 freebsd then currently the supports for                                 Hydra is very bad I think we have one                                 outdated version of a compiler and                                 that's basically it                                 but there's one guy generator who has                                 started work on this you seem to be very                                 competent and dedicated and in contact                                 with a lollipop he passed the GCC to                                 introduced support for FreeBSD in the                                 compiler because this will office                                 absence is going to send these patches                                 of string very soon now because GCC                                     is in deep freeze when DVDs from                                 students and we give the extra bonus it                                 will become possible to send patches for                                 the next version and now he already has                                 the stockings of three the packages in                                 the previously                                 Wall Street so what's this fence if you                                 are a previously developer interested in                                 a de cities are moving in the right                                 direction similarly from that's peony                                 and dragonfly gearsley the same guy Joe                                 Moreno has also done a lot of work on                                 these two platforms and he actually                                 works pretty indignities in five years                                 in parallel and his policies to approach                                 his new packages all three of them                                 simultaneously for now he only supports                                 by                                                                     so no nips no spark currently but it                                 will might come in the future is now                                 working and again ask for Android one in                                 fact is going to provide them from fire                                 devices                                 they don't other distributions this is                                 basically a long project in Seoul Sports                                 was a small group of people I think you                                 know five or six people have since                                 several years knowledge provide RPM                                 packages mostly off the end and also                                 some packages for salaries and some for                                 Mac os                                   so if you are on Pandora or Souza                                 then this is what you should go to the                                 socials project if you want to get                                 binary packages I think they have the                                 compiler the country TK ADA they have a                                 few of the libraries like that but it's                                 nowhere near is completely                                 the last video or creator and we drink                                 that question times for sure                                 no I think what you do what you prepared                                 for your speech I can take with me is                                 there any questions prepared shopping a                                 live version thing that's fine if you do                                 all the packaging and within VPN but now                                 if I put my own other potentially if I                                 get some other program from other                                 country because I'm running in a pretty                                 much affects how if my perkiness contra                                 depend on a live version one and foreign                                 packages of programs defend on a live                                 version cool you should be free and                                 that's basically the reason why the the                                 distribution from a that for example                                 they they also have a large selection of                                 libraries goes away the core but they                                 are only is also no binary this this is                                 how they avoid right there because then                                 the compiler takes care of the                                 investment which means that you have to                                 recompile everything that is                                 gently swipe that's right that's right                                 because if you think that the                                 recompiling is doing the engine to its                                 writing of course but let me tell you                                 that science combined yes                                 any plans to sell the m                                                  every asset that's an interesting Olivia                                 there's one guy who started porting the                                 JCC the ADA from of GCC to the back end                                 of feather here he actually got                                 something working with the front end of                                 GCC v                                                                 but is possible now to write beta                                 programs using an of the end well                                 supported                                 well it's not supported that's a problem                                 because just one guy who did this in his                                 spare time and it's not yet packaged as                                 far as I know in any distribution so                                 it's quite experimental                                 but if you're interested in the                                 atmosphere welcome to contributes and                                 I'll be very happy to visit Damian in                                 the future                                 any other questions                                 okay                                 thank you so I'm going to do an example                                 of an other package that comes from my                                 love of the University but we want to                                 come to this is we have a single                                 absolute thermal and we're going to have                                 our own little sister which is this                                 abuse not Gnostic it could be runnable                                 to any distribution and then out of it                                 we're going to break the signal source                                  packets for Damien and the source                                  package will deal for marriages one                                  which is a library with all the                                  experience development army back and the                                  other one which are the executables just                                  so we know what we are talking about                                  mass isn't software that we use in our                                  lab to do some real-time analysis Miska                                  beauty and extinction there is sometimes                                  gee there's etc for what it matters a                                  package in three days under GPL v                                         can package jesus said the volvo file                                  area and it uses two external libraries                                  jdk area and it's male data provenance                                  is the original upstream of stream TV                                  system is not suitable for packaging                                  because it doesn't today's is of the                                  vandalism in a centralized place                                  so how we see it is easily valid it has                                  an internal general-purpose library that                                  it might be used by different programs                                  so I have decided to create a library                                  package out of it there are a lot of                                  common a a common sources that are used                                  repeatedly in all the executables we                                  could create an aesthetic library with                                  then puppy doesn't make sense because we                                  are not going to install it and so I                                  just reuse them in the internet a                                  compilation that the nice thing about                                  nganimate is now we're not going to                                  compile them again and then we have                                  finally say five projects that give some                                  executables are those impacts but                                  trackage together as must                                  so first of all we want to talk about                                  the GPR building system as told us we                                  don't use big fights at the general army                                  to build a gate that problems because in                                  a place takes care of dependencies                                  automatically and it follows the other                                  compilation model however we give some                                  some facts to drive house genetics works                                  to specify in which their injuries we                                  want to like the binaries or to take                                  their sources from some specific                                  switches such as the path optimisation                                  etc so they did not make the trip here                                  files is intelligent enough to do all                                  the or the heart above Regional Library                                  ways they switched their so name etc I                                  will just make our our make file would                                  be a routes the game books would be a                                  script excuse of garage maybe I have                                  done the here the dynamic compilation of                                  a specific path                                  because the dependency system would                                  recreate that irony and so what we need                                  is one file from the library one GPR                                  file once you put your fight for the                                  share code and then an individual GPR                                  file for the individual projects I'm                                  going to show an example of each so this                                  is the library GPR file it has some                                  information about the library the name                                  the SL version whether it is going to be                                  built as statically or dynamically since                                  we're going to build both for the                                  package we have used external the switch                                  mechanism that we just use the same file                                  twice once for dynamic on another forest                                  and then here we specify were replaced                                  by the building system and then these                                  are the directories the EBU directories                                  a source the intermediate directory is                                  the objective these are this is were                                  there any files here which are used to                                  track all dependencies will be graced                                  and exporting then we can                                  and switches with the average this is a                                  descendants we can do switch for the                                  compiler for the leader for divine                                  different different tools that it                                  induces now so here we just say develop                                  this is the cup of one the common one                                  doesn't generate a library it                                  Imagineering and executable neither but                                  it says where it gets in sources and                                  what it will place these objects so                                  there and again the switches by the way                                  the switches are that we use here are                                  typically Jesus Uranus so you don't need                                  to know the specific things about Allah                                  to the optimization to do debugging as                                  you can see the gddr                                                   hassle of operating debian same exact                                  room for for example the be useful                                  library we                                  the facility we are filing                                  here we use not include that's one                                  because of ADA in C when you include                                  something you just blindly copies so you                                  have any use everything                                  he later we use a package or soup                                  project aside                                  we use it when we want so it's it's like                                  a resource immediately at that moment we                                  take it and then we have the the main                                  the main file is listed here so we that                                  have different months then directories                                  and the switches                                  so this gives the resulting have chosen                                  have chosen to to do everything together                                  under revealed so they clean would be                                  much easier                                  you have object directories for the                                  library in its dynamic and static forms                                  and for the different projects we have                                  one thing that there are some common                                  file names here and here since they are                                  in different directories with their own                                  eglee files that doesn't create a                                  problem that's not a problem if we                                  wanted to put them together in the                                  object there will be some conflicts so                                  that's why I chose three separate                                  directories these are the exported alien                                  files that will be used for dependency                                  when we leaned against the library                                  the lettering server and experiments                                  it's important to note also that we                                  typically have two files from a started                                  one here the one which is the file it                                  has the same name as a surname and then                                  we would say that to use it to link                                  against we will trade a typical symbolic                                  link a normal libraries in YouTube in                                  Linux if I define free virus then file                                  itself simply with that so                                  and singing with a development day in                                  Asia and we don't we don't need that                                  because as soon as the final changes to                                  the biggest plane we need to generate                                  another one so we only use one one five                                  to the seventh inning                                  we need another senior that you be                                  refined which is a one that would be                                  installed once whatever is installed so                                  it has it is generic in the sense that                                  we don't know where you install it so                                  put the prefix the objective because                                  we're not going to use it it is                                  important that it has an experiment this                                  is used to a do prevents from the from                                  the user to automatically reveal the                                  library so happens if we change the one                                  source file and we talk recompile it                                  then agree I will be elated and we try                                  to build a project with this library                                  there in animation with us for the                                  library we will compile it since we are                                  not groups we cannot change it so the                                  choice is to prevent it they cannot make                                  it will give it will report variables                                  but will report they work on day for the                                  package that needs to                                  they do the language so we know where                                  what is going on so that's all allows                                  building when I'm talking I don't                                  announce the bill if you want                                  it is                                  so                                  as you can see already hope you can see                                  some                                  well we are really in a state editor                                  balladeer some files required from other                                  files on the man master analysis maybe                                  so the building starts from the top                                  topmost main file and as soon as a                                  capability unit is needed in a me we go                                  through the different directors specify                                  the veggie PR files to find                                  okay                                  so once we have the building who needs                                  to do the installation and here we're                                  going to follow the data policy general                                  hey with concerns the level package                                  there's every development package which                                  is used to develop opinions with the                                  layer under a package the rendering                                  package we go would be the unified and                                  today this that's deep is important if                                  you make a make file to owner the                                  density of article that will be doesn't                                  make that easier for Debian packages and                                  eventually at the end which is from                                  every config to update they every get                                  any cash like any chef library for                                  library development package is                                  impossible as an anomaly but that                                  ability to do things which are not                                  common in destiny see libraries first of                                  all copy the ugly files and put them fit                                  only in a destination that have chosen                                  library this allows they cannot make to                                  find the other files because they will                                  be declared in the exported GTR files                                  have a centralized place to replace them                                  you also need to copy the alias files                                  which splay the rogue as they of H files                                  in C but since some libraries use use                                  D&E recommendations massive templates                                  may be some other ATV files will be                                  needed as well so in simplification we                                  copy all of them ABS nav files again we                                  never define the vectoring                                  which depends on the letter and then                                  there's for the GBR fight so this is how                                  it is done a to make fun for example we                                  got the directories we copy the the                                  dynamic library and then will you                                  suggest this to like variable or                                  simplicity they do another leap between                                  the leaves and then we will copy the                                  general and exported GPR file which is                                  generally put in the traffic itself will                                  do the read only will start the day in                                  the smatv files other goods the                                  different the archives                                  so this is also generally public do we                                  use a library you can see there is a                                  policy for that the preferred way is to                                  create a table GPR file like little bit                                  an example that we have a given curve                                  shown if you see some not loosening                                  there are some switches in a minute to                                  to make him find that in India's and                                  there in any hi files are you need to                                  specifically link against the library or                                  you can use in front of America's so                                  summarizing again for every library we                                  need one internal GPR file which will be                                  used to lift the library and eventually                                  all the packages or than other files                                  that are included in the same package                                  we need one export it GPR file which                                  will be installed after the                                  collaboration stuff and installation                                  with puppy the library is statically                                  design dynamic the size allows medical                                  fee for each if you want to create a                                  project that uses that library for a GDR                                  file and installation displace them in                                  the past investigation                                  okay now I'm going to enter in a typical                                  Vivian packaging I'm not an expert in                                  packaging very ingenious but have done                                  some things so I'm here with some files                                  for a basic example who makes that look                                  the edge made if you want that great                                  Zygerrian a person's and then we don't                                  do that if they're in one stroke this is                                  the source important you need to depend                                  on the government's giving to use and                                  then this is the control file for the                                  main packages automatically as its                                  little tents mixer parents                                  so that's movie special what the you can                                  sit recipes for the library the library                                  has three packages the library the                                  development and the debug this is                                  generated automatically and have serves                                  in the case in which diversity to that                                  means that for some reason I have to                                  recompile ivory I might take the same                                  idea so the so name does not change a I                                  have                                  diversion fertilizer in that with that                                  route may prevent a user for recompiling                                  and project so in the policy Monday's is                                  to eat to interest to will this food and                                  I we haven't the name daily life to the                                  name of the library how he puts                                  conflicts against the previous version                                  of the library so whenever you install a                                  library the other one will be removed                                  and since the name is different you will                                  have to also change any any package that                                  depends on it so it's a way to say okay                                  here's the problem you need to change                                  that but at least you know where you                                  have to do it then that makes five and I                                  am based on the upstream made further                                  that I showed so everything to to                                  compile it reduces to do these kind of                                  things that that was addressed                                  separately so even inert and then the                                  diggin files a new defender can give                                  everything to the edge general detergent                                  we authorize some compress because it                                  includes some radius or                                               your documentation like maybe you see BB                                  or the ancient examples it should be                                  pseudonym                                  compressed it is an extension that that                                  hundred lesson dog gets quite well a                                  this is a typical maneuver to generate a                                  tobacco package yeah                                  so you want to go private show                                  it would be so for these the water                                  release that is done the links some                                  files her packets and we're going to                                  build this is again the installation                                  procedure                                  nothing specific there                                  and that's all you are then talking the                                  build                                  nice finish a little anesthesiology one                                  okay any questions                                  we deliver wo for myself                                  well                                  eh                                  okay this leader okay                                  in seven flexpay                                  maybe                                  yes I can start the package                                  the message looks like he's                                  demodex yeah                                  absolutely sight what                                  if the next speaker wants to come up to                                  Beverly                                  Thank You lieutenant                                  okay and then we can vanish                                  they                                  yeah not                                  and then once they've arrived                                  detective bill package that should be                                  BSE in with ya space - NC space - in                                  similar and Nick Oh Charlie you gotta be                                  okay                                  that's that's starting it nautically                                  okay and only built the pilot package                                  okay the sauce package I should work                                  no they say nice touch
