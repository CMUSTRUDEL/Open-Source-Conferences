Description: 
	Software packages are steadily increasing in size (lines of code) and many tools do not take advantage of the multi-core paradigm and still only compile on one core. This has the effect that a huge increase in compilation time is taking place. Some packages depend on other packages which have to be built beforehand. The easy and time/resource consuming method is to build all packages in a continuous loop and skip failures till everything is finished or do it by hand. The better method is to build the packages in the correct order from the start in only one pass. This implies some analysis beforehand to construct this order. In the talk a tool will be described that does exactly this for rpm packages. After the build order is defined the actual build can take place. On the Operating System level this can include hundreds of rpm and take a very long time. (Days is not unusual) To shorten this, the build process can be separated on numerous machines.
