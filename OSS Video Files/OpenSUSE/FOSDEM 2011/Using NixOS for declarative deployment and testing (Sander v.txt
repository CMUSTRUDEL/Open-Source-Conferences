Title: Using NixOS for declarative deployment and testing (Sander v
Publication date: 2011-02-05
Playlist: FOSDEM 2011
Description: 
	NixOS is a Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager, a purely functional package manager. In NixOS, a system configuration is built from a declarative specification capturing the complete system configuration. Moreover, because of the Nix heritage, a user can safely and efficiently install multiple configurations next to each other without interference. This allows users to perform atomic upgrades and rollbacks of a complete Linux distribution.In this talk we explain how we can use NixOS to manage a network of machines by using a declarative specification of a network of NixOS configurations.

	                              that's right now so I'm some little girl                               I'm a PhD student also an active                               contributor for the next OS project                               which is a particular linux distribution                               using a package manager called nix on                               this presentation I I'm not going to                               explain the genome I live Nexus but the                               particular useful application takes of                               us which you can use for declarative                                deployment and testing so that you may                                know there are many kinds of linux                                distributions available like the famous                                ones like italians the door are going to                                azusa all those distributions have some                                similar goals but also in their own                                goals and also some technical                                differences like the biggest manager                                which is being used so when sister                                fedora package manager fedora I uses the                                RPM package manager DeLeon is so nice                                Beckett managers like various and shell                                script also the goals typically                                different like the detailed linux                                distributions it's developed for systems                                with a small disk space of footprint                                leave of course also have an ex OS and                                that's when I'm going to tell you about                                in this top                                so this presentation is also about                                software deployment and you have to                                avoid misconceptions this is the meaning                                of what's already pointed me so that's                                basically all the activities that make                                and solar system available for use                                that's well typically for mini Chief                                Justice is installing a your favorite                                Linux institution with the package                                packages that you want you may also need                                to adapt or take some configuration                                files like if you want to run web server                                you have to modify your Apache                                configuration maybe you need to install                                some custom pieces of software like                                you're getting your favorite games you                                may also need to upgrade a system which                                in some cases could take quite some                                effort                                the deployment process also are also                                performed in various scenarios so in                                most cases you just installed a single                                machine just your workstation or a                                laptop or maybe your mobile device so                                that's basically installing your                                distribution your desktop your favorite                                end user applications and maybe use the                                Twitter some conference buzz the                                deployment is also typically done in                                this industry in large distributed                                environments like data centers so in                                data centers maybe of knowledge of                                machines available which must be managed                                simultaneously and also machines are                                connected and also may be dependent on                                each other so for instance if you're                                hosting some kind of verification                                cluster maybe some web service is                                connected to a database server or an                                application service or load balancers                                which it's dependent and Chuck's                                environments are even harder to manage                                them a single installations and                                deployment also happens in virtual                                environments so so in case you want to                                try out some new linux dissolution or                                maybe a packets that prefer your system                                yeah we refer we want to use fertile                                machines because they basically presents                                that your host systems being messed up                                and                                installing                                                           effort                                so as you may know deployments of                                loosing machines already a very tough                                process it takes some time to figure                                your Linux distributions is all the                                packages that you want to know the                                configuration files and upgrading is                                even dangerous some cases so for                                instance if you update some critical                                problems on your system and in the                                middle of your system crashes then it's                                still the question whether your system                                is still rootable after that deploying                                distributed environments even harder                                because machines are interconnected with                                each other and have dependencies on each                                other something breaks that maybe you're                                all web application environment breaks                                and you're basically not able to do                                 the things that you want with your web                                 applications so for instance with a                                 website like Adam it's basically very                                 very youths program and also if you want                                 to update and distributed environment in                                 many cases large sometimes made up here                                 so maybe you have to shut down certain                                 services maybe some dependencies and                                 while you're upgrading maybe your web                                 application environment isn't working                                 properly anymore and the deployment of                                 virtual machines is equally hard so                                 except that you don't have to manage                                 your own art fair you still need to                                 install those certain machines with the                                 right packages and the right                                 configuration files and because                                 installing virtual machines is also very                                 tough process people usually don't                                 perform system integration tests                                 frequently because so much work to do                                 and some so in many cases people say                                 it's the testing work for the end                                 instead of doing it well they are                                 developing a particular system                                 so in this talk I will talk about links                                 of us and you know mix of us we can deal                                 with those issues and yeah the services                                 this is linux distribution using the                                 next person it's assumed its distinct                                 features compared to regular packets                                 much like RPM or the value package                                 manager so the main idea of the next                                 package managers that we store all                                 packages in isolation from each other                                 and we can do this because every package                                 has a unique file name in so-called next                                 or so in this light princess we have the                                 Firefox package which has a very strange                                 bath night and then so the first part in                                 the bath i use and hashcode and that                                 hash code is to write from all the time                                 dependence is used to build that                                 particular component and those those                                 diamond tennessee's are all the source                                 itself but also some libraries that are                                 being used also compiler and build                                 scripts and so on so for instance if i                                 would compile firefox within different                                 version of GCC i will also get a                                 different hash code and because i had                                 different hash cover than a unique file                                 name i can safely store multiple                                 variants the same components next to                                 each other without interference and in                                 regular linux distributions like rpn you                                 can do this very easily so then                                 university                                 give them strength parameter to you                                 configure space in order to be sure that                                 as your new variant is stored somewhere                                 else and the expected many dozen                                 formulism Google it's for you so in the                                 next fixed package manager usenix                                 expressions we have our own purely                                 functional language which you can use to                                 describe how the packages are built from                                 source code in this slides I have an                                 example showing expression for real                                 openssh secure shell sir so basically                                 what we do in this expression is so                                 essentially this this expression is a                                 function so some baseline over us                                 basically the function header with steak                                 some arguments so in this case these are                                 built I'm dependencies so we were to                                 build openssh unit the openssl library                                 visit with lycra compression and we re                                 also have two special components so in                                 the body because make derivation                                 function which means that we well that's                                 basically the next way of saying we want                                 to build something from source code and                                 there is a simple attribute wits ends of                                 the unique store                                 we used to fetch URL argument to Devil's                                 the openness is eight source goes from                                 some location for the web and finally we                                 provide some build instructions which                                 subscribe how to build                                 openssh from source code okay so this                                 expression days he says okay this is my                                 recipe to build a component but we still                                 cannot use this expression directly to                                 perform the action world that's because                                 we still have to provide you those                                 function arguments so that we know which                                 version of organizes all we want to use                                 of its version separately one to use and                                 that's basically figuring this                                 expression next slide so in this                                 expression and so here we make a                                 function call to the expression i showed                                 in the previous slide so here we go on                                 the open as a sec eight built function                                 with the right function arguments like                                 open as i said holmes at it and as you                                 can see also all the other dependencies                                 like openssl itself is also composed in                                 this expression and also refers to some                                 mix expression which builds openssl from                                 surf hood and also all the other                                 dependencies all up to gmt are defined                                 in this model and this can use that                                 mobile to build a package so for                                 instance by executing implement like                                 this next end                                 as you can install a particular package                                 so if you learn the online instruction                                 year that it will install openssh a new                                 user environment and because we use an                                 expected which manager to build this                                 also be open as aids builder is stored                                 in the next door and also has a Nash                                 tote in it's fattening the right from                                 all the bills time bends is likely open                                 itself air into choosing disaster for                                 misusing that's why you know we can say                                 safely install and stored move of                                 experience in next to each other they                                 use them without any danger so Nick so                                 as you're basically you complete system                                 is magnified in the expecting package                                 manager so also the Venus kernel and                                 also configuration files like you're a                                 passive observer conspiration this your                                 shelf inspiration are managed in the                                 next door so they all the Nash code or                                 stored safely isolation to each other                                 and because we store everything in the                                 next door we don't have direct is such                                 as Leslie pen / user which you usually                                 fountain regularly means destinations                                 like Lauren                                 mixers only as a minimalist lesbian                                  at sea level directory so in the                                 screenshot for instance you see that the                                 /bin directory contains a symlink got                                 essays it is ascending to the bash shell                                 and well basically we need a shell in                                 that location because the system                                 function in GFC requires but that's the                                 only reason why the athens else immune                                 to such pain for the rest of South Bend                                 directories entirely empty and it's less                                 etsy we need to store some share                                 confidential files like Etsy host and                                 that's he bachelor files for Eureka but                                 that's basically it you don't have to                                 store your bicycle apache web server                                 corporations less etsy it's all being                                 stored to neutral well i think that this                                 both sound so surprising to you but                                 everything starting the next door but                                 mixer is more than just a distribution                                 losing the next packetsmen so in next                                 semester I deism is that instead of                                 manually                                 installing packages manually editing                                 configuration files you basically build                                 your system from a single configuration                                 file for the declarative specification                                 so in this slide in this vegetable                                 creation i'm using now from my level I                                 left some useless options out and in                                 this model I also captured properties                                 like the direct fire and the group you                                 slice that that's used also some file                                 systems and things like the root                                 petition the SWAT petitioned also                                 subsisting services like I want to bring                                 secure shell surfing I want to use an X                                 server in this case the xserve is                                 pre-configured to boot into ke for but                                 you can also use different minimalistic                                 right and i also want to use some user                                 software so for instance I've them to                                 firefox web browser and the midnight                                 poem and favorable fuse and by using a                                 specification like this and running the                                 Knicks of us rebuild command with                                 xls install tonight you can build a                                 complete configuration from single                                 declared specification as shown in                                 previous slide so so next we'll then                                 build all the packages also the                                 configuration files and also stores them                                 in the next door with hash code so                                 better w interfere with each other and                                 that's why upgrades are also almost                                 atomic on the on deck so there are no                                 files being overwritten during the day                                 or remove so I can also have aspects of                                 any configuration I have built                                 previously some nicks you don't we move                                 packages Natalie but you use some kind                                 of garbage collector which besides                                 weather package is still in use on what                                 and then it will safely remove                                 everything so this is the bootloader the                                 mix our juices and as you can see except                                 for the default configuration you can                                 also take any previous configuration                                 that you have built before and you can                                 instantly boot into the previous                                 configuration that's not good garbage                                 collected yet and you can also switch at                                 random by the way                                 it's all different kernel some well in                                 this case it's the same kernel version                                 that's been also switch between                                 different girl but the kernel itself is                                 it separate well the Colonel's also                                 stored like ordinary packages next door                                 with some hash code its use the                                 sustainment basically that's why you can                                 also save these weights between various                                 currents it's also possible so well next                                 OS has some good deployment properties                                 for single systems so it's interesting                                 to see you whether we can we can expand                                 these these mechanisms distributed                                 systems because in many cases like                                 verification cognitive and for network                                 of machines to medicines that is just                                 seems so as a motivating example I will                                 use the track so some of you may know                                 track it's basically a web-based                                 management system for the Soviet project                                 so so it's Rex you have access to your                                 subversion repository you can also                                 define tickets books and so on                                 the track it can be deployed in                                 distributed environments our for                                 instance you can have a separate                                 subversion server separate database                                 server a separate web server which can                                 be connected to each other so in this                                 case you may want to deploy a track on                                 three separate machine since that single                                 machine and with the nixa West you can                                 also capture a network of neck service                                 conference dealing with this so in this                                 life I shall particular example                                 representing the track example so                                 essentially the the four-month of this                                 configuration file is the same as                                 ordinary nixle s information except that                                 I used various attributes it's                                 specifying a particular target in the                                 network so actually so here is three                                 separate Nick service both creations one                                 for a storage server storage version                                 evil spirits one for postgresql database                                 and one for web server which provides                                 access to end users                                 with the next OST boy network from                                 online instruction you can also deploy a                                 network of machines from just one single                                 specification capturing the Denver                                 machines and their properties so                                 basically the Nexus deployed commander                                 does is it will first try to build all                                 system perforations by the next package                                 manager again it will use the hashing                                 trick to prevent that files interfere                                 with each other so you can safely store                                 all the the the configurations in the                                 host next door next to each other after                                 all configurations are built and then                                 they are transferred to our target                                 machines in a network and this is                                 usually very efficient process so if                                 some particular component within hash                                 code already exists on the target                                 machine we don't have to copy it again                                 because we know of the icing shape that                                 the if combined with that particular                                 aspect already exists we don't have to                                 transfer it anymore because exactly the                                 same and it's also safe process so                                 because we store everything in isolation                                 in next over while upgrading the                                 existing configuration is not affected                                 so if my machine would crash during the                                 upgrade the configuration is still is                                 exactly what you                                 the status of some clouds that are being                                 overwritten terrific and after all the                                 components are transferred then we have                                 to activate the configuration they'll so                                 basically if AB apps are installed then                                 we have to activate the web server also                                 the database server and in this phase                                 failures from no cure but this time he                                 knows as short as possible and so its                                 failure cures then we have to do roll                                 back roll back is usually very cheap                                 operation because you're both confession                                 is still stored in next door so that we                                 can switch back to any configuration                                 almost instantly yeah so you can use a                                 network specification to deploy physical                                 machines but we also have extended Nexus                                 to use the same specification for an                                 employment of network of virtual                                 machines so if you use the Knicks OS                                 build VMS come online instruction                                 instead of next OS deploying network                                 then a network of team of virtual                                 machines is generated which you can                                 launch by executing script in the result                                 another nice thing about this to point                                 out is that we don't create disk images                                 for the                                 screw machines instead we mount the next                                 door of the host system because                                 basically all the configurations are                                 already on the next door and we use the                                 hashing scheme to store everything in                                 isolation from each other so why do you                                 have a copy everything again but you can                                 access them from by network file system                                 on your system and                                 so yeah penance is what I already cool                                 if you compare this approach to regular                                 distributions in which you notice the                                 next door using hash codes to isolate                                 components this is very hard to do so                                 you can just mount your hosts file                                 system and access those components                                 because they may differ from each other                                 and you're not sure whether a particular                                 live event on your whole system is                                 suitable to random on your particular                                 cash machine                                 so here I have screenshots showing the                                 track example so here I choose the                                 network model I showed earlier to                                 generate the network of four virtual                                 machines so I also include the clients                                 first machine running of errands for                                 convenience and I opened the anti-base                                 with a particular project you can employ                                 a virtual network like this by a single                                 mode specifying single expression and                                 using a single command lines in bed but                                 then the last feature is testing so so                                 let's say you have a network prefer to                                 machines why shouldn't you use it for                                 other men performing automatic test                                 cases so it makes a mess we have                                 implemented a test driver which you can                                 use to write the test cases America unit                                 tests with them forever and never prefer                                 to machines so in this particular                                 example I                                 do various things so basically we                                 created closer to the postgresql                                 database for a particular second                                 fireman's one he also gets a vertical                                 story add another check project and then                                 finally the launch in accession also                                 launched a conqueror web browser to see                                 whether the mg Bates is accessible and                                 finally we also take a screenshot and                                 basically you can execute test cases                                 like this with mix package manager so so                                 in this case we launched the network of                                 fruit machines in an own interactive map                                 so some no windows are appearing on your                                 screen that's just text that's it it                                 will execute everything described in the                                 test fee and see better office cases                                 succeed                                 so the distributed deployment and                                 testing for you to three ethnic lighters                                 to several use cases so we have them                                 complete list of machines available in                                 our network at the university between us                                 Marston expenditures we manage those                                 network machines by a single expression                                 and one from online instruction                                 basically we also use the testing                                 approach for various projects for                                 instance for continuous integration and                                 testing of Nick service so each time a                                 contributor changes something in our                                 super seen you post story basically some                                 test cases are automatically you know                                 started like the next OS installer so we                                 have particular in this test case we                                 okay                                 to first machines one is a client which                                 the solutions installed another                                    machine is a server hosting some                                 packages and we see whether the                                 installation succeed and also the track                                 example cases include which I described                                 in this presentation and we also have a                                 very simple secure shell test case                                 that's basically just a test case                                 launching a servant client and check                                 whether connection can be established we                                 also use the testing approach for                                 continuous integration and testing of                                 various group projects so one of the                                 interesting things we do is we build a                                 complete mix our system with a bleeding                                 at seal obscene so every time a new new                                 branch has been made in the in Maine                                 Maine upstream GFC repository we do noon                                 xls instance run some test cases to see                                 whether till you've seen behaves softly                                 and I've you have some other free                                 software project experiments of bringing                                 as well                                 so so we're not the only ones doing                                 system configuration management so                                 examples of other approaches are see if                                 engine stores package manager but the                                 main difference if i compare our                                 oppressed and their approach the main                                 Jason system is that they use convergent                                 models so basically in see if engine you                                 can also describe some great actions but                                 they change the system embarrassing                                 themselves so that's basically some                                 files get overwritten or James and in                                 our products restore everything in the                                 next of nationalism international so we                                 doesn't overwrite and anything that's                                 once basically sets are broad support                                 from existing group okay then I'll come                                 to the                                 this presentation so in this                                 presentation I've shown mix of us itself                                 so that's basically the main exhibition                                 using a mix package manager which you                                 can use to deploy a complete system from                                 a single specification i also have shown                                 makes us deploy in network and that                                 basically expensing exercise protestant                                 message machine so you can efficiently                                 not reliably employer networking service                                 machines I've also shown xos build VMs                                 which you can use to build a network of                                 fruit machine in the same type of                                 specification and I've Sheldon exhaust                                 test driver which you can use to perform                                 test cases in generating virtual network                                 when I from Griffin did the references                                 as well so I need to assess a website                                 shown here so from the website you can                                 get various nicks related pieces of                                 software so so we have to make specs                                 manage itself of course also in its                                 packages which is a collection of three                                 thousands of the source packages which                                 you can automatically deploy it nice we                                 have linux OS the knicks based linux                                 distribution options for the also high                                 draft that's Nick's pace continues built                                 integration server pendulum basically                                 chooses next to perform several variants                                 of TCC like this and also stars                                 everything in the next two episodes for                                 continuous integration it's also very                                 useful these days and also this makes                                 and that's basically a nick extension to                                 the distributed service before me so                                 that's basically the same branch I share                                 with the assistance with a lower level                                 of criminality you can use all the                                 software under and free and of the                                 source licenses so the mix package                                 manager itself is cheap lgpl but the mix                                 packages collection and extras are x                                   license so you can basically Google                                                                     two other things I'd like to point out                                 this is that mix can be used on any                                 Linux system so you don't need to                                 install mix OS if you want to try it                                 next but you can also use it on your                                 favorite linux distribution but also                                 freebsd opensolaris door in the cygwin                                 also the virtualization features then                                 based on editing system using the next                                 package manager in K here so if you find                                 the testing process I've shown                                 interesting that you would still want to                                 use your favorite linux distribution you                                 can also download the next package                                 managers you used on faith and in linux                                 distribution use that to generate                                 virtual networks that's also possible ok                                 that's so far as the questions                                 okay are you doing to that user data                                 that is specific version of the service                                 or the program good constant if you are                                 grateful press to later bird the                                 database okay yeah that's a good                                 question so in the next we currently                                 don't have anything to do with mutable                                 state and in focus like databases so you                                 still have to manually update this                                 female                                 the actual file formats themselves in                                 order to match the new version of the                                 app some work in progress that's being                                 certainly those issues but it will still                                 take some time to get it finished you                                 have scripts now that you                                 so for databases friends is what we do                                 now is we basically store in the schema                                 or incident in the next door and the                                 database servers will activate a                                 particular scheme argent and started but                                 that basically do the way we do now with                                 beautiful cycle that's that this is not                                 entirely the way we wanted so we also                                 want to migrate state dynamically but                                 that still work to be done yeah I don't                                 quite get how you can run the mixed                                 beverage manager on any new system for                                 example if you installed on vegan here I                                 mean the next package manager will                                 completely over Joe everything on your                                 file system if you know it also uses the                                 Nick stores let's make / store it will                                 store all the packages there so nothing                                 on your host system get slope gets open                                 again                                 overwritten and also if you want to use                                 the practice stourton in next door you                                 you have to tweak your path environment                                 there are pointing to another directory                                 so basically next we have a sailing                                 three I've enjoyed in directly referring                                 to those components in the next door and                                 if you put that in your path then it                                 will use those packages but so when you                                 start your PC given process boots of                                 system entirely and then yeah yeah yeah                                 so you can also deploy a Firefox fell                                 under dating system using the next x-men                                 develop still using your negative x                                 window system of your diving system yeah                                 how do you do deal with scripts or                                 experience using absolute paths you mean                                 then they are referring to some                                 executable quite like typical foreign                                 fighters if that starts                                 yeah you are so damn those skirts so                                 next OS this gives you real-time arrows                                 so we have encountered some bad badly                                 designed packages between two to tweak                                 and that many in those cases but it                                 didn't occur that frequently so                                 basically other tools based off air and                                 usually work fine in next there are some                                 exceptions apply to you cut the rapper                                 script yeah for bison we created by a                                 prescription it's a certain bison are                                 you so it should take native to linux                                 executables basically a library bats is                                 somewhere in your heart off field in                                 that's our next finds libraries but for                                 languages like Python you don't have                                 anything to refer to certain we have to                                 wear basically random Python program and                                 specify the environment variables like                                 Python cloth to find red lightning's you                                 configuration pilots as well yeah he                                 does so so most configuration files are                                 in the next door with there are some                                 exceptions like Etsy password it's                                 basically containing all the user                                 accounts or Etsy hosts those files are                                 still being stored in / etsy because                                 there's no other way to do this purely                                 functional manner it was actually                                 sleeping more about the bonfire Miami                                 record those then others are many                                 spandex either so the US managed to                                 those users by yourself what a lot take                                 any seam facing a lot of interest do you                                 have anybody                                 action even though the test approach or                                 the just acceptable who makes less like                                 you know how do you see playing out                                 being either of the next six months a                                 year yeah this is good question so                                 curiously we don't have we don't have                                 many users yes actually so it yeah some                                 universities are using it and some small                                 companies that i know i added earth                                 anything of a lot of large companies                                 using that well it's time you've been                                 going on for over six years now and it's                                 growing every year yes it's a steady                                 growth it's not letting it stop the                                 exponential its linear okay what about                                 the there were some interest also from                                 other distributions last year was there                                 anything picked up all right yeah so we                                 have also been discussed in a day in                                 name miss but basically conclusion must                                 know and one of the other there are all                                 kinds of reasons they ask but so once                                 the main takes the Debian developers                                 complaint about us that we don't adhere                                 to the FHS standards so                                 at the zest a successful executable soup                                 in slash beta for booths and otherwise                                 its users has been lay on the other hand                                 severe complaint we but there you have                                 to violate that because if using                                 approach like that we can store anything                                 in isolation that's not funny so we                                 follow the fxs as much as possible but                                 in case like in the storing executables                                 and libraries we have to violate that                                 specification which because there's no                                 other way to do things we want yeah and                                 the next go we'll deal with the                                 completely different architecture yes                                 each other so the thing go back to                                 movies expression                                 so so yet once especially component                                 called standard environment distance                                 spdm that that is basically presenting a                                 set of basic unit abilities like LS CP                                 also contains TCC                                 instead of inviting salsa composer this                                 expression                                 one of the arguments the Senate                                 Environment component space is the                                 system identifier like                                                x                                                                    also a bill timed event season platform                                 even fire has are also different if you                                 for a different particular architecture                                 all right so you can furnish from just a                                 half of our memories here on the virtual                                 machine on your bathtub while a thing                                 you can store the moment that the same                                 machine even so that's what to be doing                                 our environment so in Hydra VF various                                 platforms that we also have Sigma in                                 freebsd                                                                  one environment and they have won their                                 fourth of a you can download built                                 results and mixed our buyers from all                                 kinds of architectures of stores in the                                 same mixer but you can because it's                                 reflected in the hash carry any the                                 configuration file we                                 next yup an easy reading can you guys do                                 sit down yeah yeah so did so the next                                 expression language is a turing-complete                                 language and you can use any statement                                 from next expression language which one                                 so you can also divide the configuration                                 and multiple files use some list                                 operations attribute set operations or                                 kind of fancy things you want there are                                 even some developers in our community                                 actively abusing certain functions to                                 achieve some interesting results but it                                 also tends to go wrong sighs okay                                 society comparison kinda directory like                                 it I cannot do build three boxes there                                 ah gross you know apply the same                                 integration five but slightly different                                 and sweet bridge which machines have you                                 enjoyed                                 and like yeah yeah so so unique so as                                 you can also say save some some base                                 settings and some machine precision                                 settings and combining by using next                                 language constructs together to concrete                                 confirmation that you want for that                                 particular machine yeah                                 or their compiled original system could                                 you repeat the question                                 well what you what you doin Nexus mainly                                 building food source so there are some                                 exceptions but but Nexus mainly a source                                 they suspect me                                 yeah so so you know that's another                                 interesting feature i haven't mentioned                                 in this presentation but the hashing                                 scheme also offer some kind of                                 optimization so in next year also open                                 channel mechanism so you can basically                                 download the channel manifesting with                                 some pre-built the bios artifact and                                 it's just comparing s code so if you                                 evaluate the function you have this hash                                 code and in the manifest it says okay I                                 this component somewhere else and it'll                                 download the component instead of                                 building it from source from your light                                 machine that's how many x deals with the                                 binary deployment is basically there's a                                 central service of binary tried yeah                                 that's our high-level server that's what                                 yeah yeah yes sir if you download the                                 mixer is ISO image from our website and                                 really pinnacle figure to use our a high                                 drive continuous build sir lets you                                 basically for all kinds of all vectors                                 which you don't have some find yourself                                 yeah if you want to use a an exhaust                                 package that but you want to eat I know                                 you're trying to avoid this to encode                                 dependency data saying that I'm based on                                 gtk in version such and such if you've                                 never acted that into hash keys and                                 you'll be comparing against particular                                 hash codes yeah but how is there a                                 conflict resolution scheme or is that do                                 you have some other mechanisms that you                                 based on that                                 so you mean so you said maybe conflict                                 resolution cases in which you have a                                 particular application using one person                                 ttk in another application is enough                                    we don't in the xos we don't use things                                 like LD library path for / SC / lb as                                 opal so it makes you ugly the art buff                                 issues for looking up like this and in                                 our cut also mixed or pop paths are                                 stored so if you run particular binding                                 using                                                             because it really are often identified                                 with this hash code another binary using                                 another variant was next door belt in                                 another fashion that's why you can                                 safely                                 but essentially some some kind of static                                 dynamic binding to you still have shared                                 language but they are balance of the                                 extra beautiful in a static man okay                                 easy way to eat the grey stuff of shadow                                 puppet we needs may be that they                                 provided that wouldn't change the                                 configuration place but maybe freedom                                 our guild of some sort so the people                                 could feel the need system using                                 something that that they've already know                                 I'm yeah yeah it wouldn't be in folsom                                 going to integrate existing solutions                                 into into linux and profits it's just                                 yeah I'm not sure about all the                                 technical little chef but I say I think                                 it should be possibly the reason why I                                 haven't done it so far east because I                                 wanted to stay close to the next                                 expression language and use those                                 concepts because if you use a different                                 kind of model I believe the chef uses                                 your fight will be moving in yeah so                                 then you guys can translate Rudy                                 constructs to mix and maybe some next                                 concept feedback to lure you                                 the event we make a mean to them                                 rejected of a sudden said what that is                                 but like you know it it's not very very                                 in line with the power system is                                 designed                                 means that what we don't wonder because                                 he do to meet women chatting Buffett                                 will be a good way to kind of get me                                 without your women to drive down you                                 know I can so we're flying                                 right now you know well yeah i don't                                 think i would reject any solution but                                 yeah it depends on how its implemented                                 in the hood the purposes are and also                                 with the limitations either but what                                 integration is not not undoable soon                                 okay other questions okay did I can                                 understand it correctly that there is no                                 real over hat as in don't store of the                                 same fallows multiple paths and                                 different paths it depends on the hash                                 codes in case so there are expanded its                                 own cases you have expensive upgrades on                                 Nick service so let's say if you die GMC                                 so from almost every package is                                 dependent on GMC then you have different                                 hash codes and if you don't install new                                 packets you like Firefox using the new                                 variant activity then you basically have                                 to deploy and complete new system next                                 year if TMC doesn't change them yeah                                 more than you can upgrade a sufficient                                 as standard package manager yeah so for                                 for every binary file under system you                                 don't have a duplicate somewhere else no                                 sir so for every component built up                                 under particular circumstances there's                                 only one instance yeah that's that's the                                 action to it so it if you donate the                                 bills function again and we look in next                                 door see how we already have provided an                                 ash code let me know we gotta feed okay                                 because it's our endeavor yes we be                                 people we because                                 for an ax murderer                                 so every user can say hi please                                 no that's already possible in excellent                                 so that users can also install software                                 basically asking to take ensures                                 isolation so if some user installs some                                 somebody asks the LS LS command doing                                 something harmful and a particular user                                 is lost in their environment to as a                                 different hash code so may not affect                                 our users using different variants and                                 that's already possible in excellence                                 the tag actually mrs. as one of its key                                 features that also improve its users can                                 safely install and                                 besides you                                 the room is a kanji                                 insulted and if                                 yeah that it will share as much as                                 possible when that's also do today okay                                 so if somebody uses the same insult the                                 same executable using the same team                                 achieved and only one GT instance issues                                 the sheriff machine does to you it also                                 this is also a moon happens for other                                 types of life is only the configuration                                 files and executables yeah if their way                                 to fall so crazy for instance open                                 purity issue is there a way to say like                                 well to avoid this library with this                                 hash yeah well there is a very a key                                 implementation made by my colleague you                                 go to deal with this but I don't know a                                 forest oasis it's not integrated in the                                 in the release but it's good question                                 it's something I'm very investigating                                 try to you pay all the questions do you                                 like how you consider installation                                 like you go to be during soul and                                 package yeah you have any way say like                                 resume for example the fact we had                                 actors could you would that make you                                 able say well these full bladders are we                                 supposed to install actually these two                                 and reading scores or just                                 zoom and salty                                 remove the jury it's something it                                 somewhere your your exhalation you know                                 Cicely on bro yeah so Nick's basically                                 US patent mixer itself containing an                                 s-code the nigs also maintains whether a                                 fantasy fell in love and so after the                                 deploying each component you're                                 registered if it's as fellows but is it                                 if your installation fill somewhere in                                 the middle and CEO this path is not                                 valid so I believe it do it again and                                 the person which are already registered                                 as fellas during little gate well you                                 don't have to touch them because they                                 ready their so let's have a so greats                                 are resumable amazing and find a nice                                 with instantaneous what do you mean by                                 illustrating the idea let's see some                                 things are                                 why we knew from using                                 sorry slow zones EJ you know it's kind                                 of a lightweight work there tried and I                                 can see how                                 maybe                                                                    clone a pilot system fill a shipping                                 container thank you for going to see how                                 you can work pretty well without Winx                                 yeah                                 looking majority to do is running                                 built-in changement environments                                 so as it gets a good questions I think                                 if you if you was running next built in                                  Jill then purity much better guarantees                                  that's right it's going to be the only                                  ever and built-in change with the                                  violence but I'm not not really in G                                  else but it couldn't lead make your                                  build process some more fury yeah that's                                  that's something mr. wasn't looking too                                  good that's but that's still good                                  oh yeah                                  cause a share for the                                  I couldn't hear the question time used                                  if you installed two different versions                                  of that there might be a lot of the                                  house                                  only the same                                  now the aspects could be shared                                  yeah that's right yeah we don't actually                                  saw them then indeed have two separate                                  is this firefox with a lot of redundancy                                  although we we have an optimization                                  feature impairing house and creating                                  mark links to similar forms that's                                  something we have methods it's very time                                  consuming to do that that's young                                  utilization we have but this binaries                                  are so similar but not exactly the same                                  then you still into the receptacle so                                  you do that afterwards well I rarely                                  execute this because some time consuming                                  but there is a feature that allows you                                  to use them if you if you like it's not                                  enabled
