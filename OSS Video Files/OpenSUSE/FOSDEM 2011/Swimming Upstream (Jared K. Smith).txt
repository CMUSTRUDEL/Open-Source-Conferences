	                              and you should move a bit over there                               this audio clip time because what                               otherwise you fell off the picture                               anymore okay here for this bird hey all                               right so uh my name is Jared Smith on                               the Fedora project leader I wanted to                               share a talk with you that give it a                               couple other conferences specifically                               about how the photo what is the purpose                                of a linux distribution how do they help                                upstream communities and why is it                                important that they work well with                                upstream communities it's not a super                                technical talk you probably heard all                                the things that I represent here today                                before and a lot of it's just common                                sense but I wanted to take the time to                                share some of the insights of the                                some of the things I found in working                                with for the freedom to the software                                having past several years and hopefully                                presented in a way that kind of gets                                catches your attention helps you think                                about some of these things as you go                                through them before i start with it's                                kind of a technical being of my taco i                                want to give you just a brief                                introduction to who I anybody know who I                                am I think it's probably the three or                                four people in the room who know who i                                am and everybody else is like this gym                                so i want to austin just a few seconds                                giving an introduction to do Who I am my                                name is Jared Smith like I said I'm the                                Fedora project leader um one of the                                things that I that I truly believe is                                that people tend to be kind of a sum of                                all their experiences in life and their                                experiences in life really make them who                                they are and so I want to give you a                                little bit about my background I grew up                                in the western part of the United States                                near a large national park we have                                called Yellowstone National Park here                                the grantee talk now is a very beautiful                                place to live but it's also a very cold                                place to live this is what nine months                                of the year look like we always tell the                                jokes that we only have three seasons                                its last leg for this litter the next                                one                                and as much of the United States looks                                like this right now after this big                                snowstorm thinking about the United                                States stuff that is where I grew up                                there was always those two or three                                weeks during the summer something that                                we actually have saw some beautiful                                weather and I always loved it to go down                                to the river the bull river that came                                through my count and I would spend every                                day during the summer at the river well                                I was either fishing in the river or I                                was floating down the river or I was                                swimming in the river I just loved to                                spend time down at the river and I want                                to use this idea of a river that's                                affirmative analogy as I go through this                                top today to talk about working with                                upstream well here's theres a river or a                                stream but I want to talk about upstream                                oh I love to fish don't get the                                opportunity to much fishing now I seem                                to be too busy but growing up especially                                as a child and loved to fish and when I                                was about Oh probably                                                  years old somewhere around there my                                father took me my brother and I took us                                to the ocean and we gotta go salmon                                fishing out of the ocean now what you                                know about salmon anybody here ever gone                                salmon fishing no your eat salmon yeah                                so a new one of the interesting thing                                about salmon is that they oftentimes                                live a lot of their life out of the                                ocean except when it's time to spawn                                then they will travel upstream they'll                                swim all the way upstream and go against                                the current to be able to go and spawn                                and then they go back out for the sea no                                baby done and that sometimes they die                                before they get it back embassy so they                                spending on all this effort to get up                                straight and then I'm done someday so                                why do they go that effort why do they                                spend all that time and energy it really                                the end of their life pushing so hard                                against the current through to reproduce                                that's an important reason I guess any                                 other reasons instinct instinct because                                 it's the right thing to do it couldn't                                 spawn in the ocean a lot lot lot the                                 technical reason i drive home from a                                 better environment and so I want to use                                 this snag and sort of an analogy of why                                 why do we want you know distributions to                                 push pages after quite work closer with                                 the upstream communities is easy now is                                 it easy for that salmon to set to swim a                                 string no even so long and put things in                                 the way to make it easy with you                                 but it is worth it it's it's it's                                 instinct it's a better environment I                                 think that that all contributes to the                                 wide would work well upstream somebody                                 made a little more about myself once I                                 grew up in left town and the University                                 studied Electrical Engineering I found                                 it as I was going through my electrical                                 engineering studies that I became a lot                                 more interested in in kind of the softer                                 side of the software side of things so I                                 spent a lot of times working on                                 computers and computer system okay I'm                                 not battled a lot of interesting                                 experiences but i think the                                 life-changing experience for me was a                                 Guinness class that i had in the                                 university and that's where I learned to                                 use the I really learn to use my fingers                                 and found an editor that could keep up                                 with my brain and in that really kind of                                 kind of opened my eyes to there's a                                 different way of doing things and these                                 small tools that you can learn and then                                 you can change these tools together to                                 create something bigger and for me it                                 was it absence in my opening because I                                 decided right then and there I said I                                 don't want to build circuits for the                                 rest of my life Oh unix key um a couple                                 years later a friend introduced me to                                 linux and that was that was a dream come                                 true so that was that was kind of how I                                 got started after i finished up with the                                 university get a number of jobs did some                                 i was a database administrator                                 programmer got into the systems                                 administration side of things managed                                 about                                                   web analytics company United States                                 that's really where i learned that okay                                 it's interesting and fun to set up a                                 linux server and run some services it's                                 a whole different ball ass to actually                                 go and set up large systems that have to                                 communicate and have to maintain up                                 times and family over and these sorts of                                 things and so there's there's there was                                 a set of skills that come from not just                                 being able to set up a server once but                                 maintain that server and everything over                                 a lifetime and so some lessons to be                                 learned here and i'll share some of                                 those um did that for a number of years                                 I've got really interested in voice over                                 IP in telephony wrote co-wrote the one                                 of the books on afterwards which is the                                 open source of telephony engine probably                                 heard about co-wrote the o'reilly book                                 on that i got into the documentation on                                 that side but really hadn't ducked in                                 and learn telephony and voice over IP                                 and eventually worked at did you couple                                 guys that the audience here did you have                                 as well and had a lot of fun in that                                 space and then this past summer redhat                                 maintained offer I couldn't refuse and                                 that was to become for project Lee                                 I saw him about the bakery                                 wanting the job or did die somehow trip                                 damage is thinking I was the right after                                 the job I haven't quite figured that out                                 yet but really enjoyed being the third                                 project leader I've been a long time in                                 fedora user everything to split off of                                 red hat long long time RPM package and                                 that sort of thing so so was it was it                                 was a natural fit how much hear some of                                 the experiences that now we're just the                                 past six months of the thorough project                                 that your butt in my water open-source                                 career about software development how                                 that happens so we want to start off was                                 Porter shaft where start does most                                 software gets started by committee does                                 innovation happen in a conference room                                 now I usually write it's usually                                 somebody has a great idea and they said                                 hmm I wonder and they start coding right                                 so code usually starts off there's just                                 a little trickle usually one person                                 maybe two people working together and                                 then it did it forms in the larger                                 communities so let's take this little                                 this little spring right here let's say                                 you know I river starts somewhere right                                 it starts with this little spring so                                 software just like that starts with one                                 people one person maybe two people maybe                                 to two or three people come together and                                 then join a couple of projects to make a                                 bigger project and pretty soon you build                                 a community around that piece of                                 software so what is a community                                 if i were to put a picture of the                                 community up here on this on the                                 projector is that community presenters                                 bunch of houses and is there a                                 difference somebody somebody had an                                 answer out there what's the difference                                 between a bunch of houses that live in                                 expectation shape their people and a                                 community a relationship the people                                 maybe some shared goals some common                                 interests so much what about software                                 communities is there a difference                                 between people that happen to be working                                 on this on the same piece of software                                 the software community infrastructure                                 may be named some infrastructure maybe                                 some relationships maybe some shared                                 goals or comedy I love the quote that                                 when it involves gave about community                                 somebody wants asking that a journalist                                 asking so what's the state in the Linux                                 community he said my next community                                 there's a bunch of people using Linux                                 for their own selfish interests I don't                                 officers after a community per se now I                                 like that quote for a couple of                                 different reasons one because you know                                 he's kind of have to have joking never                                 got there is obviously Linux community                                 but it shows that people are using the                                 software really for the further own                                 self-interest and that's okay that's not                                 necessarily a bad thing I have a                                 slightly different definition of                                 community especially when we're talking                                 about a software community and I like to                                 think of stuff software which                                 communities hesitating                                 it's a people we're different people                                 with different backgrounds different                                 experiences different goals can come                                 down sit together and have a                                 conversation share ideas outside he is                                 off of each other sometimes have some                                 healthy discussion and that's about                                 that's a very good thing now sometimes                                 we get into these bike shedding                                 arguments of what color should the table                                 d it should we painted green and                                 sugarcane of red and we talk more about                                 the table itself in the process of the                                 table itself rather than the software we                                 came to discuss but community is a team                                 we all bring our own set of experiences                                 are our backgrounds our own skills to                                 that table but hopefully when we leave                                 the table we've learned something and                                 we've made maybe the one better all                                 right so what do software communities                                 typically do while they built in                                 software and that gets bundled up and                                 put into some sort of distribution so                                 what is it distribution                                 it's not a trick question but the                                 distribution it's a bundling yes it's a                                 CD or DVD that comes out every so often                                 maybe every six months or every year                                    months right what's your sales for six                                 years continuously for continuously                                 maybe they're not me I'm maybe maybe                                 they don't catch that edited version                                 every six months but it's a continual                                 continually updating process okay so is                                 it distribution just just a collection                                 of software how does that organized how                                 was it integration so there's their                                 integration as well so typically most                                 most linux distributions but not on some                                 sort of concept of a package Frank for                                 these link building loss of software and                                 they often did agree with each other and                                 kind of plug-in restart I like the                                 analogy to using a Lego blocks anybody                                 you're likely play Lego blocks                                 absolutely lovely go I probably spend                                 more money on Lego than I spent on                                 computer hardware but just say at the                                 office these things happen now you see                                 the leg of us and                                 solution or the company Lego producing                                 makeovers distribution I see I i will                                 chip into the building these are being                                 building blocks that kind of stick                                 together and if it can form the                                 distribution Alan out of individual                                 packages hopefully it's not a                                 distribution is more than just a set of                                 packages hopefully a distribution might                                 be a set of cohesive packages that fit                                 together and there's some sort of                                 integration work that makes them work                                 well together and maybe there's even a                                 community informs up around the                                 integration of these packages together                                 into building a set that's not just                                 engineering set of packages but packages                                 together and work well together and play                                 nice together that's what I see it a                                 distribution really is man does that                                 make sense each each each individual                                 building block might be a pro to hang                                 maybe it's Q mail made an excellent or                                 maybe it's postage and it's also                                 documentation is about                                 information such as substructures so                                 when I buy it when I when I buy a set of                                 Lego blocks I'm about buying just the                                 boss now I'm getting the package of                                 getting the blocks I'm getting some                                 distance and instructions on how to put                                 the pieces together I'm getting some                                 nice marketing though this is what it                                 looks like when you're when you're done                                 and you put it all together so you paid                                 for more than just the plastic blocks it                                 really pay for the experience I think                                 that's that's really where distribution                                 shine is the ability to make these                                 different packages to put them together                                 put some nice window dressing on rights                                 and documentation provided a better                                 out-of-the-box experience and just                                 trying to roll roll your own from                                 scratch that make sense so we were                                 talking about both distributions and                                 free software in general we typically                                 you know use this analogy that I started                                 out with of a river right we have                                 upstream and downstream their visual                                 layer of that for those who may not be                                 familiar creepy though first of all we                                 have a BF upstream so upstream the                                 further you are upstream them closer you                                 are to the authors of the maintainer zuv                                 that code if your integrated into that                                 upstream environment the more influenced                                 you might have on that particular                                 package with that particular piece of                                 soft right if you're one of the court                                 authors you have a lot more leeway to                                 change the future direction of that                                 software package and if you're just a                                 name to user downstream the downstream                                 users have less influence on                                 that makes sense so we have upstream and                                 we have downstream now there's several                                 different yeah several different ways of                                 looking at this and they're certainly                                 people would say I don't care about                                 being upstream I'll just give it how                                 does it want to be downstream I want to                                 play in my own little sandbox I'm going                                 to do things my way I think it over the                                 past five or six years we've seen a                                 shift towards distributions being more                                 willing and more eager to work with up                                 straight communities and when they make                                 sure you try to push those back upstream                                 and certainly in fedora we've tried very                                 very hard to kind of change things that                                 way but Fedor I first started out we                                 have securing a lot of fast catching                                 dinner packages we weren't even bother                                 to try to push upstream that's too much                                 work it's too hard they don't want their                                 hands anyway and I think we've learned                                 over the past several years that that                                 was the thought that really wasn't the                                 wisest approach to doing that and so                                 will try to change things to where we                                 push things aggressively upstream as                                 much as possible to try to carry as few                                 of our own                                 patches and we'll talk a little bit more                                 about that as we go through here so i                                 want to point out just from that from                                 the fedora standpoint that you know we                                 ship it around as days you know this gal                                 of the kayak out here you know kind of                                 closer to the top strain and then if you                                 know further demonstrating we have                                 rented enterprises sum of the                                 derivatives impressed because of where                                 we are in the strait of through our I it                                 gives us a chance to see what's what are                                 the newest technologies that are coming                                 along have a chance to play and see how                                 they work really become to be on the                                 cutting edge of new features new                                 integration work that's happening in                                 those legs at the same time we can then                                 have other people kind of follow along                                 behind us see what works well in fedora                                 and then they can choose out that work                                 for the valve for we should take a look                                 at that                                 yeah that wasn't quite ready for you                                 should hold on to this that's right so                                 so we like to be you know a little                                 closer to the cutting heads a little                                 stood up straight and maybe some other                                 or Enterprise like distributions so what                                 do distributions really give besides                                 this packaging and integration piece to                                 software I've got a lot of different                                 things that I think about my when I                                 personally think of linux distributions                                 and what they do I why why they're                                 unique Oh the first one is it is a sense                                 of vision it's easy to say well I want                                 this package in this package in this                                 package of this package but most of the                                 distributions have some overarching                                 vision or goals or bug number one type                                 type motivation behind their their                                 distribution why does that distribution                                 exists why is it different than another                                 distribution is I think distributions                                 exists to to fulfill a goal to reach                                 some sort of submission in life                                 obviously you know different                                 distributions have a different goal and                                 that's okay I think that's a very                                 healthy thing I think the world would be                                 a very boring place if everybody thought                                 exactly a lot of eggs and so it's nice                                 that we have different distributions                                 focus on different things and still move                                 free software for within another thing                                 that I think sometimes we underestimate                                 the free and open source community is                                 giving people a chance to to participate                                 in something that's bigger than hers                                 knows people take pride as them they do                                 you know how many people here have                                 something in open source or written                                 documentation or will help out show show                                 to friend how many people take pride in                                 it I certainly it and I think too often                                 we kind of skipped ask them to frankies                                 how people do it for altruistic reasons                                 yeah they do too but sometimes it's just                                 good to take pride in something that but                                 I helped create this that's bigger than                                 myself so I think that's an important                                 part of the free software experience and                                 part the distribution is really to play                                 a role in i know that if i get this                                 package at the fedora if i push this                                 passion or work with upstream to get                                 this through this software package to                                 the fedora i know that hey that CD is                                 going to come out of six months and you                                 know I helped build that that's pretty                                 cool so private is private is                                 distribution get them yeah build                                 something and people going to be proud                                 the next thing that we do is try to                                 build communities we try to try to reach                                 out to people and give them a place                                 where they feel comfortable or they feel                                 welcome or they feel like their input is                                 valued or their suggestions or listen to                                 and there's discussion on the technical                                 merits yes or no she may be this take                                 this pastor should we do this thing but                                 we try to build just like this little                                 town of harm or Oklahoma we try to build                                 inclusive communities we try to reach                                 out to people from a lot of different                                 backgrounds a lot of different countries                                 a lot of different languages a lot of                                 different experiences and build you know                                 good communities the river that are very                                 inclusive so I think maybe maybe if I                                 can be critical for a minute here maybe                                 some sometimes we're not conclusive                                 enough within may open source                                 communities maybe we could reach out to                                 people who aren't necessarily packagers                                 or developers who are hardcore geeks and                                 reach out to attend to the average Joe                                 on the street he just wants an operating                                 system works                                 it doesn't necessarily need the                                 technical details of how do i set up a                                 male transporting hey just what's up                                 o-obviously distributions exist because                                 they bring a set of tools for the table                                 that people like to use all right you                                 get your compiler and you get your web                                 browser and you can sure you know the                                 tools you use to do whatever it is that                                 you do in this case you know something                                 something this is a tough photo from a                                 guy who like a career electric guitars                                 and just gotten old tools here with the                                 baby is every time the apt upgrade I                                 think many of us use linux because he                                 gives us the tools the exact tools we'll                                 need to do we enjoy doing whether it's                                 Friday software whether it's writing                                 documentation                                 belly building servers whether it's baya                                 systems whatever it is you do the                                 operating system shouldn't give you                                 those those tutors another part of the                                 whole of course experience and his                                 really bad on a school how many here did                                 everything about linux three or four or                                 five years ago we haven't learned                                 anything since not even one person razor                                 that's good that means we're all growing                                 we're all involving we're all better                                 than we were yesterday or the day before                                 yesterday yeah what's one of the things                                 I absolutely love my start of the UNIX                                 we've got into linux is there was so                                 much to learn that there are so many                                 people willing to take my hand and help                                 me learn them yeah there's a few of                                 those lessons I had to learn repeatedly                                 and hard way as I'm kind of stubborn at                                 times but let's not underestimate the                                 power of we all have something that we                                 can share what I'll have something that                                 we can work I love the same says that                                 none of us is as smart as all of us                                 because it really really typifies you                                 know how                                 open source communities work together to                                 help everybody get up to speed on on a                                 particular I don't think there's a                                 single person in this room that knows                                 everything there is to know about linux                                 or open source it's pretty soft sorry                                 but that isn't that means we have a                                 great opportunity to help you at school                                 house to help people learn the things                                 that we know how to share another thing                                 I love about about free and open source                                 software communities is the                                 opportunities of cross-pollination you                                 know there are people here with a lot of                                 different backgrounds with a lot of                                 different knowledge and I'm sure if I                                 said hey I need some help with                                 programming of microcontrollers there's                                 probably three or four or five people in                                 this room here that they lack of a lot                                 more about programming microcontrollers                                 that I'll ever know or if is a hey I had                                 a question about voice over IP or had a                                 question about firewalls I mean there                                 are people in this room that they're                                 experts and there's some great                                 opportunities especially at conferences                                 like this for chronic pollination sort                                 of collaboration because I hey I was                                 thinking about doing this and somebody's                                 body you know there's this other project                                 that did this this is what they were                                 asking there's tremendous opportunities                                 to rub shoulders with people you may not                                 ordinarily need and you may not                                 ordinarily be able to share information                                 and so that's one of the reasons I love                                 to come to conferences like really                                 getting different people with different                                 experiences                                 obviously a big part of what linux                                 distributions as well as his                                 communication lots and lots of different                                 mailing lists lots of lots of different                                 forums lots of different cubbyholes of                                 knowledge again enough not to be to                                 credit oblivion if I haven't dated sent                                 back maybe we have two minutes to too                                 many different little compartments for                                 the knowledge and not an easy way to                                 ways to share them either between                                 between distributions or between                                 different communities between the                                 different kimber software there's a lot                                 of knowledge out there but sometimes                                 trying to find the right cubby molar                                 that knowledge is that stuff okay maybe                                 it hasn't been documented maybe it's go                                 read the source Kevin Richard                                 optimization obviously this this whole                                 communication and documentation is                                 critical thanks for from the next                                 distribution to work on another thing                                 that i love about open source                                 communities is the idea of transparency                                 that things aren't done and seek your                                 things are done in a black box I can't                                 tell you how many times is a loan                                 the university is setting to be an                                 electrical engineer you were handed a                                 datasheet and here's this black box                                 here's how it's supposed to work just                                 just assume that it's going to work like                                 that and anybody okay not always sort of                                 be crazy i wanted teradoc open and see                                 what was inside why does it fine doesn't                                 work that way or why isn't it working                                 like it like it says it should and                                 that's really the idea of transparency                                 and openness that we're all you know                                 sort of on camera on a piano on radar so                                 to speak this is an interesting and                                 interesting topic but it certainly helps                                 for building trust in a community                                 building openness in the community                                 building those relationships with the                                 other people that you associate with                                 within a community that helps without                                 trust in the community you're not going                                 to get very far so transparency really                                 really is the key that I see to to                                 building trust with her now another part                                 for better or for worse people you know                                 distributions give people a soap box to                                 stand on and preach their particular                                 version of digit dare I say the word                                 open source religion it doesn't give                                 people an outlet Jenna to share share                                 their idea to share their concerns share                                 their you know                                 they're they're crazy crazy stories and                                 crazy ideas and yes this could be taken                                 to an extreme the opposite but sometimes                                 this is a very healthy thing and                                 sometimes this is just watching sausage                                 being made sometimes it's a lun healthy                                 I personally on the opinion that as long                                 as we can act like adults as long as we                                 can treat people civilly that I do the                                 healthy discussion is a wonderful thing                                 that's what sets us apart from other                                 software to dolphin loans obviously                                 there's a good side in that side to that                                 I think sometimes our own worst enemy                                 that way as well I think you can to tear                                 people down and publicly way too often                                 and when we do be appraised usually it's                                 a private and it's pretty quiet so I                                 think I think there's some opportunities                                 obviously there for improvement but the                                 good thing is that this is all a work in                                 progress right anybody here run the                                 perfect linux distribution and you're                                 never going to have to upgrade again                                 okay good that means there's room for                                 improvement i'm on a big fan of                                 continual improvement and processing Oh                                 as long as you're better today than you                                 were yesterday you're better tomorrow                                 than here today your head                                 and so there's lots of work we can do no                                 Lex distribution is perfect no piece of                                 software is perfect because I don't                                 thanks number one line of code but no                                 significant piece of software is in                                 perfect yet we need to keep working you                                 need to keep improving that's why we're                                 I keeps shipping a new set of saving                                 images every six months and that's why                                 people keep updating packages or writing                                 this offer we have a tremendous                                 opportunity to make a woman to have                                 their place I think it's human nature to                                 cut overestimate the short term change                                 and I'll sort underestimate the                                 long-term change as you know changing                                 the world so to speak I remember what I                                 first got connected to the internet and                                 people were saying oh you're going to be                                 able to buy books online and you're                                 going to be able to find all this                                 information and everything will be free                                 and I think I had overestimated just the                                 short term here what was going to happen                                 and totally underestimated the long term                                 how many of us would be totally lost if                                 we didn't have an internet connection at                                 least some sometime during the day                                    years ago                                                             there's no way I would have imagined a                                 little bit so plugged in the internet                                 but we couldn't even function without it                                 and I think hang in I think that's I                                 think that's that's human nature to                                 overestimate the short for underestimate                                 the long term that's all I want you know                                 certainly within fedora then I encourage                                 everybody else to take a longer-term                                 view of what changes we may shins in the                                 world are we making the world a better                                 place or we think                                 more packages are one of the one of the                                 things I ask the questions I asked at                                 the Fedora users and developers                                 conference last week is are we building                                 a bigger distribution or are we building                                 a better distribution interview                                 questions boom hopefully no but yeah                                 it's not just about bigger it's also                                 about matter honey lots of lots of room                                 for for continual improvement now on it                                 will just a second on kind of negative                                 sides oh you know who is who is the                                 enemy obvious it's not a little Lego                                 guys and we may go in there one more                                 time listen who is who is our enemy if                                 you ask me ten years ago I probably was                                 that oh the enemy is seven large                                 Software Corporation it's that's going                                 to squash in the next somehow if you                                 would have asked me five years ago three                                 years ago I probably would have all the                                 enemies that other Linux distribution                                 right there though they're the ones that                                 aren't playing fair and try this                                 question if you're an athlete aday now                                 who's the enemy in place for fedora                                 something I would say well probably the                                 biggest day of any good fedora today is                                 probably for the rest up I'm much more                                 concerned with the way we treat our own                                 communities with the way to treat the                                 people within our own                                 then concerned that some large                                 corporation was going to come along and                                 somehow get it squashes there's others                                 in the velocity talked about there this                                 is the really elite in my talk tomorrow                                 tomorrow Stefano from from Damien jokes                                 from Oakland Susie and I are leading a                                 panel discussion on collaboration and                                 cooperation and communication between                                 different distributions and how we can                                 how we can kind of r is the                                 signal-to-noise ratio there i thinkin                                 cooperate work makes sense and agree to                                 disagree where it doesn't make sense we                                 pleaded for that tomorrow um I do think                                 too many times we build up artificial                                 barriers either for people trying to                                 contribute to our distribution or people                                 trying to get into the open source way                                 of doing things too many times they say                                 well you really want to get to that bar                                 right there but you can't come through                                 this gate you have to go around the                                 corner and you have to sign this piece                                 of paper and they have to jump through                                 these three hoops and then maybe you                                 know we'll talk about it then maybe                                 maybe that you I found from from sad                                 experience typically the quickest way to                                 get things done in open source                                 communities is to get somebody a good                                 goal what what to accomplish give them                                 the tools in need and then stay out of                                 their way                                 do I we found that in fedora you should                                 be that we have food or wood buildings                                 at CD images and ship of off the red hat                                 and red happened go home don't the cds                                 and it was always a painful process and                                 we found out probably been six or seven                                 years ago six years ago we found oh my                                 goodness is so much easier we just tell                                 the community hey here's the money                                 you'll have to see these done just do it                                 I think it did after the better job a                                 better artwork and the whole nine yards                                 and so I've since then I've always tried                                 to keep an eye out for artificial                                 barriers are we putting out when people                                 do I have how are we competing people                                 from doing with the things they want to                                 do and try not to try to realize that                                 the last thing that the distributions do                                 recycle assam vegas the distributions do                                 is you give people a chance to be                                 created to tweak a lot of knobs you know                                 have a creative outlet that they can                                 that they can go build something and see                                 how it works now I need any audio                                 engineers in the room anybody like audio                                 there's a couple of people kinda sorta                                 rhythm and if you had if you had an                                 audio setup and I just came up to the                                 start of turned all the valves at once                                 how would you feel you'd be upset right                                 engine and so a lot of times I think                                 that they want to do this with a linux                                 distribution they tried information                                 distribution this is really cool but I                                 want to change this and this and this                                 abyss abyss and this and this is this                                 home and so you know I certainly when I                                 started the project with your people                                 came to me and set out for the words                                 totally growing together change this                                 this I'm tweeting this knob here turn                                 this number over here the volumes to I                                 over here I think as a project leader                                 part of my role is to say okay yeah                                 we're going to change some things we're                                 certainly going to mix things not                                 nothing nothing's chiseled in stone what                                 we're going to do it in an organized                                 manner first we're going to turn this                                 knob and see how they go then we're                                 going to turn this knob Nixon the stop                                 over here to fetch put some more dirt                                 and some process into making sure things                                 are done in an orderly fashion um the                                 last thing that the distribution to                                 really do is give people a chance if you                                 back early feedback is good you know                                 early early an office which one getting                                 scarcer me think that get anything that                                 you can do to encourage and constructive                                 feedback is a very healthy thing I think                                 most of the distributions do a fairly                                 reasonable job of this whether it's                                 through mailing lists and whether it's                                 through some crackers or other                                 as distributions tend to be fairly good                                 at listening to their to their                                 constituents listening to their users                                 and then trying to dress that's                                 something obviously you can all improve                                 honest I think there's a reason that we                                 were born with two years and one now but                                 hopefully some meaning in that I haven't                                 figured out what it is going to be too                                 busy talking there's there's feedback                                 mechanisms so now that I've gone through                                 this exercise what is a distribution and                                 why do we build distributions acquire                                 the important and one of the things that                                 they did that they bring to the table                                 let me ask the question of why why do we                                 buy why do we go to all this work                                 because it's fun that's it that's it                                 that's a very good reason some of us we                                 must get some satisfaction out of this                                 oh we wouldn't be here right so yeah                                 because it's fun but I think there's                                 there's a fundamental reasons why would                                 you why we do this at a fundamental                                 reason why it's so important to work                                 without straighten communities to to be                                 a good citizen to take an active part in                                 in software development and I think this                                 sign it really sums it up it's the best                                 time I can find the describe it that's                                 that we all live downstream and every                                 single one of us is it is a end user of                                 some sort of linux distribution either                                 you roll your own or you're using one of                                 the ones that                                 else is working but we all live down                                 straight just like you wouldn't go out                                 to the to the stream for motor oil down                                 as the storm drain how can we even do                                 that you know we certainly don't want to                                 to poison our software developer                                 communities by the fire actions and so                                 we all live down so we all want a better                                 environment we don't want things to be                                 better you know then we found them so                                 this is that enough reason why it's so                                 important that we build strong                                 relationships with other substrate                                 communities we stay actively engaged                                 with those upstream communities and try                                 not to surprise them i love the same                                 that engagement is the exact opposite of                                 surprised if we stay engaged if we stay                                 focused if we stay communicating with                                 those upstream communities we won't be                                 caught off guard by their cages and they                                 won't become that's that's what i had                                 its as far as a prepared talk on up                                 straight and distributions of myself for                                 when i left a few minutes for the                                 questions feel free to ask me questions                                 either of this or so are things or all                                 the things i might know about that                                 against you whispering in them i                                 mentioned earlier                                 aggressively push patches upstream what                                 happened curious open reading by                                 aggressively and what happens not                                 shooting for inverse or rejects it the                                 idea is it is is to make sure that we                                 give it to the upstream community in as                                 good a shape as we can explain why why                                 why we're using that s why we think it's                                 a good idea to go upstream and then if                                 the upstream wants it that's great if                                 they don't want it we you know we'll                                 probably keep it around as a passion or                                 in our packages obviously we want to try                                 to build lines of communication and                                 dialogue between between the group so                                 take afters for example if we're backing                                 packaging up after skips agoura we have                                 problems we've got seven or eight                                 matches against Astros pregnant we try                                 to not only just open the bug report                                 with Astros but talk to people say hey                                 this is why we're doing this is does                                 this make sense from a from a broader                                 view might this might this then offend                                 other other distributions as well to try                                 to you know start those conversations                                 it's not always an easy thing to pick                                 somebody up strain was just like that                                 not interested trying to go shopping                                 look whatever the case may be but at                                 least we given them a chance when we try                                 to try to explain why what are we going                                 to base the way the way that things me                                 it's not all the chicken changes are                                 going to love shrimp sometimes they're                                 just not not a good thing finally she                                 was trying to make a better                                 it's a upstream reject something you try                                 to promote something across distribution                                 wise at least you know sometimes it                                 really depends on the package and the                                 individual packager I mean some of that                                 discretion is a packager you know I                                 don't fit in in fedora for example we                                 have many packagers who are good friends                                 with the packagers from open suisei or                                 debian too and so they say we're using                                 this patches this at any interest to you                                 and then there's some sharing that goes                                 on probably not enough of that but there                                 isn't sure but it's very more it's very                                 dependent on individual packages                                 individual maintain furs to do that sort                                 of work with them probably not enough                                 formalized structure right a fearsome                                 hope the hope never to the question a                                 question right this is a just to comment                                 from upstream which is which is where I                                 mostly live in in my                                 both results work we get a lot of good                                 package suggestions good fixes from some                                 of our downs dreams sometimes sometimes                                 it great getting there straight away                                 advertise their coveted just happened to                                 come with a bad moment when they weren't                                 for time to look at them we've got to                                 look at the data and can be creative                                 people realize that and give us a nudge                                 to write right having it i think it's                                 about building a relationship of trust                                 their word where you're involved enough                                 in that extra community do you feel like                                 you can share things or things aren't                                 happening you can you can feel i can                                 give that nudge without being rude or                                 without being inconsiderate and i think                                  that comes of building a healthy                                  relationship between the airstrip in the                                  downstream the ideal situation is if you                                  have a developer which the packager who                                  is also a chemistry who is also a member                                  we have shrinking that's that isn't for                                  not always easy to do the middle of that                                  is important absolutely depends on the                                  detective solution in which we've got no                                  single making and i think is a bad thing                                  but that's the incision across there's                                  i'd also make straight hard feelin's                                  anything                                  yeah there's obviously difference                                  between the different distributions and                                  how they handle packages here some                                  malicious pressure professional care                                  hand so all of this comes down to the                                  package earth to how he behaves against                                  upstream or maybe                                  is there any way that the lower-priced                                  day care packages and                                  sure so there's several things inside                                  fedora which I'm most familiar with for                                  we're trying to trying to address those                                  concerns the first thing we do is that                                  we try to make sure that we have at                                  least one person for every package is                                  the package the front of your package                                  minutes and we have packaging guidelines                                  that try to set what this is this is                                  what you should do this is what you must                                  do is you know this package to try to                                  encourage good behavior with upstream we                                  also have a group of people within                                  fedorova would call proven package                                  people who are able to go in and apply                                  security fixes and help out with                                  packaging let's say I made Gators on                                  vacation or a maintainer decides to eat                                  and fondle to share this packages of a                                  given moment these proven packages can                                  come in and help out and kind of fill in                                  the gaps work for individual packages                                  make a busy may fall down those are a                                  couple of mechanisms that we use to try                                  to try and deal with that in the most                                  extreme case we have a process for a                                  non-responsive maintainer so that we can                                  try to get the package reassignment                                  alert them to the fact that there's bugs                                  that are out here not being addressed in                                  the video too yeah debian has that too                                  with becca street                                  that                                  oh they say some tacony the question was                                  is there a small problem in fedora will                                  sometimes package reviews taking a long                                  time the frank answer to that is yes                                  sometimes of those things entirely too                                  long is entirely too much of a painful                                  process to do that it's always this                                  trade-off between giving people know the                                  flexibility they need the trying to hold                                  some sub level of accountability and                                  some standard to be having some                                  consistency across the package says yes                                  oh the the way to package reviews handle                                  are handled in torres is very ad hoc at                                  times it's very hey i'm trying to get                                  somebody to review my eggs won't anybody                                  please review my package and really have                                  to almost depend on something interested                                  in that package for knowing enough about                                  the particular domain that package is                                  harder to really do a thorough review I                                  could I could review all fanta java                                  messages that my room the best person in

         that we've encouraged is is I'm swapping                                  of reviews and so why not our mailing                                  list we encourage people to say hey I'll

  package there because obviously that                                  doesn't scale very well outside of these                                  space conferences but yeah there's

            analogy I can use that I use this from                                  before is that yeah yeah let's say you                                  have a daughter and your daughter comes                                  to you and said dad I want honey what's                                  the first thing that comes into your                                  mind oh no never mind open the pony and                                  probably gonna feed it I'm gonna have to                                  clean up after it it's just going to be                                  a mess okay why don't we take that same                                  approach to software too many people say                                  well I wrote the software and it's done                                  software is a living breathing animal                                  you have to feed it you have to clean up                                  after it every once in a while you have                                  to take it to the veterinarian heaven                                  forbid you never have to put it out of                                  its misery but software is not static                                  software isn't just walking the lift                                  that is done things change operating                                  systems changed to know the library's                                  change requirements change power supply                                  is done our Drive done all these things                                  how these things happen and and so I                                  think I get trying to take the longer                                  term view of software in general I think                                  you think of any more was a living                                  breathing animal where rather than I                                  wrote the code it's done I don't have to                                  touch that I guess the flip side of that                                  coin is if it's worth writing it's                                  writing again                                  sometimes we write another question my                                  love hewitt's much easier for community                                  which consists of a lot of extreme                                  developers as well as the door is how                                  many Hyatts allow developers to plan                                  changes then for the distribution which                                  come this less asking developers so it's                                  always easy for the perfect like to go                                  which one is i know i'm not sure how                                  many have to develop this weapon highest                                  overall but it's quite a large number to                                  say hey Justin let's take a look at the                                  recent problem for example who has with                                  his long shall they try to put some                                  changes and navy dated did it the right                                  way either not involved I was involved                                  but rather that's two tone split off and                                  then for to their own desktop                                  environment so my point of view is                                  always easy to motivate if you're on the                                  city in such a glass is to go I                                  obviously I'm not have appeared upon                                  faders and sales person did this wrong                                  or the stinking is wrong this                                  community's bomba you know there's third                                  there certainly is something to be said                                  for not to hang a distribution the                                  packages upstream software but really                                  active in those up free communities and                                  works with it that's not to say there's                                  not going to be differences of technical                                  opinion you know people people in this                                  room and certainly on the entry and open                                  source software are smart people anytime                                  you get enough smart people together in                                  one place there's gonna be technical                                  discussions is this the right way resist                                  a long way sometimes she can be juvenile                                  discussions it's going to find out are                                  you right or am i right but but there's                                  going to be technical differences and                                  that's okay that's a very much like I                                  said as long as we can remain civil as                                  long as we could you know act like                                  adults that's a very healthy thing and                                  it's what sets us apart but yeah being                                  involved in those upstream communities                                  is key that's not to say there aren't                                  gonna be forced to lack of these splits                                  assignable this is and some degree that                                  keeps everybody undertones that is a                                  healthy thing again the world would be a                                  very boring place if everybody thought                                  exactly like I'm                                  and we also in some ways the diversity                                  helps ya can help keep everybody on                                  their toes and gives us all something                                  dead at work or make things better keeps                                  us from being complacent I think we have                                  time for for one maybe two more                                  questions we have to have a thin line                                  between upstream and downstream you                                  shouldn't just below the line and say                                  that if somebody packages for some                                  projects that are actually working on                                  the project so it's a blurred line that                                  says that if we are positive we are also                                  working a project like this is learn                                  line between anything somebody working                                  it's always going to be a blurry will                                  argue my exactly where that is I think                                  some distributions haven't have a pretty                                  first yeah clear definition of give your                                  coding for this particular software and                                  then your then your upstream if you're                                  just packaging the Nets down other other                                  distributions it's more of a gray area                                  in between well his documentation you                                  know if you're working a documentation                                  pushing the app stream is that of                                  streams that's bit strings that                                  downstream things on                                  for their thing in any case whenever                                  you're doing work on the package is                                  always going to be sorry Morgan my shirt                                  and and sometimes in my feelings one I                                  one second you mentioned ended up taking                                  over upstream aces for one of the                                  factors that was maintained so I think                                  the line always a nice safety blurrier                                  sometimes you could leave the spirit it                                  all depends on your secret if you're                                  talking about very large searching for                                  things might not be easy to be part of                                  the action team there and exactly and                                  suddenly it just depends on the project                                  but I think the heat going to take away                                  is not you know if is it upstream                                  downstream towards that one I think the                                  key thing is forming those relationships                                  with the upstream community so that                                  they're not surprised by what you're                                  doing and you're not surprised I was at                                  that show some level of engage                                  commitment to that community                                  such a tough communication to I'm                                  surprised one size again so nobody went                                  surprise right if you're a packager and                                  then somebody's upstream does something                                  that's ugly catches you by surprise                                  advantage that's never won and if you're                                  packing packing them fighting focusing                                  togaf your upstream downstream package                                  or does something that really surprises                                  you that is not so funny so again                                  avoiding surprises there                                  alright one last question he's got one                                  going once going twice and sold divided                                  oh thank you for coming to positive I've                                  got my email address up here ship people                                  have other questions
