	                              trying to provide some degree of                               official enablement and support for                               broader set of distributions than just                               sort of the couple big name enterprise                               commercial distributions that everybody                               pretends to know love and or hate and in                               the process talk just a little bit of                               that sort of the evolutions last year                               but first up I'm curiosity how many of                                you never heard me give a toxin before                                dirty okay well very very quickly then                                just so you know who I am and have a                                little bit of context I tell people on                                me my first contribution to what we now                                call free software in about nineteen                                seventy nine it was a piece of assembly                                language for a microprocessor which was                                obscure then that's now completely                                forgotten but it led me down a sort of                                interesting path                                really interesting career of doing                                things in frame open source world I had                                the privilege for the last almost ten                                years we're serving as the chief                                technologist for open source of energy                                and what exactly that means it's                                probably just as much of a mystery of                                using this to you that it means really                                that I've had the opportunity to help                                advance the way the company thinks about                                free software and more recently open                                source and that's really important                                because HPS become such an incredibly                                great company with one foot in the world                                wide RT space and I'm pleased it on the                                whole I think the company hates                                reasonably well around free software                                open source projects and I think we've                                actually managed over the years to have                                you very positive influence on a bunch                                of different projects unfortunate                                Shandra colors today not only become                                instead against an apartment personal                                history but just big weekend for us                                the thing the other thing to serve                                couldn't happens i did go borrow a                                couple slides in the market guys i hope                                you won't be too offended by that but i                                don't think everybody understands                                because our marketing guys aren't always                                as good about getting the message out as                                they could it should be you know for                                more than a decade HP has been the                                largest seller in the world black                                servers and related kit we have not                                always been the folks talking the most                                about a linux or even in fact making the                                biggest investments in price offered                                linux development but we have now                                consistently for more than a decade in                                market leaders notes and part of the                                reason for that i believe is that we                                have taken wife is such a sort of a                                genuine anyone an honest approach to                                trying to understand how to work within                                our community development processes and                                have ended up as a consequence enable                                all sorts of things                                it felt able to do of course another                                marketing slide just because though we                                are doing things that are sort of unique                                within the big server iron industry the                                triumph revised support for                                non-commercial and other community                                distributions I don't want you to think                                for a moment that we don't also do all                                of the things that they mission-critical                                enterprise customers want to have us to                                be you know the most successful supplier                                to disfigured supporter of commercial                                linux distributions we do that we are in                                fact mercy on partners with redhead                                apologize that the Red Hat's line                                because it's Christmas there are a lot                                of things we do it's led great benchmark                                results it started to you know strong                                commitment from various companies and                                ability for lots of customers who want                                to run the really big commercial                                applications on top of wonders                                do that in the fall of                                             something a little unexpected I think we                                have for years not just because in my                                position involvement isn't but because                                of any other in a chain and also                                discovered and be working with WM with                                other non commercial distribution we                                found ourselves the situation where                                customers asked for it we looked around                                 in ourselves in drawers that we really                                 could provide the same kind of                                 commercial support offerings for the WM                                 distribution that we've been providing                                 for a red happen for develop scissor and                                 to a lesser extent some other                                 geographically specific distributions                                 prior to that we've done some press                                 releases with the agent of folks for                                 example but that was all very                                 geographically constrained now here it                                 is what it's about us for almost four                                 and a half years later invested my                                 knowledge was still the only producer of                                 iron serves that provides official                                 support offerings for a distribution of                                 enzymes                                 commercial distribution and this to me                                 is something that I'm still very proud                                 but it's extended lost today there's a                                 whole range of distributions HP provides                                 some degree of official support under                                 live report and internally these get                                 thought about is is very much being                                 distinguished between commercial                                 distributions and community                                 distributions you can get picky about                                 what that battery really means but                                 inside the company it's a useful way to                                 think about the different and what it                                 really has to do with is a combination                                 of what sort of non-hp badge human                                 resources and money and other things are                                 available to help push the results of                                 the work forward combined with how do                                 people think about it what do they                                 actually want from becoming like HP so                                 we talked about commercial distribution                                 these are partnerships this is where                                 there is some company behind Lennox                                 distribution that actually can engage in                                 sort of all of the normal business                                 dealings and business relationship                                 mechanics with they can you join                                 marketing things we can work on all                                 sorts of things that                                 sense to people who've used to buying                                 commercial proprietary operating systems                                 at the other end of the spectrum a lot                                 of customers who tell us we just want to                                 buy your hardware what we want to know                                 before we buy your hardware that is                                 really going to work with our                                 distribution choice and that ends up                                 being kind of the difficult and to do                                 because if you're going to spend the                                 time and energy to go out and test a                                 particular distribution on burglar that                                 requires an investment of time and                                 manpower and other resources and if                                 there's no direct mechanism for                                 generating revenue from that activity if                                 you don't get to sell some support                                 contracts or something at the end of the                                 day how do you just about it's how do                                 you quantify what those turn on that                                 investment you can't just say we'll sell                                 a few more boxes because everybody who                                 makes what they think are and customers                                 seem to believe for some of the world's                                 best industry standard servers believe                                 they're gonna sell both servers really                                 and so internally the process of                                 figuring out how to justify doing extra                                 work that's required to be able to                                 validate the community distribution to                                 the fact work on over we will provide                                 even some lightweight support the                                 building items like                                 client support packs for distributions                                 that weren't already part of the                                 official support now it's been a really                                 interesting challenge and I'm just                                 really tickled that over time we figured                                 out how to do that and part of it is                                 because we ended up establishing what I                                 think there's a very strong                                 relationships with key contributor to                                 different information so what comes out                                 of this other than just the notion that                                 we put a logo on your website and sort                                 of implied if you run that distribution                                 will still love you it's that HP                                 actually produces these things called                                 the line support packs what they used to                                 be that these were important because                                 they contain device drivers for her                                 number they mostly don't contain device                                 drivers anymore because one of the                                 things that we very successfully gone in                                 the last years is upstream all the                                 interesting drivers that are part of                                 making the cool extra value added                                 hardware on HP proliant servers work and                                 so today is the norm that people running                                 backs in any distribution on that HP                                 proliant server can do so with an                                 untainted that didn't used to be true                                 yeah why did you put by the mud race I'm                                 sorry what why do you find light reason                                 because of library versions                                 ya gotta have erection I freely admitted                                 their bugs in the stuff that's been                                 shown and those guys keep working on it                                 and over time it gets better it's a heck                                 of a lot better now than it was a year                                 and a half ago for example where we're                                 still shipping                                                          be                                                                distributions yeah well you know get a                                 kind of work most of the time it's been                                 very interesting because one of the                                 things we discovered is that there's                                 quite a bit build machinery didn't put                                 in place some time to build the south of                                 the                                                                    knives and the folks had originally                                 built a lot of the machinery were not                                 around anymore and so a permit that's                                 been getting people to be willing to                                 commit enough human resources to go                                 unwind some of the dependency chains                                 figure out why it is that we run things                                 the sometimes crazy ways they're driven                                 before than before and actually go                                 rebuilt some of that infrastructure in a                                 way that it does the right things from                                 honor distributions there are folks that                                 are still hard at work trying to get all                                 this things right but I would argue that                                 every time there's a new PSP release                                 they seem to be getting                                 if they don't seem to be getting better                                 gee it's a button tell us and figure out                                 quickly yeah and if you're not getting                                 good response from them oh my sport                                 channels for those things my email                                 address is portrayed with post-its                                 anyway I do want to point out but there                                 are a couple of more or less official                                 channels for providing feedback about                                 What's in these patients today they must                                 have things like pageant agents and user                                 space humans that will do things like                                 monitor the health of the silver / using                                 the drivers that are the colonel to                                 interpret some of the information coming                                 from the baseboard management processors                                 and so forth yeah I would love in a                                 perfect world at all of that stuff at                                 the hundred percent open source but the                                 reality is some of these things are                                 things that continue to be the points of                                 differentiation for the company so these                                 pscs have optional userspace demons that                                 you can run if you want to be able to                                 take advantage some of the capabilities                                 that are hardware today to Dustin my                                 knowledge and none of those require                                 tinting your panel which is a huge                                 change from a couple years ago                                 and then I do want to point out the                                 feedback that's come in through either                                 HP's ippf center and deforms                                 instructions perps that exists there or                                 you know for the last year and a half                                 through the extra work site we're good                                 to go to talk a little bit more about a                                 minute of those have actually influence                                 of thinking about how to prioritize some                                 of this work and how these things have                                 gotten deliver so don't think that we                                 don't listen because we really really do                                 and when I talk to the guys in Houston                                 and put Commons to do a lot of this work                                 the biggest request they had a V was                                 please figure out how to get people                                 label more feedback because they would                                 just love to hear from you an amazing                                 even there so the community linux that                                 works like how many of you know about                                 this urban okay for us if you should                                 take a look the objective and creating                                 the site was to create a place outside                                 of                                 hp's on IT infrastructure all of this                                 process rules and a lot of that what                                 people could collaborate in a very                                 offended community kind of way on to                                 talk about what takes to make the next                                 work well on the vast rapid products                                 that company produces in fact we'd be                                 completely happy to see people talk                                 about other systems and servers there as                                 well but I think the painted it's kind                                 of come out of all of this everybody                                 said knows that h                                                       responsiveness advantage consistence                                 that are talking about this is intrusive                                 linux common in                                                      really huge site it's not competing CNN                                 com wife after attention but if at that                                 there are                                                              day just day in and day out of the time                                 suggested me that this really is saints                                 and use and recently we've started being                                 a little more outreach buying food with                                 date with the knowledge that we're                                 getting close to releasing wt's a couple                                 of weeks three weeks or something ago                                 our presentation we put out over the                                 cluster the customers who were                                 interested i will try the                                 they release deputy's and smaller stuff                                 and let us know if their problems with                                 Alliance isn't it is that actually there                                 are in fact I got feedback and directly                                 from friend last night who was sitting                                 up almost right here still daylight in                                 the u.s. is the process of Islamist                                 agency do dl                                                    combination of the much cleaner handling                                 for firmware objects for devices with me                                 tumblr blogs and the ease with which you                                 can now create a USB stick to install                                 fun things like that it was all just                                 working great and I'm hoping that he                                 will I go to him a little bit to go                                 actually and post his recipe for doing                                 this what similar that happens if you do                                 take a look at the site I think that                                 sometimes soon will probably be in a                                 survey that's posted there we're                                 variation trying to understand what                                 other people think the site is really                                 useful and if so what it is that's good                                 about it and if not we have                                 because this is certainly something                                 where we're trying to sort of having a                                 place where people can come together the                                 fabric issue of those practices and you                                 don't have to depend on sort of you know                                 the randomness of the results to come                                 back from the Google search or something                                 to figure out you know how many things                                 work in particular hardware so if                                 harming summarize all this quickly i                                 think the most important factor behind                                 our ability to do this is the really                                 really simple thing that we've been put                                 down two years which is if you want to                                 support linux hardware well the thing                                 you have to do is get all your drivers                                 in the country if you do that the rest                                 of this gets really really easy and in                                 fact one of my big concerns for the                                 future is that we are now a situation                                 where as i said you can run an untainted                                 kernel and be completely functional in                                 the vast majority they should server                                 products but we are moving into a period                                 of time where product development teams                                 of staring at the processing cores and                                 the flash memory                                 Ramakant putting on higher Kurds and                                 staring at the ever-increasing core                                 counts and central processors and                                 they're thinking about the bus bandits                                 that are available between the                                 processors and IO devices and this                                 function heads wondering why they're                                 still downloading firmware to landlord                                 processor on board and I don't intend to                                 suggest that there's some huge switch                                 that's about me flip here but I think                                 over time unless they somehow come to                                 believe that the value-added associated                                 with some of these either devices living                                 controllers for example it less                                 accountable leave that that's all best                                 contributed into open source space we                                 could very easily find ourselves                                 backsliding into the situation we're                                 proprietary content starts percolating                                 back up from below the firmware boundary                                 into things that they want to have run                                 in the main processors on redress face                                 if that happens then all of a sudden you                                 know I get very frustrated because it                                 will feel like a lot of progress is                                 being lost I don't know whether this                                 will really happen but as i watch sort                                 of the two leaves being strewn and the                                 forces that are at work out there I                                 worry that at some point me Anakin                                 situation or just handling don't worry                                 blogs isn't going to be supposed to be                                 back to messing with I think we've                                 already been there you have a woman's                                 and winners printers in the past                                       one is my ass communicator Nickelback                                 actually yeah okay I think the reason is                                 mostly filled it was because people also                                 realized it's something slimmer and if                                 you especially if is open on this is                                 where it works because involvement if                                 you have have if you need to use your                                 process for device driver book from                                 doing more defensive work that will also                                 requires you to have parts of process                                 and it's not necessarily a good thing                                 yeah but you can pick up the economics                                 of its if we can take some of our                                 dollars out of io device and we're all                                 ready to the point where we have servers                                 even even inexpensive servers that have                                                                                                        know and we're several several doublings                                 Shive where I think the court thing is                                 can settle down and transistors on an                                 ancient for getting really really cheap                                 compared to anything                                 both because it's a suffering more                                 expensive development environment                                 everybody right we almost saw a lot of                                 time dwelling on this I don't want                                 everybody to walk away saying oh video                                 thinks the world's gonna backslide it's                                 going to get worse I've come to                                 understand all the things that keeps me                                 awake it is figuring out how we avoid                                 ending up in the situation I'll take                                 steps backwards and we may be sunday                                 ended up not being able to untainted                                 curls again because of you so today                                 Oh                                 agency                                 I'm sorry I'm having a good time Gary                                 not so can the door be open to I was a                                 very open to strip gel HP yeah one side                                 plates right these are any trim /                                      technical boots or GDC well I mean from                                 a couple inches of users are suppose to                                 both our server and our notebook guys                                 were absolutely convinced that they have                                 substantial important intellectual                                 property for reading in their BIOS                                 history I'm very careful easing the word                                 they hear because it's not an opinion                                 that I completely agree with but I will                                 continue to believe that probability                                 that they will move to a more open bio                                 strategy or some other booting strategy                                 seems small in fact the trend I see is                                 at the industry across lots of                                 architectures is as likely to converge                                 on the f                                                               and that is a trend that now has lots of                                 momentum behind it and is unlikely to                                 change short of some major miracle so                                 for better for worse I think that's the                                 world we're heading towards I think it's                                 a better world than the world of sort of                                 legacy pc viruses for a lot of reasons                                 but it's certainly not the future I                                 would have chosen I got                                 as you are talking about no boobs since                                 your whole slides is about servers yeah                                 that's part of the business I actually                                 give most they also do work on the lot                                 of summer yeah we actually shift work up                                 folks with linux preloaded on them than                                 anybody else in the world the problem is                                 that the bathroom target is going to                                 geographies and I don't visit sorry out                                 this the search ends of this changing                                 there is every chance of changing but                                 you have to think about what it is that                                 we actually caused it to change right                                 what caused it to change is a radical                                 change in the request / commandery                                 customers a top perform other venues you                                 know over the years about the very                                 strange economics when you start talking                                 to very high volume products and yeah                                 I've done what the numbers are but it's                                 something more than                                                  unquote pc HP shift last year and so                                 even though the number of machines they                                 ship preloaded with Lennox is huge by                                 comparison to any of our competitors                                 it's still just a drop in the bucket and                                 the problem is that spread across a                                 bunch of different models a bunch of                                 different product lines so trying to                                 find any single place where you would                                 look and say oh that's the product that                                 you really ought to put on the shelves                                 at best buy                                 Virginia City and with it with a pretty                                 low tide is tough having said that                                 there's all sorts of interesting stuff                                 coming up kit you have noticed a part                                 palm webos is part of HP now                                 with their Mars follow us and webos me                                 yeah I will leave you to ponder what                                 that might mean for the future with the                                 chemist I will try to hit that the fact                                 that you're not as confused about it and                                 see what I paid but yeah there's a lot                                 of things happen there are a lot of                                 really interesting things happening and                                 I don't tell the firewalls in any way                                 shape or form static in fact I think                                 they're all sorts of exciting things                                 that we're going over any love which the                                 major news items in the coming months                                 but we don't ever talk about things                                 aren't lowest you wish a lot more than                                 any other last questions is probably for                                 the show thank you for your time                                 you
