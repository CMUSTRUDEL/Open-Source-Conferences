Title: Tim Serong: Cross-Distribution Packaging Made Easy - OSDC 2011

Description: 
	One of the challenges for Linux software developers is the need to build packages that run on a variety of distros. Usually this means you need to be running several versions of each distro you want to support, and build binary packages for each one. Frankly, this sucks.

Happily, there is an easier way with the Open Build Service. OBS provides the infrastructure to create packages for openSUSE, SLES, Fedora, RHEL, CentOS, Mandriva, Debian and Ubuntu, all via a convenient web interface. Rather than using "compiler farms" of different hardware, OBS creates a clean VM instance for each build, saving time and resources. Collaboration tools are provided, supporting different user access rights, merge requests and review functionality.

This presentation explores the various features of OBS, and will show you how your life (well, the software packaging part of your life) can be made much easier.


Tim is currently employed by SUSE as Senior Clustering Engineer, working on the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension. If HA clustering has taught him anything, it is that you can never ever have too many log files. Interests include motorcycling, beer, and making technology simpler and more reliable (although not necessarily in that order, and usually not all at the same time).
