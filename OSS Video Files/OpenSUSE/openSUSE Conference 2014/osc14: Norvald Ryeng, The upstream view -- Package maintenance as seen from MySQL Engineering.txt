Title: osc14: Norvald Ryeng, The upstream view -- Package maintenance as seen from MySQL Engineering
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	MySQL is the world's most popular open source DBMS, with a large user
base on Linux, Windows, OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris, and others. At Oracle
we work with package maintainers in several Linux distros to deliver
high quality packages both in the distros and in our own repositories.

This talk focuses on how it is to be a fairly large project upstream
of several Linux distros. This includes handling differences between
distros, request for new functionality in stable releases, etc.
