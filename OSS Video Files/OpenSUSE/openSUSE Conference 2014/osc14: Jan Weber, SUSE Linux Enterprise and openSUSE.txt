Description: 
	openSUSE is the upstream of SUSE Linux Enterprise, but what does this mean?
What do openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise have in common?
How can openSUSE benefit from SUSE Linux Enterprise and vice versa?

Join this session to learn more about the relation between openSUSE and SUSE Linux Enterprise, right from the mind of a SUSE Product Manager.

opensuse what do Spencer's I have in

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:11,480
common what r is the view of the product

00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,130
managers for sizzling zenterprise on

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,300
opensuse what do we have in common what

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,800
we share what do we give each other's so

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,630
what is susan's giving back to the

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,880
opensuse community what is the opensuse

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:27,240
community providing Sousa or suse linux

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,610
enterprise specifically in terms of

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,950
functionalities features and so on so

00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:38,070
let's first take a little bit of a look

00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,570
what's behind opensuse and SUSE Linux

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:45,360
Enterprise two names that you can

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,360
basically classify into portfolios if we

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,780
are talking about opensuse what do we

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,079
mean if I say I'm an opensuse member

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,969
what this means is i'm part of the

00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,120
opensuse project I'm part of the

00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,149
opensuse community if I'm say I'm

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,949
running opensuse then I'm not talking

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,479
about the project necessarily I'm not

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:09,150
talking about the community but I'm

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,189
talking about the distribution then some

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:13,680
people when they talk about opensuse we

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,869
are talking about factory we're talking

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,350
about tumbleweed education and a whole

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,470
bunch of other things that classify as

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:24,750
opensuse so what I want to focus on is

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:26,700
the project the community and a little

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,520
bit of the distribution and some of the

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,180
other parts also come into play and as

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,079
with opensuse which can mean basically

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:42,180
any of those terms sizzling zenterprise

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:45,049
is a cover-up name for the larger part

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,850
of the Susan portfolio so we got our

00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,549
server products which are all part of

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,710
the sizzling enterprise family for

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,170
specific architectures and so on we have

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,549
extensions to those servers which are

00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,610
also part of the suse linux enterprise

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,310
family we have support offerings which

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,360
are part of the suse linux enterprise

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,460
family we are talking about

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,530
virtualization where we have specific

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,360
products and offerings we're talking

00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,489
about desktop where we have specific

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,310
offerings we are talking about

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,530
management where we have

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,750
different offerings that not fall into

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,349
the sonics enterprise family but are

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:25,250
also part of the overall souza portfolio

00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:27,500
and also fall into managing sizzling

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,530
enterprise systems and last but not

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,060
least we have the cloud so also sizzling

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:36,890
enterprise can mean a lot of different

00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:39,380
things now I wanted to talk a little bit

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,360
about the differences and one of the

00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,360
major differences between opensuse and

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,650
suse linux enterprise is certifications

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,650
and that was one slide too much

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,370
certifications are a big part why we

00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:57,459
have sizzling zenterprise and that's one

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,610
of the major differentiations between

00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:03,739
opensuse as the distribution and suse

00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,380
linux enterprise as an operating system

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:08,890
we have is vs who are certifying

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:12,290
software on suse linux enterprise server

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,120
desktop depending on what you want to do

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:15,860
or what the application is we have

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,019
hardware vendors that are certifying

00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:21,410
their hardware for usage with suse linux

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:24,739
enterprise we all of this is not really

00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,930
there for opensuse so this is one of the

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,030
key differences why there is a

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,769
difference between opensuse and suse

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,390
linux enterprise when it comes to the

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:37,579
difference tributions another rather

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,459
largest part of a difference is the life

00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,769
cycle and also the board mentioned this

00:03:40,459 --> 00:03:46,370
in the keynote that the life cycle for

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:50,079
opensuse might change to something most

00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:54,709
likely it will not get shorter I guess

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:58,880
Richard you could say something more so

00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:01,280
currently we have an open zuzu release

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:05,389
cycle of every month every eight months

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:11,989
there's a new opensuse release 13 or 113

00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:14,720
dot 213 or 340 not 114 240 14 3 and so

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:18,590
on the life cycle of each of those

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:23,380
releases is 18 months so two new

00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:23,380
releases plus two additional months

00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:28,310
get other projects or other parts of

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,710
opensuse that aim at different things we

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,540
got tumbleweed which is basically

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,360
somewhere in between because it's

00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:38,600
getting stable package update upgrades

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,690
in between this life cycle of one

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,790
opensuse release and after those 18

00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:46,340
months you don't get any maintenance

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,389
anymore you don't get any security fixes

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:54,470
and so on with suse linux enterprise

00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:57,200
this looks a little bit different what

00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:00,500
we have in terms of a life cycle is we

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,200
got a 10 plus 3 year life cycle so every

00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:07,760
major release we are doing is supported

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:10,700
for up to 13 years 10 years of general

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,660
support and three years of extended

00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:16,790
support so we are doing one major

00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:20,200
release like suse linux enterprise 11

00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:23,690
and that will be available for 10 years

00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,490
the biggest difference that we have with

00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:30,050
opensuse is we are not doing new

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,300
releases like an open source of release

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,820
but we are doing service packs those

00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:40,100
service packs can be seen as something

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:42,470
like a 31 and 32 but there is a little

00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,780
bit of a or rather the largest

00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,260
difference in terms of what we do with

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,870
the service pack with the service pack

00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:55,370
during those 10 years of life cycle we

00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,289
keep API and a bi-stable so if you

00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,720
compile an application on the first

00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,850
release of a major release you can still

00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,550
run it without the need to recompile it

00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:09,850
on the last service pack of this major

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:12,140
release so while we do new releases

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:15,260
every now and then roughly every 18

00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:18,470
months there is still the compatibility

00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:20,750
to the previous release in one major

00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,610
release family which is a little bit

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,810
different to what opensuse does with

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:29,690
every new release where every release

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:32,750
can contain breakages in terms of API

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:36,320
and ABI so if you have package that you

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,460
build on opensuse 11 dot one it might or

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:40,370
it might not run

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,340
on the 13 not one if you do the same

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:50,539
thing for suse linux enterprise it will

00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:53,539
still run in addition to that we are

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:57,470
also doing regular major releases so new

00:06:53,539 --> 00:07:00,139
major versions that every where every

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:04,280
one of them has 13 years of life cycle

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:06,590
so get 13 years for saloons Enterprise

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:08,870
11 and we are going to be releasing

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,120
Susan links Enterprise 12 that will also

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,520
be 13 years there's an overlapping

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,430
period of those major releases where you

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,530
can pick and choose much like with

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,500
opensuse releases where you have 30 not

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:28,729
one with this 18 months then there's 13

00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:31,870
or two and so on but there's also a lot

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,330
that we have in common with opensuse and

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:38,360
one of the major parts of that is

00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:42,830
building the project at the product so

00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:46,090
suse linux enterprise or opensuse is the

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:48,860
app stream for suse linux enterprise and

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:51,530
we are using the same technologies we

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,180
are using the open build servers to

00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,990
build our packages for the enterprise

00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:01,270
distribution we're using open QA to do

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:05,440
QA work all the same as with open susan

00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:08,259
we are basing on at one point in time

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,330
certain package versions certain

00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:14,539
packages itself from opensuse and are

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:22,130
creating our sizzling enterprise out of

00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:25,789
this but we are diverging at some point

00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:27,409
in time because we keep the stability we

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,900
are providing an enterprise product we

00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:34,640
need to maintain certifications so we

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:36,919
can't break API ABI at one point in time

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,620
we need to maintain this for our

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,740
customers so at some point in time we

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:46,010
are diverging away from opensuse when it

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:49,760
comes to package versions package

00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:51,410
features and so on that opensuse is

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,170
still our development

00:08:51,410 --> 00:09:00,319
form for new features and we are using

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:03,199
the same tools and I'm I borrowed a

00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:06,500
small slide from last year's session on

00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:09,439
suse linux enterprise in opensuse that

00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,629
outlines a little bit what we mean with

00:09:09,439 --> 00:09:14,300
we are diverging at some point in time

00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:17,689
with our major release so we are

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:21,589
planning for ously 12 release it's based

00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:27,350
on somewhere in between 30 not one and

00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:29,629
the to be released 30 not 13 or two we

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,689
are taking packages from opensuse we're

00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:35,300
creating our enterprise product we're

00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:37,699
giving something back to opensuse what

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,720
we did with the quality assurance

00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:44,180
testing and so on in 213 dot 2 we're

00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,329
taking some parts of 13 door to also

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,970
into this release product but we're also

00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:53,379
taking parts of 13 or two into the

00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:56,209
development of our next service pack and

00:09:53,379 --> 00:09:59,959
of course we also back that band then

00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:03,290
again returning that into opensuse but

00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:06,860
there will be a point in time maybe 14

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:09,170
dot 13 dot 3 or a service pack 2 for

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,839
suse linux enterprise 12 where we cannot

00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,899
that easily really take parts of

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,959
opensuse and create our new service pack

00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:22,250
out of this because there might be

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:24,829
upgrades to come g lipsy GCC you name it

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:27,110
that don't allow us to do that anymore

00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:36,199
because we would break something in our

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:38,059
stack and i'm way too fast so let me

00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:40,279
talk a little bit slower and let me talk

00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:42,980
a little bit more and by the way if you

00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:45,709
have any questions feel free to

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,600
interrupt me at any point in time i like

00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:52,759
to run with a microphone and i like to

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:58,970
keep the video guys busy so we are also

00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:01,189
facing common issues one of the things

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:03,800
that every open source distribution

00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:05,360
every open source project is facing that

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,360
we're all based on

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:14,510
some upstream project and this upstream

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:18,079
project might make changes that we don't

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:22,130
really like like let's say they are

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:25,040
changing the API they are making a minor

00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,200
release that is breaking backward

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,079
comfortability inside of the major

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,350
release these are problems that opensuse

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,500
is facing because then also something

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:39,410
might go wrong there and those are also

00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,810
issues that we are facing and of course

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:43,760
we are also facing them with the app our

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:47,810
upstream project we are also facing them

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,880
with opensuse opensuse makes a move we

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:54,079
also need to handle that as suse linux

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,209
enterprise and it's hard to influence

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,060
decision that are happening in the

00:11:56,209 --> 00:12:02,390
upstream project so upstream also for

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,440
opensuse and as we're talking about a

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:10,339
community a community is not all not

00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:13,490
everyone shares the same opinion so the

00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:17,060
opinions inside the communities also go

00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:19,010
from one end to the other end you got

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,870
people that don't want to change

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,070
anything some people might want to

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:26,420
change everything you need to deal and

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,290
handle with a lot of different people

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,970
that have a lot of different opinions

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:35,060
ways they want to go things they want to

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,680
do and those are all the things that we

00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,829
are also facing with suse linux

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,720
enterprise so not only with the upstream

00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:44,240
projects but we also have customers and

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,329
we have customers ranging from the ones

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,860
that need or want change immediately to

00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:53,990
the ones that let's not touch our system

00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:58,220
give us one version and support us for

00:12:53,990 --> 00:13:00,860
eternity with it but please don't do any

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,980
updates even if you promise us to don't

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:06,649
break API ABI and so on they don't want

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,300
that so what we need to deal with the

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,279
community on the one hand side on the

00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,350
upstream side we also have our customers

00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:14,350
and we're all part of the community

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:25,800
so what are the differences in total

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,960
that we have in addition to what i said

00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,570
we have the package selection that is

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,420
different and it's good that it's

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,490
different opensuse ships with i don't

00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:45,120
know how many packages maybe someone

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:47,660
here knows 7,500 okay so and SUSE Linux

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:52,290
Enterprise release shifts with roughly

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:56,130
two thousand eight hundred packages so

00:13:52,290 --> 00:14:00,000
we have a rather big difference there as

00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:02,400
well but that's also we need to pick

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,800
what our customers need what our

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,570
customers want we also need to pick what

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,450
we can support we need to pick what is

00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,580
mature enough to keep it going because

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,860
as I said we're talking about now I'm

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,050
not talking about 18 months and then we

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,660
could drop something like it is the case

00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,180
with opensuse if some project is in

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:23,940
there are some packages in there it

00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:25,590
might not be in the next release but we

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,500
can't do that with suse linux enterprise

00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:33,210
because we need to keep everything up

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:36,840
for those 13 years the life cycle has

00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:39,320
one big difference and the one where we

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,310
are diverging at some point in time

00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,430
certifications i already mentioned that

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:49,470
but another big part are also defaults

00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:53,210
that are different so defaults when it

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:58,230
comes to the desktop environment where

00:14:53,210 --> 00:15:01,010
opensuse is in a default installation

00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:03,900
installing que de souza linux enterprise

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:08,940
in a default installation is installing

00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:11,850
chrome we are different their default

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,910
file system also topic where we have

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:22,670
differences saloons enterprise is using

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:22,670
ext3 opensuse is using ext4 so

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:32,100
bachelor fast is a file system where we

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:34,980
are very interested in but it's not

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,110
default in suse linux enterprise it is

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,260
supported with suse linux enterprise and

00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,440
it's a good example for another thing

00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:46,590
and that is that opensuse is benefiting

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,780
from sizzling enterprise efforts because

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,120
if you think of batter FS and you think

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:53,640
of tools like the snapshotting tool

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,830
snapper that was developed for suse

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:59,280
linux enterprise but it was first in

00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:02,250
opensuse because opensuse shower

00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:07,470
upstream so we are putting things into

00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:10,410
opensuse tool a give back to the

00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,930
community but also of course to benefit

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,730
from someone testing it a little bit

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:18,210
more coverage on the testing side so

00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:20,220
it's not all glory to we are so good

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,590
people we are giving it to you we of

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,230
course also expecting something in

00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,400
return but things like that go to

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:31,890
opensuse first and also when it comes to

00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:35,160
patches that we developed for sizzling

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:38,160
zenterprise they also in many cases go

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,670
to opensuse either first or at least

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:50,190
once they go to suse linux enterprise i

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:52,350
will run to you Michael the question is

00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:54,920
if sleet 12 will be using XD 3 by

00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,780
default and I can't tell you what

00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:08,000
default sizzling enterprise 12 will have

00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:10,980
at this point in time sorry Yas ok but

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,360
you could make some educated guesses on

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:18,060
what the defaults will be in suse linux

00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:19,350
enterprise 12 another difference and i

00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,490
already talked about the hardware

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:27,120
certification stuff but it's also QA we

00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:32,480
have people that we pay to do in QA like

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:36,060
Richard he's one of our QA guys and

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:38,310
we're doing this QA to ensure that we

00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:41,250
have the enterprise quality for the

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:44,730
product but we are also getting partner

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,920
QA on suse linux enterprise what is

00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,570
partner q i mean i talked about the

00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,670
highway certification so we are working

00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:54,510
together with all major hardware

00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:56,490
partners to ensure that our susan looks

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:58,490
enterprise distribution runs on their

00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,710
hardware why are we doing this

00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:04,170
specifically most of the hardware

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:06,480
vendors put their patches upstream into

00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:12,110
the Linux kernel so if you are running

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:15,060
on a late or a more recent Linux kernel

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,790
your hardware will run no issues with

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,740
that this applies to basically all

00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,480
laptops that you buy the patches are

00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,090
upstream if you have a recent kernel

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,990
version then you should have almost no

00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:30,150
hardware issues but we are not using the

00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,820
latest Linux kernel with suse linux

00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:35,310
enterprise we are back porting drivers

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:38,460
to the kernel version that we are

00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:41,550
shipping like with susan's enterprise 11

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:45,930
we're still at a kernel version that

00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:48,420
weeds 3 dot 0 am currently I think it's

00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:50,430
312 or something like that so there are

00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,590
quite some releases in between that

00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:55,260
happen for the linux com and when new

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:57,570
features came in but we're back parting

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,780
those drivers specifically but also

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:03,150
features and functionality to this older

00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,580
base while maintaining this api and api

00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:10,230
stability and for that we also need

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:12,390
partners to do testing another quite big

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,420
difference and i'm currently competing

00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:19,430
with this multi arch track is the

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:23,100
architectures that are supported or that

00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:25,620
there are is the distribution is

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:27,210
available for there is also a difference

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,190
between opensuse and suse linux

00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:38,370
enterprise who of you has a power

00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:39,990
machine at home Wow impressive typically

00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:41,850
no one raises the hand but now I got a

00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:44,880
question that I hope really no one

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:47,120
raises their hand who has a system z at

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,120
home

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:57,979
at home really so those are two

00:19:55,099 --> 00:20:00,739
architectures where sizzling enterprise

00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:03,259
is available for but opensuse is not

00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:08,149
available for at least not that I would

00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:11,749
know of so obviously because no one has

00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:15,799
an IBM system z in his basement unless

00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:17,359
you really has too much money so they

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:21,409
are only at corporations they are only

00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:23,749
at enterprises and those want support

00:20:21,409 --> 00:20:27,279
for their systems so they go with suse

00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:29,869
linux enterprise on the other hand

00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:32,690
there's our also architectures where

00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:35,450
opensuse is built for but salutes

00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:40,669
enterprise is not available for I'm

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:46,639
competing with the arm yeah I was kernel

00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:49,969
space SMP on arm track as well and arm

00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:55,039
is something where opensuse is available

00:20:49,969 --> 00:20:57,830
for you can get images for arm CPUs for

00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:01,549
opensuse but you can currently not get

00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:04,989
Susan's enterprise on now because that's

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:07,309
again nothing for the enterprise yet arm

00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:11,239
there are no real armed service

00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:13,849
available there is no need for us as a

00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:16,129
company to provide a product for this

00:21:13,849 --> 00:21:21,019
architecture but we are supporting the

00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:27,409
community with doing a port of opensuse

00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:28,999
to arm so after the differences what is

00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:31,909
left and I think I covered almost

00:21:28,999 --> 00:21:37,039
anything of that list as well already

00:21:31,909 --> 00:21:40,669
for opensuse there is back fixing also

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,580
additional testing that opensuse

00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:45,919
receives from Sue's Alex enterprise

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:49,099
development of specific things that we

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:51,889
are doing as soon as company in opensuse

00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:55,220
I talked about snapper so suse linux

00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:57,799
enterprise features but also just as the

00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,200
system and management tool that we have

00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,090
we provide funding

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:04,669
or people to come to the opensuse

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:09,559
conference for example we sponsor the

00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:12,740
opensuse conference and we also have a

00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:16,549
lot of packages that we employ that are

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:19,580
building packages for opensuse what do

00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:22,639
we get we get a stable basis for our

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:24,679
development and we basically also get

00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:28,190
the development environment for most of

00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,889
our engineers we also get packaging

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:33,200
because we also take packages that the

00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:36,679
community build and integrate them into

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,230
our product and we have an easy way to

00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:42,080
work together with upstream with

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,990
upstream projects like the Linux kernel

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,360
or the desktop environments and so on

00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:51,260
where we have an easy way to talk to

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:54,350
them via opensuse as the project where

00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:57,159
we can be closer to upstream then we

00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:00,649
might be with suse linux enterprise and

00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:02,870
last but not least as we are having the

00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:05,510
same tools on opensuse and SUSE Linux

00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:12,590
Enterprise we also get familiarity with

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:17,870
the suze ecosystem but one thing is very

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:20,870
important and that is that opensuse is a

00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:25,100
project and suse linux enterprise is a

00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:26,659
product so while we have something in

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,529
common there are a lot of differences

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:32,990
but you really can't compare the two in

00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:35,480
a good way because we got the community

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:40,639
project where the community can

00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:43,700
basically do what they want now the

00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:46,010
community contains a lot of Susan

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,190
employees and since is paying a lot of

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,730
people to work in the opensuse community

00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:55,909
so there might be a glitch to it because

00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,000
in every community the one who does

00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:00,860
something is the one who points into a

00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,610
direction and maybe also moves

00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:07,039
everything into that direction sizzling

00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:10,460
zenterprise on the other hand is a

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,440
product and with the product we define

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,200
what is going in there when you find

00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,470
what is needed

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:22,429
we are making basically the rules for it

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:25,220
and now I'm really really way too fast

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:29,960
and did say less than I expected me to

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:32,239
say but now to the fun part to the

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,340
interactive part now it's the time to

00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:39,649
ask almost anything you ever wanted to

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:49,369
know from isuzu product manager and no

00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:52,729
one wants to know anything so in your

00:24:49,369 --> 00:24:55,129
slides few slides beer before you

00:24:52,729 --> 00:24:59,419
mention that most of the development

00:24:55,129 --> 00:25:01,879
goes to the opens use project right so

00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:04,759
how does this help you differentiate

00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:07,279
your product I mean if I get all the new

00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:11,299
development in the open source project

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,849
why would I buy shoes enterprise that's

00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:18,739
a very good question but I mean that's

00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:21,259
the question on why do I buy an open

00:25:18,739 --> 00:25:23,029
source project or what do I buy if I buy

00:25:21,259 --> 00:25:27,259
something that is based on open source

00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:29,629
because all of our development happens

00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:31,940
in the open we have a very strict rule

00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:34,789
and we only break it at four very

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,470
specific and good reasons and that is

00:25:34,789 --> 00:25:39,080
everything that goes into the suse linux

00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:41,840
enterprise product needs to be open

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,659
source this specifically applies to

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,090
drivers for hardware and so on where

00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:50,229
everything needs to be open source so

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:52,609
there is no real differentiator between

00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:55,759
different enterprise distributions

00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:57,950
because all could be the same feature

00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,749
and functionality wise now there are

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,879
differences in the release life cycle

00:25:59,749 --> 00:26:06,049
and so on and of course you could go

00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:08,749
with opens uzum but there's a little bit

00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:14,899
of a cavy there and that is if you go

00:26:08,749 --> 00:26:17,119
for opensuse or any other unpaid linux

00:26:14,899 --> 00:26:19,759
distribution you have a very specific

00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,309
life cycle like without consulting a

00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:25,749
teen months after those 18 month you

00:26:22,309 --> 00:26:25,749
need to migrate your system

00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:30,539
during that migration your application

00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:33,960
that you are running on top of it might

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:36,240
break so this gives you a little bit of

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,649
a down time that's nothing that you

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,629
really want to do at least when you're

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:43,559
in an enterprise on a mission critical

00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:46,769
environment that's why we say we keep

00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:49,259
the API and a bi-stable so you can

00:26:46,769 --> 00:26:52,110
migrate from one service pack to the

00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:55,970
next service pack without the fear of

00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:59,360
this interruption the other thing is you

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:03,119
buy support from us you are not buying

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,869
the code you're getting support and you

00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:12,450
get guarantees for fixes for security

00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:15,119
fixes and that's why you buy suse linux

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:18,269
enterprise and security fixes are a good

00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,690
example I think it never happened but

00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:24,269
theoretically as it's all open source

00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:28,919
there might be an issue and you can

00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:32,429
report this issue for package XYZ and no

00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:33,929
one cares so no one is fixing your issue

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:39,059
if this is critical to your business

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:40,860
that's an issue with us if it's a part

00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:42,600
of our product and that's why I

00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,340
mentioned this rather largest

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,169
differences difference when it comes to

00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,240
package size and package selection

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:50,970
because we really pick where we know we

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,129
can support and we can provide fixes we

00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:55,110
can provide security fixes for it if

00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:57,240
there is an issue as i said this

00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:59,340
basically never has happened but a

00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,139
security fix could also mean you need to

00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:03,119
upgrade to something that breaks again

00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:05,899
something and then there's the

00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:11,490
certification area if you are running

00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:14,059
let's pick my by best example let's say

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:16,409
you are running an essay p application

00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,879
you want to make sure that it's running

00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:21,330
on this on the distribution on the

00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:24,960
system that you have there we have the

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:27,720
certification as AP will most likely not

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,659
certify any unpaid linux distributions

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:32,490
because they are changing too fast we

00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,610
are having a new major release every

00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:37,890
roughly five years and we have ten years

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,540
of stability so

00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:42,060
there's not really much effort to

00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:47,450
certifying something on the distribution

00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:59,850
and that's what Susan's enterprises for

00:28:47,450 --> 00:29:02,610
any more questions and there's been a

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:09,360
bunch of discussion I've seen recently

00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:11,910
on the idea of creating a caesar linux

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,330
enterprise oriented distribution that

00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:19,680
has free updates for all that in such a

00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:22,410
way that would popularize it and make it

00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:26,490
more accessible for developers and

00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:30,510
hackers and so on in an inner possibly

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:33,840
similar way to other competitor

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:40,050
distributions out there that might be

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:42,840
based on enterprise code sent us but the

00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:44,450
thing is I mean I've heard I was kind of

00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,310
reluctant to bring census up because

00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,690
I've heard suggestions that kind of lean

00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:50,250
in that direction but actually take a

00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,560
completely fresh take on it as well I

00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,180
was wondering if you could maybe

00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:56,580
summarize the current thinking on that

00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,800
or like say a bit more about the the

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,300
ideas that are out there and maybe what

00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:06,780
is the likelihood of any of these things

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:08,820
actually happening so I can't say what's

00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,220
the likelihood for ideas that are out

00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:16,710
there I can't say what is happening

00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:19,080
because I don't know so yes there are

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,810
ideas out there for that specific

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:28,020
purpose and yes this is something that

00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:30,140
we're really considering because we we

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:33,810
need to realize that a lot of

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:36,300
development efforts from contributors

00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:39,230
for some upstream projects is not

00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:44,340
happening on either sizzling zenterprise

00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:46,920
nor opensuse unfortunately so this is of

00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,930
course something that we want to address

00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,640
and that we need to address from a

00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,539
sizzling enterprise perspective because

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,369
at one point

00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:56,609
time we might end up with not having

00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:58,529
those 9000 certified applications

00:30:56,609 --> 00:31:00,869
anymore because everyone is developing

00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:07,799
on other platforms and it's not caring

00:31:00,869 --> 00:31:09,779
to port to our platform there is a gap

00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:13,289
between opensuse and suse linux

00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:15,739
enterprise when it comes to life cycle

00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:20,729
when it comes to covering specific

00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:24,830
functionality with specific use case

00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:28,229
scenarios that some users might have and

00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:32,580
we are thinking about different ways to

00:31:28,229 --> 00:31:35,759
do that so either putting something in

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:39,210
between the two for whatever that might

00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,700
be or pushing something from sizzling

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:44,729
center price a little bit more down into

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:47,460
the direction of opens or pushing

00:31:44,729 --> 00:31:49,229
opensuse a little bit more into the

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:55,590
direction of sizzling enterprise to

00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:58,440
close this gap we don't know what we

00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:03,029
will do and with we this means the

00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:06,149
community not really Susan that of

00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:10,279
course Sousa as part of the community so

00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:12,929
if you have any good idea what you think

00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:16,799
might be a solution to that or what

00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:20,970
might be a good thing to do for the

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,529
community for us I'm sure that we want

00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:24,960
to know about and then we want to talk

00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:28,769
about it we want to see what we can do

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:33,840
we are definitely supportive for ideas

00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:35,690
how to improve this situation we are

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,239
talking a lot about this but there's no

00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:43,769
certain way how we want to approach it

00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:46,249
at this point in time any other

00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:46,249
questions

00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:56,539
nothing really hmm and I was really too

00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:04,910
quick i should have gone for the 45

00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:06,620
minute slot Oh Michael thank you so we

00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,760
talked about the value Inslee which I'm

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:10,580
sure there's a lot of we didn't talk

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,610
about price and upsell so you know sell

00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:15,679
me a beautiful sleeve with some amazing

00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:25,150
support package what what can i buy from

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:28,970
you on why should I I'm not in sales but

00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:30,830
yet every once in sales so what you can

00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:34,190
buy from us are different support levels

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:37,610
you can buy basic support which is just

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,650
covering maintenance update that's what

00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:42,620
you might want if you really just need

00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:46,270
the life cycle of the product we are

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:50,240
offering a standard support which is a

00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:53,750
five by 12 Support Package so five days

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,390
a week 12 hours time window depending on

00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:59,570
the time zone that you're in so it's not

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:02,510
12 hours starting seven a.m. central

00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:05,299
european time and adding 7 p.m. central

00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:08,270
european time but it's 12 hours

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:11,600
depending on where you are where you can

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:14,359
call our support and you will get help

00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,409
with the issues you are facing you will

00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:20,659
get PDF so package fixes for issues

00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:23,960
you've encountered but it will also get

00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:26,869
configuration support and so on then

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,720
there's priority support which is 24 by

00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:31,639
7 so follow the Sun service desk

00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,730
whenever you have an issue you can call

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,669
you can open a ticket and someone will

00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,560
help you they come with different SLA s

00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:42,290
in terms of response times and so on

00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:48,520
don't ask me what they are I would need

00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:51,379
to look it up and in terms of pricing

00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,869
that's very complicated matter but you

00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:56,839
can look on our webpage on Susan calm /

00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:59,570
products / either server or desktop and

00:34:56,839 --> 00:35:01,230
there is a how-to by section that covers

00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:05,060
that part pretty well

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,060
because I can only tell you one price

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:19,350
any other questions Michael yeah sure as

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,340
I said anything you ever wanted to know

00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:24,840
from misuzu p.m. see it seems to me that

00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:28,080
there's a balance between how much you

00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,980
give away to build the community and mm

00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,480
you know if you give away everything

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,010
obviously doing any money to fund them

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,810
development so you go bust if you give

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,690
everything away and potentially give

00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:38,790
bust if you give nothing away what data

00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:41,670
do you have to inform the decision in

00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:45,330
between of how much you give away is it

00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:48,420
a finger in the air is it looking at

00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:51,000
what competitors do it how what possible

00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:57,660
basis can you make good numero decisions

00:35:51,000 --> 00:36:02,390
that it's magic that's a very good

00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:05,369
question um so when it comes to features

00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:09,240
functionality code that we provide into

00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:10,260
opensuse and into upstream projects it's

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,960
something that we need for our

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,020
enterprise product so we have customer

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,480
demand partner demand for it so in order

00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,160
to make money we need to develop it so

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,450
we are giving it back to the community

00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:28,170
because it's open source so we give it

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:30,450
away when it comes to funding people to

00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:32,250
travel to the opensuse conference when

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:34,920
it comes to sponsoring the opensuse

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,800
conference or other events and so on I'm

00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,930
sure there are certain measures that we

00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,070
take into account how much money being

00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:48,150
west into that I don't know how this is

00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:50,520
actually done I'm also not sure that I

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:54,150
really want to know what black magic is

00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,750
hidden behind that but I'm sure that we

00:36:54,150 --> 00:37:00,510
take certain measures let's say okay we

00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:03,780
can put that much money into the open

00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:07,800
source project and we do gain a lot from

00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,420
the open source project so i don't have

00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:13,010
the feeling that we are leaving money on

00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,850
the table by investing into opensuse or

00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:22,980
by paying

00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:26,220
ployees to work on opensuse anything

00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:30,080
else you want to know doesn't need to be

00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,080
related to what I talked about ah

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,980
finally it works you just have to keep

00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:43,140
asking people to ask questions and

00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:46,230
someone will come up with one yeah you

00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:51,870
mentioned you want to keep ABI and API

00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:54,420
stability in sleep and does that mean

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:58,410
that you won't allow extensions to the

00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,900
API or bi or do you allow extensions nut

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:03,180
removal so that do allow compatible

00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:08,310
change but not incompatible or is it a

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:11,730
strict no changes policy I think it

00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:17,250
would be impossible to enforce the no

00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:20,670
changes policy so when it comes to not

00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:23,730
changing API and ABI this means the

00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:26,630
existing API and ABI needs to remain

00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,460
unchanged so if you have a function call

00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:32,100
that in some newer version gets an

00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:35,010
additional parameter that's not possible

00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:38,160
unless there is a default for this

00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:41,310
parameter so unless you can call another

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,780
function that still accepts the old

00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:45,900
amount of arguments and it's still

00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:50,160
functioning in the same way if there is

00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:52,260
a new API or ABI call available that can

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,170
be added that's not an issue because

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,300
this won't break anything but it will

00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:59,600
provide something in addition and that's

00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,830
fine and that's what we do a lot and

00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:05,070
that's also what happens with new

00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,840
drivers new features when it comes to

00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:09,900
power management or things like that

00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,690
that go on the Linux kernel that add new

00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,120
functionality that's of course nothing

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,550
that we want to prohibit and there are

00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:20,370
certain applications from ice vs that

00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:22,530
require specific service pack levels to

00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:27,170
run because they rely on some of the

00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:27,170
newer API and ABI that is available

00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:40,380
any other questions no in this case

00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:48,300
thanks a lot and you just gotta received

00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:48,300
