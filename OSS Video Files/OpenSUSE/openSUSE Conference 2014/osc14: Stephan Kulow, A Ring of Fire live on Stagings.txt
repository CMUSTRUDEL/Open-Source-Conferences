Title: osc14: Stephan Kulow, A Ring of Fire live on Stagings
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	In this talk I want to present what tools our team worked on to improve the development process of openSUSE:Factory
to get higher quality for openSUSE. The development process of Factory is actually the development process of openSUSE,
so it's of high importance and a lot of things changed since my last openSUSE conference presentation and still a lot of things
are planned to change.

The proposal of the new workflow was posted to the factory mailing list November 2013: http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-factory/2013-11/msg00920.html
and this talk is about the changes derived from it.
