	00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:12,420

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,210
anyone see I flying key kohat nobody

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:21,840
sees a flying key kohat god damn it I

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:24,180
mean oh my how bad you know and that

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,650
just won the LibreOffice guy who is

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,539
totally responsible for anything that

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,030
goes wrong with this application walks

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:37,350
out of the room should go beat him up

00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:41,879
give me a sec I'll start this again yeah

00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,250
five yeah that's a clock and then I

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,500
start flying geek go ahead no flying

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,140
kiko hats I'm gonna tell Michael make

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,840
something okay let me introduce myself

00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,670
these cute girls are respectively my

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,239
wife and my dog I'm sure you can guess

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:59,190
which one is which the dog is popcorn

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,680
the wife is Camilla cease from Brazil

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,120
and you will be able to see her in real

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,799
life tomorrow because he's going to give

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,900
a ruby on rails workshop we all three of

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,549
us live in Berlin although only popcorn

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,500
is a native I work for on clouds as

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:19,350
community manager where I do stuff like

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,630
talk to people and write which is

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:24,390
essentially the same except via usually

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,479
computer screen and I try and take care

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,299
of community stuff like our up and

00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,619
coming hopefully local meter program and

00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:39,979
conference and things like that so let's

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:44,520
talk about boots No ah there's the Kiko

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:46,470
mm-hmm okay well that's right I used to

00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,079
work for Susan as some of you might

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,720
FEGLI remember as community manager

00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,850
hence the geek oh but apparently I had

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,430
to click first before it again all right

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,560
my mistake so let's talk about boots and

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,780
you know those things that you do at

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,149
events and to tell people about the

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,799
events so I have three main subjects for

00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:11,400
this talk none of which are kittens I'm

00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,710
sorry I just have the picture so the

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:17,700
first subject will be why you do

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,680
in the first place second how to do both

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:24,720
that's where the promise tips come in

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,300
and hurt actually this one isn't going

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,390
to happen at all so just going to be two

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,400
kittens I mean subjects easy enough I

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,750
need to fix that so why do you do both

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,120
well obviously because you want to

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,500
present your project will have a project

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:48,500
that is now you have three targets for

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:51,150
both the newbies advanced users and

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:52,710
experience free software people those

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:56,040
are the three kind of people you try and

00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:59,130
target now for the newbies the beginners

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,240
you simply want to put opensuse in front

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:06,120
of them and you just want them to try it

00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,250
play with it hopefully you know take it

00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:14,070
home use it install it on those systems

00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:16,140
etc so you just demonstrate it you talk

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,760
about it may be given a flyer explain to

00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,650
them what it is why they should use it

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,700
etc you have talking point for that or

00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:25,230
you should for the advanced users things

00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,180
are a little bit different they probably

00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,800
already use Linux might be opensuse

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,040
might be another linux and they often

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,320
come to booth to ask questions why did

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,930
you do this system d thing would be

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,940
rather typical one in the last year or

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:44,340
so how do i do x why is there no

00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,870
application Z this is the kind of stuff

00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,660
the kind of questions you get and that

00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,610
you need to be able to answer usually if

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,010
you're a reasonably experienced episodes

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,220
user in your follow planet opensuse and

00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:58,740
the opposite news you can answer 99% of

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,110
these questions so it's not something to

00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,180
be worried about this is why they come

00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,450
right and you're there to help them with

00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:09,720
this obviously if they don't yet use

00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:12,620
opensuse make them right convince them

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,240
that it's good that it's worth trying

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,480
the last group of people are the hackers

00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,310
the people already do free software and

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,740
you know people who already contribute

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,770
to something like debian org and to for

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:31,650
example or who work on gnome or KDE or

00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:34,530
our other projects for them well you

00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,000
just you dare mostly to be there I mean

00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:38,190
you're not going to convince the Debian

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,270
contributor to start using opensuse at

00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:43,919
least unlikely honestly trying is just I

00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,539
mean these are the kind of people who

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,430
can figure about themselves whether i

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,639
should use something or not right there

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,129
they know enough if they're using Debian

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,020
I don't think you have arguments that

00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:57,300
would convince them to use opensuse

00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,759
because they probably thought about it

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,650
more than you will be able to go through

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,860
and at five minutes you have talking to

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:06,659
them anyway so instead you need to

00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,180
simply show them that opensuse is there

00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:12,419
it's relevant and why it would be

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,770
interesting for people not them because

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,690
these are the kind of people who talk

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,780
about other people and other people at

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,819
least if they're smart listen to them so

00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,879
they're influencers there are people you

00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:26,039
need to make sure that realize that open

00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:28,770
suse is still relevant that it's a good

00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,389
distro for you know that grandfather who

00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,849
might not be that interested in running

00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:36,449
into and that's usually something they

00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:39,539
realize just fine so for them it's still

00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:42,750
quite relevant that opensuse exists and

00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:44,520
you just need to make that clear and of

00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,289
course there's another side to what we

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,940
do in offices we do a lot of Nome

00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:51,060
dissolution things and the open build

00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,009
service open QA and these kind of tools

00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,560
are very relevant even for people who do

00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,300
not use opensuse I mean if you're a

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,729
debian developer you can probably build

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,009
Debian packages just fine you don't need

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,110
the open field service but if you're a

00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:07,199
developer for an independent application

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:09,270
like say inkscape and you want packages

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,580
for your distribution to come out timely

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,830
after the release your bill service is

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,199
actually very interesting so even when

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,539
you can't sell opensuse as a district to

00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:20,610
use for these people well they will

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:23,310
bloody well be interested in using your

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,440
bill service or open QA which can also

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:26,849
test again hell it can even test windows

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,090
so that's relevant for pretty much

00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:33,300
anyone who does distribution work and so

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,889
there's more to opensuse than just a

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,900
distro and this is something that's

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:43,050
especially relevant for this audience

00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,240
that's why the goal in the audience now

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:48,900
let's talk a little bit about how to do

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,789
this constructing a booth yeah now I'm

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,039
going to start with the basics having an

00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:55,410
open space and representing open tools

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,190
as a project properly and that all

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:01,169
sterile share a couple of tips now first

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,759
thing that I think is really important

00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:05,070
but I'll pursue this to be open and

00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,900
welcoming we're free source of project

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:11,490
and and you know free that's that that's

00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:14,970
a happy thing that's something you know

00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:17,250
a passion is what brings us together yet

00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:19,110
it's not just the technology I mean as I

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,580
usually put it this way you know yes

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,650
technology is something that attracts

00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,199
people but in the end they stay for

00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:27,030
other people I all these people who

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,360
think that you know the nerds are the

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:32,729
opensuse conference just do this because

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,280
it's for technology you're wrong okay

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,830
ask anyone here they will tell you they

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,590
come here again and again because people

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,880
people people and maybe the parties in

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,760
the beer because you know they can be

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,979
good to occasionally so it's a social

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,650
side of things that's important I say

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:52,620
free hugs for everyone but not everyone

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,330
likes acts too much and it's about this

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,760
opening and being welcoming your booth

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:58,199
should represent this not just in what

00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,000
you say to people what you show them

00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:03,900
what you tell them but even in the way

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,789
it's laid out in my opinion especially

00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,620
for newbies this is important i mean the

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:09,659
experts then I'll free software but new

00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,030
base downs now this this is a

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:14,580
traditional booth okay you have a table

00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,789
between you and visitors that's not

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,909
terribly open is it so what you should

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:23,970
do is this and this is Linux west

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:26,070
northwest and three years ago I think

00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,039
with Brandon standing here in the middle

00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:31,110
he's opus was a guy currently actually

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,060
the Linux west northwest is happening

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,490
again which is at the same day as user

00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,959
conference very unfortunately because

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,349
that means some cool people cannot be

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,419
here and well we can't be there but

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,330
linux west-northwest OS has had a very

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:50,120
good opensuse both in part because brian

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,120
and brendan took care of it

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,570
the idea here as you see is you put all

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,740
the stuff to the side so that you

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,950
actually have a space in the middle

00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:01,160
where people can come and ask questions

00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:04,190
so you create a much more open

00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,840
atmosphere basically from the get-go

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:08,130
instead of this this wall between you

00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,600
and the visitors and it's a very simple

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:12,660
thing but it makes a lot of difference

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,160
for a booth and really even if you come

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,630
to a conference and you see that they

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,030
have prepared all the tables and they

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,620
put them all in a row they won't mind if

00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:21,900
you grab the table and put it behind you

00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,250
and you'll have a pretty special booth

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,290
that way right because you'll be the

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:30,630
only project that has it which is pretty

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:32,190
nice too it's simple but it works well

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,290
we have good artwork for the booth I

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:36,090
usually give a tip about not making a

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,620
mess of 20 different things but that's

00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:43,530
not necessary anymore because we now

00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:45,090
have proper artwork so this is a booth

00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:47,730
that linux tack and it's the same way I

00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,230
put the tables in the corner and you

00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,120
know even made a little presentation

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,250
area which comes to another tip that

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,760
we'll talk about later giving

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:58,860
presentations at your booth but if you

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,890
have no choice but to sit behind the

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,570
table at least make sure especially when

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:05,160
it's quiet that you get one of the team

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,240
members to stand in front of the booth

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,250
and because what you create then nobody

00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,230
wants to be first it's a very simple

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,970
trick but nobody wants to be first so if

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,920
there's nobody around at the booth and

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,500
one of the two people standing in front

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,180
and for somebody walking by it seems

00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,910
there's already somebody else asking

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,680
questions they can easily join it's a

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,510
really simple psychological trick but it

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,220
works very well you will notice a lot

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,920
more people ask questions if somebody's

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,300
already asking questions so play it that

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,070
one of the team members stand on the

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:38,910
other side and then people will join a

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,560
lot easier and the thing you shouldn't

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,880
do which is what the own cloud people

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,310
here in the back are doing they are

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,630
hacking at the booth don't okay if you

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,060
want to sit behind your computer and

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,860
check your email fine not that booth go

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,290
sit somewhere else sit in a conference

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:53,640
room in our people giving presentations

00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,250
because nobody minds that you're not

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,720
watching or do it in a hackerspace if

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,410
you have it but don't do it at the booth

00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,590
it's just it's bad form it's bad don't

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,590
do it

00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:11,499
we made that mistake too obviously so

00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:13,479
hacking at the booth and there's a bit

00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:16,119
of that packing going on here too it's

00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:20,409
it's a bad thing all right find the heck

00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:22,299
space for that now about the setup of

00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:24,459
the booth which you've just finished but

00:11:22,299 --> 00:11:26,409
now let's talk about representing your

00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:27,999
project and again I'm going to talk

00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:30,279
about our Pazuzu here this being the

00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:35,769
absolute conference so you represent the

00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:37,059
geek oh yeah now that is being as i said

00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,189
earlier already it's also about

00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:41,649
spreading culture right trying to spread

00:11:39,189 --> 00:11:43,299
the idea of open and free software also

00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,459
by the way you do the booth but

00:11:43,299 --> 00:11:46,779
obviously also what you tell people so

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:50,799
you need to know what the open source

00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:52,689
project is about and we have a nice set

00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,359
of posters that actually give some of

00:11:52,689 --> 00:11:59,079
that idea I think a really important one

00:11:55,359 --> 00:12:02,919
is this text is now put on that cube

00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:04,989
thingy but this this tex give a pretty

00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,149
good idea of basically the basics of how

00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:08,379
we think about the world and this is

00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:11,139
something you need to explain to people

00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:12,639
i mean you need obviously it depends on

00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:15,459
who you're talking to but especially the

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,739
more advanced users they care about this

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,959
the philosophy of a project at the home

00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:21,669
users the end users the beginners they

00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,169
just care about something that works and

00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:25,629
whether it will play their mp3 files

00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:28,959
which is fine explaining that it works

00:12:25,629 --> 00:12:30,819
and how a move on before more advanced

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,369
users they care about the philosophy of

00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:34,539
the project and this slide I think gives

00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:37,479
a pretty good idea of that philosophy

00:12:34,539 --> 00:12:39,879
right we're the kind of distro that

00:12:37,479 --> 00:12:42,459
cares about letting people do what they

00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:44,499
want to do we're a project where people

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:46,479
share what they're doing and work

00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:48,699
together with other people there were a

00:12:46,479 --> 00:12:50,439
project where you know we work with

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:53,889
other projects outside of our projects

00:12:50,439 --> 00:12:55,720
and this is stuff you can also bring to

00:12:53,889 --> 00:13:01,119
life in practice for example the next

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,549
act two years ago Fedora did their beefy

00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:05,619
miracle release so we work together with

00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,049
fedora and they provided hot dogs and we

00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:10,899
provided beer there was a pretty

00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:12,609
successful you know action obviously we

00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,450
both got a lot of visitors who are

00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:18,510
interested in well beer and hot dogs

00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:20,700
and I mean why not why not work at our

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,070
projects that's cool if if you have a

00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,370
booth another project doesn't because

00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:28,500
there weren't enough spaces maybe share

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,630
the booth you know there's really

00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,070
nothing wrong with that and I think it's

00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,840
one of the things that makes open suse a

00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:39,090
little more cool than the other projects

00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:40,350
to be honest so yeah now the second

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:42,510
thing you need to know of course other

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,610
than that the philosophy of our project

00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,290
is our technology what we do right i

00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:48,090
mean after all that's kind of what your

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,100
dare to tell people about so you need to

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:51,930
know our cool projects and that's where

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,180
these folders and flyers come in very

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:56,550
well there is the one that says what's

00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,130
cool about opensuse and this is a really

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,350
good start for a conversation because it

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:03,930
talks exactly about those things the

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:06,240
open build service oak QA and of course

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,250
there's a studio that are really really

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,260
cool about opensuse outside of our

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,560
distribution well it doesn't talk about

00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,270
our tools like yest and super and they

00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,340
are good and they are definitely worth

00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,990
talking about so it's helpful if you

00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:20,490
know a little bit about a technological

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,890
side of the project you're representing

00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:25,170
and a lot of this information is

00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:28,230
available online and we actually have

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:31,440
specific wiki pages for people at a

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,960
booth with points to talk about with

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,910
arguments why zipper versus advocates

00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,800
and different tools compared between

00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,600
districts so we have this information

00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,160
and if you're thinking about

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,010
representing another project which

00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,440
doesn't have that information get it put

00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:48,420
it together talk to people ask people

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,180
and get this information on a piece of

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:54,210
paper with you because I have seen

00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,730
people who knew nothing about well in

00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:59,580
this case it was KD and we gave him one

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:01,050
a4 with talking points and they had

00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:03,330
enough to talk about for the whole day

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:05,190
to everyone because the point is of

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,950
course most of the visitors no way less

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:10,170
than you do and one a4 of talking points

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,880
probably does a trick already and you'll

00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,130
be able to have good conversations and

00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,290
if they go too far you just refer to one

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:17,340
of the other people at the booth you

00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,080
don't need to know everything about

00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,570
opensuse to be able to represent

00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,400
opensuse at the booth you just need to

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,800
know more than the people walking by

00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,860
that's not so hard you'd be surprised

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:31,480
how little most people know

00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:35,329
about linux and general open source so

00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,980
again figure out a little bit about this

00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:43,610
and ask questions about it from other

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:45,200
people now the tips the cooler tips so

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,209
let's talk a little bit about the actual

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,339
talking I already talked about being

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:52,579
open and maybe surprise hugging people

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:54,440
and stuff like that but how do you get

00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:58,220
someone to actually talk to you at a

00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,190
booth now big trick here is ask

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,440
questions right you just start with i

00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,690
mean do you use linux what do you use

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,459
have you ever try to opensuse you know

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,100
do you like it what applications do you

00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:12,709
use these kind of things make people

00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,839
tell you their story which is all always

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,060
a good connection and at that point

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,880
don't try to have standard sales pitch

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,910
but who can do the things they say right

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,649
if they use or if they use

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,050
photoshop let's put it that way then

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,779
talk about on opensuse or about if

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:31,519
they do painting in well I don't even

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,079
know windows painting applications but

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:38,360
you can talk about critic because that's

00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:40,640
really cool so keep asking until you

00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,699
find something that that helps them

00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,529
right I mean most people have rusty if

00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:48,589
they're adding software conference they

00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:51,320
have something that bothers them I'm

00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,810
sure about either their current system

00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,680
Windows Mac whatever they're using or

00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:00,079
Linux of course find what motivates the

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,910
more might motivate them to switch and

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,410
if you can't find anything well are you

00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:05,780
probably not going to convince them

00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,540
anyway so tell them open suse is awesome

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,459
give them shake their hands and let them

00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,319
move on right there's nothing you can do

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,299
for them I mean it's perfectly fine if

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,549
someone is looking for a operating

00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:18,980
system where it can compile everything

00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:20,689
yourself don't try to convince it to

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,449
user because tell them to go to the gun

00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:24,919
to booth I mean there's no point selling

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,199
something to people if we don't actually

00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:28,850
offer what they're looking for so just

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,429
be honest and you know give them

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:32,450
obviously reasons to use our Pazuzu but

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,940
there's there's nothing if there's

00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,630
nothing then there's nothing so be it

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,250
that's cool that's fine and last point

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,860
here is don't waste time on negativity

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:44,500
you see a lot that

00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:46,059
we'll come and start to complain now I

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,429
get that and people need to vent

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:51,610
sometimes and it's okay to to let them

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:53,290
vent and just give him a minute but

00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:54,730
don't spend a lot of time on it I mean

00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:56,290
you're not going to be able to solve

00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,770
that problem there on the spot i'm

00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:02,470
pretty sure so don't spend too much time

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,330
on it tell them to send an email go up

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,260
to the forums and ask their something

00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,880
like that and just move on okay it's you

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,380
can spend the whole day with one

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,360
complainant person but you could have

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,000
gotten ten happy new users in the time

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,340
so don't don't spend too much time on

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,260
that bad for your motivation it's bad

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,260
for the people are listening to it to

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:29,799
the conversation and it doesn't help the

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:33,100
other person anyway last tip you might

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,809
want to try listening is important

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,280
people like to be listened to I mean

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:39,220
that's why I said start with asking

00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,780
questions and the trick projects have

00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:45,520
tried in the past that can work really

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:47,169
well is to have a ideas wall or

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,950
something like that if you have room at

00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:54,280
your booth you know hang up a big white

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:57,490
piece of paper put some post-its and let

00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,580
people write ideas or feedback from on

00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,410
the post-it and at the end of the day or

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,270
the end of the conference you know

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:06,760
collect it and email it to the opensuse

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:10,510
project mailing list I can't exactly

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:13,299
guarantee all or even any of it might go

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:14,799
anywhere but hey you might have given

00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:16,360
all the people who wrote something down

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:23,540
a better feeling which in itself is

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:27,120
worth while already so

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:30,210
another cool tip this is an example of

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,650
what we did at lenox tak there's no year

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,210
on that but it's a couple of years ago

00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:35,010
oh yeah this year that we work together

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:40,710
with the door as you can see all the

00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:46,350
sticker there's well there should be you

00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:50,040
know whole dog on top and beer so one

00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:51,600
tip if you have giveaways obviously you

00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:54,420
know try to do something like a lottery

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,940
or it depends a bit on what you have at

00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,990
some suits we have these big egos

00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:04,370
they're like this really big and then

00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,870
obviously have only two of them or one

00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:08,250
yeah you can obviously not really put it

00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,990
on your booth and say like well you know

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,670
someone is interesting they can grab it

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,690
because that kind of means you'll run

00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:18,240
out of pecos after one or two if you're

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,480
lucky so then you need to do something

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,520
else you can do a lottery or you can do

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,330
combine it with another tip which is the

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,510
second tip the one on the right

00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:33,180
organised talks at your booth just not

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,680
not no big right not competing with the

00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,480
talks that are at the conference for

00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,520
example where you are but short simple

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:45,660
overviews of simple things related to

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,700
opensuse I mean the subject here are you

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:50,370
know doing on clouds setting up uncloudy

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:53,570
on opensuse a couple of years ago but i

00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:57,390
was already cloudy core management

00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:01,560
up-armored i mean these things are you

00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:03,660
know well they attract 56 people but

00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,640
they give you quite a good chance to

00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,970
really talk to these five or six people

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:12,210
and well these quality and traxxas are

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:15,780
very useful obviously I've also given

00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,820
overviews of KDE I'll transkei de tips

00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,490
I'm a KDE guy so I can do that but if

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:24,240
you're a nun user on xfc user give

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:28,020
advance xfce tips you know beforehand

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:31,830
you look it up you put 10 20 tips in a

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,660
series of quick slides and in 15-20

00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:36,570
minutes you go over it and do another 10

00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,020
minutes of Q&A now you get five six

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:38,580
seven

00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,290
people to the booth I mean everybody's

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:43,830
interested usually in this kind of stuff

00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:46,560
or a lot of people are and again good

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:48,080
interactions but also usually the

00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,640
conference's really like this stuff

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,710
because it gives more life to the booth

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,820
area and that's obviously good thing for

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:58,560
them too and if you're smart you ask

00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,870
them if you can hang out posters with

00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,460
the schedule everywhere and then you

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:06,150
know you spread the gig or branding a

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,430
little bit cool thing is our branding

00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:14,310
packet or other booths packages that you

00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:17,310
get should have a special poster a tree

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,890
I think in them with room for a schedule

00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:22,950
just like that because i wanted to

00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:24,990
enable people you know doing booths with

00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:29,820
opensuse to be able to do exactly this

00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:31,560
give little talks at the booth so that

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,510
promotion of the booth can really make

00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:35,850
quite a big difference basically you get

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,890
you know yeah brand the place a little

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,920
bit right make it green and get people

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:43,230
to your booth yeah it has opensuse booth

00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,480
how I know the font is horrible i

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,100
initially picked something else but if

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,410
you have these hanging up everywhere

00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,180
people will know your booth and they

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,550
will see oh there's Katie talk and you

00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:55,500
up suitable that four o'clock people

00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:58,770
will show up this really works very well

00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,270
and last thing well you know be cool

00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:10,310
work with others connect to other

00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:13,800
projects nothing wrong with that okay

00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:19,170
one more tip there's already lots of the

00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:22,170
list have something no obvious crawling

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:26,490
on a screen at your booth at some point

00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:28,440
we basically let open QA run and I'll QA

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,200
testing linux distros i mean you go

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,180
there you see something running and then

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,460
though there are checklists and cause

00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,610
things going red and green because you

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,840
know tests were failing and succeeding

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:41,340
people start to ask questions because

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,380
they see something and they don't get it

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,030
which is actually good right you can

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,460
even just make a video of it and play

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,400
that and then people ask you well

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,740
there's this well that's open QA testing

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,140
open

00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,580
Sousa oh well then you have a good thing

00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,830
to talk about because what makes

00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,720
opensuse special or one of the things

00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:02,559
that makes opensuse special is the tools

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,110
we have which is OBS and oak QA and

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,179
results of that which is opensuse being

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,820
a very stable distribution compared to

00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:11,440
most other you know then existence right

00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,020
we have a longer release article 8

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,480
months even 12 months now that gives us

00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:18,580
more time to stabilize stuff but we also

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,040
do a lot more testing than for example

00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,960
Fedora does and we don't break

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,800
everything with every update like they

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,110
often tend to do this is called fishing

00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,790
by the way you're fishing for people who

00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:32,320
find nerdy things on the screen

00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:36,520
interesting because those are usually

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,710
direct people to talk to so again you

00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,870
can get open to a videos actually from

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,570
the open qho don't use the dark side and

00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:49,330
they very make very good you know fish

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:51,220
food is there still time and I think

00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:55,240
actually I talk really quick so yes

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:57,510
there is then you can ask questions or

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:07,230
share your own tips and ideas and

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:14,070
whatever you have if any anybody nobody

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:17,280
I'll try one more time anybody okay salt

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,280
