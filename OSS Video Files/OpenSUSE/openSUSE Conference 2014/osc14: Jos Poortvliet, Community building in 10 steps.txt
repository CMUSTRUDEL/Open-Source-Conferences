Title: osc14: Jos Poortvliet, Community building in 10 steps
Publication date: 2014-04-28
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Building a community is a lot of work and there is much you have to keep in mind. This talk will present 10 steps to building your own community.

Building a community has two sides: a practical and a organizational. Practically, you have to get something people can rally around. Code you work on is an obvious first but you want to build a local meet-up, you look for subjects for talks, articles, things to do like a installfest or theme evenings.

When building up a community, governance is another thing to think about. Should there be rules? What rules? Who should be in charge, or should nobody be in charge? The answers to these questions have far reaching consequences on the future of a project.

	00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:06,200
so this is my sixth and last talk here

00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:13,080
well I'm gonna do the about me because

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,820
well this is being recorded so please

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,590
for that otherwise I think you all know

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,199
me and have seen me more than you

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,270
probably won't do but my name is your

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,699
sport fleets I live in Berlin with my

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:26,580
wife Camilla who was here but left

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:30,359
earlier today and popcorn are awesome

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:32,759
dog I work for own cloud as community

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,239
manager but I used to be a community

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,160
manager for opensuse at Susan and this

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,040
presentation is about building a local

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,989
community it's very much about local

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,480
meetups and things like that so with

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,660
local community and really am mostly

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:52,020
talking about in the city or an area in

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,910
general it's very much based on a lot of

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,199
feedback and input i got from people

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,760
basically well everywhere but more input

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,829
is absolutely welcome I would really

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,350
love it if you know you people have

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,479
something to add to this a lot of people

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,220
have of course valuable experience with

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,650
this and yeah it's all it's great to

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:15,299
make this better and more useful so

00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:17,880
doing a community building effort

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,280
locally has a really big advantage over

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,049
building a global community which is you

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,840
can actually meet in person face-to-face

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,549
and that is I think by far the coolest

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,110
thing ever I mean hey we're here at the

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:29,670
alps user conference and one of the

00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,130
things that school is you can actually

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,920
see each other and you know do group

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,810
hugs and group photos and group parties

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,560
and dinners and all these nice things

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,490
face to face which is a lot more fun and

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,799
also very effective thing right i mean

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,439
face-to-face communication is a lot more

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,590
effective than IRC at least for a lot of

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,479
issues it's even the only way but of

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,430
course if you want to organize local

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,649
meetings you need to have some kind of

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,490
idea what to do at these meetings how to

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,439
organize these meetings etc etc so if

00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:06,570
you want to do that if you're interested

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,090
in building local community by the

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,190
opensuse or own cloud or anything else I

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,730
hope that this talk will be helpful for

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,470
you

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:18,120
and opensuse specific as the solution of

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,950
course we have a nice advantage when it

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,959
comes to local meetings and one of the

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,629
things you need to do is to get content

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,420
well as this ruching new ship pretty

00:02:24,629 --> 00:02:29,519
much anything you know there's mysql so

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,620
you can get somebody to talk about mysql

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,650
there's no meu can get someone to talk

00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,930
about now there is you know linux kernel

00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,440
python ruby there's lots of different

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,879
things you can talk about and discuss at

00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,190
the same time of course it also has a

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:46,590
bit of a downside the people who come to

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,120
a gnome talk will most certainly not be

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,459
the same people who come to a pipe at

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,769
all so it's a bit harder to build up

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:55,260
community so you should definitely do

00:02:52,769 --> 00:03:03,290
regular things that are well opensuse

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:05,970
specific in any case let's talk about

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:07,799
focus because that's of course what I'm

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,670
talking about you need to make some

00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,829
choices there so your project really

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,079
should be on the agenda at least died

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:18,239
and I have the other meeting or maybe at

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,660
the beginning of a meeting you first

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,560
spent 5 10 15 minutes going over the

00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:28,489
latest you know news and gossip from the

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,769
opensuse project or the implant or again

00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:34,980
door sign project what that you want to

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,260
talk about on the other hand it is good

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,849
to be open to have people even from

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,260
other distributions there sometimes to

00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:42,480
give it to have people from other

00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:45,480
projects involved I mean this this

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,250
brings and not just you know new ideas

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,380
new excitement for your own local team

00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,900
but also by having people from other

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,910
community that simply attracts people

00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,220
outside of your own group right and if

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,489
you want to have a nice successful local

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:04,109
fun meeting its well more people the

00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:06,419
merrier as they say another aspect of

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,760
focus is that it's good to have a clear

00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,709
goal to really have an idea of what your

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,359
local meetup is about especially if

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,680
there are other meetups that might not

00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:16,139
be relevant if you live in a small

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,019
village but it is if you live in a big

00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,400
city like Berlin New York Boston you

00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,650
know a cities like that there are a lot

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,840
of media meetups there might be a Python

00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,509
quilty meet up every month there might

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,550
be a ruby on rails girls meet up thing

00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:35,949
every month now you can't thought to

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,199
compete with them to some extent you do

00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:40,090
or at least to add to them you need to

00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,120
have something that's different about

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:46,810
your meeting obviously so you need to

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,139
have a kind of you know the short

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:52,120
mission statement maybe you know like in

00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:54,370
this these meetings we share knowledge

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,330
of and promote project x + weekly

00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:01,449
meetings or bi-weekly or monthly so you

00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,300
have a real idea of what it is about and

00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:08,770
more specific is better obviously I mean

00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:11,100
this is very generic second part when

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:15,250
you want to set up local meetings is

00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:17,199
well to get started with that and you

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,539
know in the beginning that's gonna be

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,910
small and really that's okay if you have

00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:23,650
five to seven people show up half of its

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,530
our co-workers and the other half family

00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:32,320
well fine gotta start somewhere and this

00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:34,630
is okay so yeah start with that I'd find

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,150
find a venue I mean if you can do that

00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,039
an office at work or at a little room

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,620
and university that's usually good place

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,240
you should try not to spend money on it

00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,449
because honestly if you start you can

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,789
always keep spending it and it's easiest

00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,830
as you can get a public place and even

00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,440
public libraries I mean there are often

00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:56,800
a local community centers that are happy

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,590
to host a meeting about a subject even

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,849
as they don't understand it and so

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:05,470
that's really cool in terms of time it

00:06:03,849 --> 00:06:07,270
depends a bit on where you live in some

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:09,550
places you shouldn't do a meeting like

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,110
this you know after eight and other

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:14,050
places you really should do it before

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,699
eight so this might be something you can

00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,250
look at what our communities do without

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,979
you if there are like again the local

00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,780
python SS might have a monthly meeting

00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:25,419
or something like that to check it check

00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,310
out see what they do if it worked for

00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:29,090
them at eight o clock it's likely that

00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:31,639
it'll work for you too as long as

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,880
dude on the same day you know then

00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,320
you're really competing for attention

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,050
but experiment would they try to me you

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,960
could also just start at six and if you

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:44,419
notice everybody says well I could just

00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:48,110
make it can you do it later then do so

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:50,449
I'm just be flexible with that it's nice

00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:53,330
to have like a little bit of you know

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:55,370
coffee tea and maybe even cake but it's

00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,340
all the huge deal and I wouldn't go for

00:06:55,370 --> 00:07:01,340
full catering for sure if only for the

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,139
money but obviously you know if it's fun

00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,910
and people are interested you can say

00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:06,860
hey how about you order pizza and you

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:11,960
just let everybody put in something and

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:14,180
you know order pizza that's cool if you

00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,580
want to do a little more like with then

00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,229
coffee and tea then you might need a

00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,979
little sponsoring but I'll get to that

00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:25,190
later now of course a big deal is

00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:28,610
getting people there right I mean that's

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:32,150
why you do it so the thing you need to

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,780
know about people is that what attracts

00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:37,430
them is a content that's why of course I

00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,380
already said you need to focus indeed

00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,090
have something interesting why you need

00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,500
to maybe have interesting speakers or

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,570
something like that and it doesn't have

00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,580
to be big in the beginning you can talk

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:49,280
yourself or get you know colleagues to

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,260
talk about stuff but it's contact

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,479
content that's going to attract people

00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,620
in the beginning people come for things

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:59,780
that interest them talking about privacy

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:04,910
in this NSA time is always interesting

00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:07,789
so that will attract people and I would

00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,010
really also let this come from yourself

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,020
and the things that interest you should

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:13,970
really be high on the agenda if only to

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,599
motivate you to organize these meetings

00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:19,340
so pick interesting people around you

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,099
either colleagues or people you know

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,280
from a little further away and let them

00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:28,400
give talks have discussions something

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,900
like that about things that's a good

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,760
start so in general you know you may

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,280
need to make sure that what you're doing

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,200
there is interesting yeah now there are

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:41,419
many parts to doing something

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,990
interesting but one of them is obviously

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,720
to have

00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,670
kind of decent quality speaker there's a

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,380
lot more to speak than his or her

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:51,830
personality and just doing something

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,570
interesting is really important for a

00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:56,180
speaker if they do something interesting

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:58,700
that really carries ninety percent of

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,700
the message but it obviously also helps

00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,959
if they have a little bit experienced

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,060
presenting and if they have decent

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,370
slides now obviously you come change

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,110
these things all that easy but certainly

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,610
the slide thing you can help with there

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,190
are lots of tips on the internet and

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,770
even in my videos or my other talks

00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,130
about how to make these presentation and

00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:21,500
it's really worth trying to get a

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,660
contact with potential speaker before if

00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,450
they don't live in the same city dude

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,510
over hang out if they live close by look

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,110
them up maybe invite them for food in a

00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:34,820
pub or something and go over the slides

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,709
seriously just just make sure that you

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,170
really kind of know already what scum

00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,459
and you can give some feedback okay this

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,110
will make them feel a little more

00:09:40,459 --> 00:09:43,940
certain about what they're gonna do

00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,220
because then it fits with what you want

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,270
and you have a much better idea about

00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:55,550
them now so really think about that you

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:57,709
know get gets people and talk to them it

00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,899
also helps to find out of course the

00:09:57,709 --> 00:10:02,079
right person I already said it helps if

00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,399
they know what they're talking about and

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,440
especially if you want to do you know

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,870
really technical meetings try to get a

00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,910
technical person not a journalist or a

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:15,230
blogger you know try to get a developer

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:17,029
obviously they might be less good at

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,910
speaking but they do know what they're

00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:22,459
talking about and that is a big plus so

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,450
getting people really from the project

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:29,360
that you want to discuss is a big help

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:32,089
as opposed to getting someone who merely

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,860
writes about the subject but it's all

00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:35,660
the black of my thing I mean it helps if

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,089
you have a local tech writer or a local

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:40,010
tech journalist of course they can know

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:42,560
a lot about subjects and they usually

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,000
are better at presenting it so you know

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,959
there's there's a bit of a balance there

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,959
that you need to find

00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:52,619
and keep good relationship for speakers

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,369
because you might want to invite them

00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:58,679
again so you know keep in contact rights

00:10:56,369 --> 00:11:00,600
and given feedback afterwards a lot of

00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:03,569
speakers really appreciate it if you can

00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,869
tell them the same day or later how they

00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:08,519
did and what the people thought about it

00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:10,850
I mean that that gives them feedback

00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:15,019
they can use to improve their you know

00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:19,799
presentation or their subject as well

00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:21,629
now after you have picked the good

00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:23,489
subject and something found something

00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,619
good to talk about a find a good speaker

00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:30,059
about that subject and help him or her

00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:31,799
get good slides together etc etc yep the

00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:34,589
place itself you need to make sure of

00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,319
course that people feel welcome there

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:40,919
are a lot of ways to do that but i have

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:44,459
a few tips there especially in small

00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:48,389
groups it might be nice to present new

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:50,579
visitors shortly to the group but please

00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:52,230
check if they're like that because

00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,759
obviously not all people are very

00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,649
comfortable standing in front of a group

00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,709
of people and either being talked about

00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,809
or talking themselves so you should

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:02,549
absolutely make sure that if there's a

00:12:00,809 --> 00:12:05,189
new person you go to the media talk to

00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:07,559
them just introduce yourself say hi you

00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:10,139
know I'm this and this I organized this

00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,899
meeting would you be okay to present

00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,299
yourself not mandatory just an idea but

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,999
if you want you know most of us know

00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,769
each other so you know then you can join

00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:21,839
the gang if they don't want to that's

00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:25,799
cool that's fine just you know let them

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,289
look I mean that's cool once your group

00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:30,809
is growing it's actually good idea to

00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:34,049
try and find a volunteer to basically

00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:36,209
welcome people make sure that you know

00:12:34,049 --> 00:12:39,720
everyone at the meeting is being talked

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:41,970
to obviously not everybody likes to be

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,309
you know with the role of welcoming

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,410
people but having someone who feels it

00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:48,329
as his or her responsibility that

00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:50,789
everybody feels welcome and is being

00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:52,619
welcomed and is you know in context of

00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:54,660
other people is really good and its

00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:57,239
really simple thing right it's not hard

00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,940
and you know again depending on where

00:12:57,239 --> 00:13:01,280
you live you know

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,260
and you shouldn't do this in Germany but

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,600
it can actually it works in Asia and

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,480
South America pretty well call them I

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,010
don't know director of communications

00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,680
you know make it really like that's

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,750
their role give it a title and make it

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,550
official that's the person who takes

00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,560
care of this it's much more important

00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,570
role than you might think okay they can

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,490
put it on the LinkedIn even and who

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,350
gives them a reason to work for it and

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:26,480
then if they don't do it then you can

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:32,600
say hey you were supposed to do this

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:35,060
right another nice tip here make sure

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,820
that by the entry or exit what it wasn't

00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,380
the same thing completely is a piece of

00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,390
paper of people can leave like your

00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,160
email address so you can add them to

00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:47,120
Magnus or something and you can contact

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:49,910
them the visitors I'm talking about so

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,560
this way you build up you know a contact

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,390
list of people that you can tell about

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,450
new meetings that you will have about

00:13:53,390 --> 00:14:00,190
new events or even ask for input and is

00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:04,400
for speakers etc I have put put an email

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:06,440
subscription list at the entry so once

00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:09,280
you have something going assuming that

00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:12,470
all these tips helped you in some way

00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:14,120
it's time to start trying to grow now

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,890
you have regular meetings there are a

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,450
couple of people come in there it is fun

00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:19,670
you start to get to know each other you

00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:23,990
you know go out for drinks every now and

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:26,200
then how do you get further first step

00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:31,040
is of course getting the word out

00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,930
advertising a little bit it's nice to

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,940
have a website with info about the

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:37,040
meetings keeping it really simple as

00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:41,270
just fine you can also do it at a site

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:44,390
like meetup com but in general I would

00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:46,610
use a bunch of social media or so I

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,410
would make sure that there's one place

00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:51,560
where people can find the authoritative

00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:54,230
information and then you set up a

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,510
Facebook event page and maybe even

00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,060
Twitter thingy Google+ event page of

00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:02,030
course and link it all to this you know

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,700
one page don't make it too big I mean

00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,870
you need to be able to maintain it

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,860
obviously if you have a voluntary loss

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,810
building websites which in our

00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,720
t world is of course not unlikely then

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:15,209
cool use it let him or her do that you

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,079
know then you have a director of I don't

00:15:15,209 --> 00:15:22,079
know website but otherwise just keep it

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,430
simple and try to automate things a

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,829
little bit you know you can spend

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,690
massive amounts of time on Twitter and

00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:29,910
Facebook and Google+ but you can also

00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:31,620
connect them and just use one of them

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:35,339
right that's what I personally do as

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:37,950
well it's not perfect but it works it is

00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:39,990
nice to have a mailing list or a forum

00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:41,760
depending on your audience our people

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,550
can they even talk about things and keep

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,990
at the community alive in the time that

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,600
you don't have meetings because

00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,519
obviously the online part is for a lot

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,890
of us really important as well most of

00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,910
us feel completely lost without laptop

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:58,350
step log tablets and internet and so

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:01,860
having a place where you can have

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,870
discussions is really good especially if

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:06,209
you try and do reports of all the

00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:08,070
meetings I mean can be short but

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:11,820
something with you know a couple of

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:14,550
pictures and a short report on what the

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:16,230
speaker talked about etc if you manage

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:18,779
to put that on your site a simple

00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:20,519
wordpress install maybe that gives

00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:22,470
people also an idea of the previous

00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,279
meetings what it is about what kind of

00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:27,810
subject you have and I mean just a

00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:29,760
meet-up you have no idea where it's

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,060
coming from it's quite a different thing

00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:34,829
than going to a meetup where you know

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:37,980
that has been going on for a year and

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:41,130
we're regularly people go to so build up

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:43,320
this history and maintain that is you

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,449
know easy and it's again something you

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,850
can delegate to someone because when you

00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:51,870
grow you we need to delegate things that

00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:55,079
becomes more and more important another

00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:57,779
way to promote your events your local

00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:01,860
community is to go to local you know

00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:05,549
linux user groups local other events

00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,589
maybe and hang up you know an a4 with

00:17:05,549 --> 00:17:09,270
some info about your meetups your

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:11,579
community so many people who go to one

00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:13,920
events are often the type of people who

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,740
surprise go to events so they might come

00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,930
yours too no reason not to promote a

00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:25,110
little bit in your local community that

00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:27,360
way once you start to grow you might

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:29,750
need a bigger venue you might even need

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,370
some money for coffee tea and cake and

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,010
if you're interested in trying to find

00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,560
sponsors try to find more than one if

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,200
you go phones us get multiple sponsors

00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:43,680
it's better to ask one sponsor once a

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:46,490
year then to I so that ad that you have

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,930
12 for example better to have self

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,520
multiple sponsors that you eat ask once

00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:53,030
a year then to have to go back to one

00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:56,310
sponsor again and again and again and

00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:58,800
another thing is don't be too shy and

00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:03,480
ask for too little money basically for

00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:06,150
most companies it is about as much work

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:12,300
and effort and honestly pretty much cost

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:16,140
dube to pay 150 bucks or 500 so ask for

00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:19,200
500 and then you've done it's easier to

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,270
ask 5 sponsors eats once a year for

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,490
money and they use that for one or two

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:27,930
meetings then to try for each meeting

00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:29,670
that tree sponsors it's it's just a lot

00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:33,630
harder for companies to pay smaller

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:37,200
amounts again for especially for bigger

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:40,260
companies a thousand or 250 it's the

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,810
same really they don't care about that

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,050
it's just extra work for them to do 250

00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:49,920
4 times so they want yeah find local

00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:52,830
sponsors local IT companies maybe there

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:54,570
might be interested simply because the

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:56,820
audience that you get at your meetings

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,170
might be interesting for them right or

00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,650
they might be working on the reputation

00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:03,600
in the local tech community you'd be

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,420
surprised how often small local

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,540
companies are quite ok paying a couple

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,600
of hundred euros once a year to have

00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:14,130
their name you know at these local tech

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,200
meetings especially again if its

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:20,370
technical this is really valuable for

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:21,750
them I know complicate it gets

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,940
complicated when you have to handle

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:27,000
money so just let them pay the bill for

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,610
something I'd just get your catering to

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,740
make a bill and let them pay that

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:33,960
directly it's much easier than having to

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,650
handle cash and it's often possible to

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,350
do it that way in the US you can often

00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:42,120
use american express gift checks that

00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:44,790
actually makes handling the money a lot

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:52,380
easier not an option in europe but in

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:54,150
the US this really works when you're

00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,190
looking for sponsors ask the people who

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,560
come to your meetups if they know a

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,110
company maybe their employers interested

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,000
they can very often help you find a

00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,000
local company who's willing to help

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,890
spoons or something small and obviously

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,330
you should be worth the sponsors as well

00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:14,190
right I mean put the logo on the webpage

00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,750
mentioned them you know try and make

00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:17,730
sure that you measure the hits to your

00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,980
website so that the sponsor actually

00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:21,690
knows what they're paying for if you get

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,120
five or you get five hundred visitors

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,650
makes a big difference for a sponsor

00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,430
when they want to put the banner on your

00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:31,140
website so i keep a contact with your

00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:33,090
sponsors even if there's bones are like

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,760
once a year you go to the once a year

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:38,430
make sure you have like a newsletter for

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,740
your you know local meetups and you sent

00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,420
on the reports every month you know a

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,150
make sure that they're mentioned in the

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,980
report you know thanks to our sponsors

00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:48,240
and that way they get a feeling that

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:50,070
they're actually getting something for

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,630
their money after all their companies

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,960
they need to make money it needs to be

00:20:51,630 --> 00:21:01,170
worth it for them now be a little smart

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:03,990
about that if you can more growth tips

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,760
and this is really simple trick if you

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,890
want to try and grow your community and

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,370
do something like a bring a friend

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:14,910
program with small rewards you know so

00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:16,530
that is ask everybody who comes to bring

00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,450
someone they know and might be

00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,240
interested in the subject for next week

00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:23,040
next month etc and then suddenly well

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,110
you have to twice as many people and

00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,700
some of them might stick around and you

00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,860
know how if you do that twice a year and

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,690
everybody who succeeds at bringing a

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,410
friend get something you know ask one of

00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:35,910
your sponsors for a pack of USB sticks

00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:38,070
it's simple these kind of things but

00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,430
they really work you get more people

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,430
this way

00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:49,379
one tip this is something you know that

00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:51,720
came up at quite a few events you notice

00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:56,580
in communities people love to do crazy

00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,799
things and sometimes the people you know

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,450
either in charge or companies around

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,700
these communities they don't really like

00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,379
that because it's weird you know or

00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,629
something crazy is happening with their

00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:08,460
brand you know like some of the ESPYs I

00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:12,090
don't know making a graffiti of their

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,429
ego you know really this is cool

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,289
supported love it make pictures of it

00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:18,899
promote the heck out of it this kind of

00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:21,779
creativity and enthusiasm it's the sign

00:22:18,899 --> 00:22:24,809
of an you know effective fun local

00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:27,690
community so if you come up with a logo

00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:29,369
please be really relaxed about it and

00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:31,980
let everybody to to it on the forehead

00:22:29,369 --> 00:22:34,320
or whatever they want okay getting it

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,090
out is good creativity is good it's

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,460
team-building it's giving people a

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,259
chance to do something funny I mean we

00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,960
have folded to self because you have

00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:45,090
cube because we have all this stuff is

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,989
awesome okay promote it let people do

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:51,239
this now when you're growing you might

00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:53,039
get a little bigger I mean this is

00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:55,889
obviously only interesting when you have

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,989
like 50 people there every month you

00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:59,249
know you can't be there every month so

00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:01,080
you need to make sure that when you're

00:22:59,249 --> 00:23:03,330
not there it's still running so you need

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,580
to find some minions some people willing

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:08,399
to do the work I use the term minions

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:10,980
because in open source there are always

00:23:08,399 --> 00:23:13,200
more minions and leaders there are few

00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,970
people willing to start initiatives and

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,470
put in the work to actually make them

00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,539
happen they're also playing always

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,269
plenty of people willing to talk we are

00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,950
not talking about talking I'm talking

00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:24,899
about people are willing to start

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,720
something up and just get doing it

00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:29,369
instead of talking there are always a

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,940
lot more people are willing to actually

00:23:29,369 --> 00:23:35,700
help such a person you're willing to do

00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:38,460
put in some effort to support it and

00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,129
make it happen now you need to find

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,129
those people and help them you know tell

00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:45,899
them what to do and make them help you

00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:47,789
with the event given responsibilities

00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:49,349
like I already gave a couple of example

00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:51,749
somebody who welcomes people somebody

00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:52,110
who takes care of the website somebody

00:23:51,749 --> 00:23:54,120
who

00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:57,240
maybe talk to the spawns or somebody who

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:58,710
writes reports etc these things are you

00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,830
know these are things you can quite

00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:04,530
easily hand over to other people

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,420
obviously when you do it you really need

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,130
to hand it over right you need to step

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,850
back and trust them that they do a

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:13,410
decent job so it's okay if they ask like

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,920
how should I do this and then you say

00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:18,900
well for example you can do XYZ but if

00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,000
they want to do something else well you

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,280
should give responsibilities not tasks

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,740
try to give people a responsibility for

00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,000
something and if they want to do it in a

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:30,860
different way then you would have done

00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:33,330
it you need to give them some freedom

00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:35,669
perfectionism and micromanagement are

00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:37,590
really things that don't work in the

00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:39,720
long run so don't micromanage give

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,660
something to someone else and let them

00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,880
run with it that's gonna mean that that

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,320
means they're gonna make mistakes but

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,240
that's part of learning okay people

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,820
can't learn without making mistakes if

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,520
you want other people to ever take over

00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,380
a task from you you gotta accept that

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,450
they will make mistakes that it's going

00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,549
to get screwed up once or twice you

00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,809
gotta live with that otherwise well if

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:03,450
you really want to do it all year round

00:25:00,809 --> 00:25:05,640
that's fine but realize that it's going

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:08,100
to die the moment you stop and that it

00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,950
will never get big because it can't get

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,110
big if one person does the work so if

00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:15,120
you really care about it going to have

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:19,140
to accept that other people need to

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,150
learn and make mistakes now of course

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,160
that doesn't mean you can't keep an eye

00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,510
on them because people well they don't

00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,400
just make mistakes but they also

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:28,679
disappear sometimes or just don't do

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,870
what they're supposed to do that's not a

00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,480
thing I mean you can keep an eye on it

00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,850
give feedback to people and ask them are

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,730
you really still doing this now

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,350
obviously if someone can't do there you

00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:43,290
know job the thing they're supposed to

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:45,059
do once or twice that's okay but if they

00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:46,410
consistently field and at some point

00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,440
yeah you're going to have to find

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:51,929
someone else to do it and hand it over

00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,760
that's not cool so you should really

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,730
give people a chance to admit for

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,580
themselves they can't do it and to step

00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,340
down but yeah there is a point where you

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,320
have to do with yourself and that

00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:06,440
that sometimes not cool but don't do it

00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,360
because they make mistakes because then

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,670
they're still learning okay do it if

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:13,070
they really don't want to learn what I

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:14,630
can't put in the time don't punish

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,610
people for making mistakes because

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:18,860
that's just one of the biggest I think

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,210
problems in our society in general which

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,130
I'm not trying to fix you I'm just

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,410
telling you don't punish people for

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:28,850
mistakes and punish them for not

00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:31,610
learning from them that's fair another

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:33,260
thing is value all contributions okay it

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,420
doesn't matter how small someone brought

00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,610
cake to a meeting you know make sure

00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,380
that you announce it I say that person

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,120
is awesome because they made cake let's

00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:44,960
all eat it and that's of course assuming

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,810
the cake is nice too but be happy in

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,210
general I mean even if people just tweet

00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:51,860
it and retweeted the meeting thank them

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,020
for it they're helping you promote it

00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,520
it's valuable right you reaching people

00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,670
outside of your group thank people for

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,290
what I do always give credit to other

00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,110
people don't always try to be in the

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:05,240
spotlight yourself now if someone else

00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,220
helps you with something give them some

00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,710
attention for that I mean that's cool

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,810
credit where it is due and even a little

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:15,560
more credit than might totally be do is

00:27:11,810 --> 00:27:23,000
cool okay it's important for community

00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:24,800
building so gather most communities have

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,620
a small number of very active people

00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:30,320
that do stuff right it's always a lot of

00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,970
people join a lot of people talk much

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,960
more a number of people actually does

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:38,240
stuff so these people deserve some extra

00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:39,980
attention these are the people you go

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,140
out with once a month for dinner

00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,480
together just with that group that

00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,970
actually does the work little bit of

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,910
exclusivity really isn't that bad it's

00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,640
okay I mean the opposite of conference

00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:54,500
only is also you know we give travel

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,020
support only for the people that won't

00:27:54,500 --> 00:28:00,170
do stuff right at least that's that's

00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:02,090
the idea behind things like this and

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,190
these are also people you can get

00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,840
feedback from so at this dinner you can

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:10,460
discuss what you can approve get ideas

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,710
you know discuss what to do next

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,749
obviously have who can do what

00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,759
share of them what's going on I mean

00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:21,070
after all they might now be minions but

00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:23,080
in the future they might be able to take

00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,960
over things from you bigger things and

00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,429
even if you well I don't know move to

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,590
another city and can't continue the

00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:30,970
meeting anymore it's really nice if

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:33,460
there's a successor who can actually

00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:35,889
take over so share with the Moscow and

00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,499
on share wap why you do things what the

00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:40,269
problems are first of all because they

00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:42,879
might help out a second of all that's

00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:50,080
how they learn what the work is or what

00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:55,779
needs to be done I already mentioned the

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,639
other things here okay yeah and by the

00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:59,950
way someone who steps down because they

00:28:57,639 --> 00:29:01,809
can't do something anymore you know

00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,029
that's not an embarrassing thing right

00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:06,639
we all have a real life it's okay to not

00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:08,109
be able to do something it happens to me

00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:09,700
a hundred times that someone in the

00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:12,159
community promised to do something and

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,009
they're manats they couldn't manage to

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,320
do it that's okay okay we have real

00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:19,659
lives and our family you know shoot

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,700
really matter more than you know whether

00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:24,070
you updated a website online I mean

00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:26,379
we'll survive without that website and

00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:28,779
you know if your boyfriend or girlfriend

00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:32,349
leaves you that really is a much bigger

00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:34,090
deal so you know be realistic about that

00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:35,739
okay people will not have time for

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,960
everything and make clear that that's

00:29:35,739 --> 00:29:40,509
okay if they want to spend more time on

00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,960
the family or if they wanna do something

00:29:40,509 --> 00:29:46,539
else cool I make make sure that they

00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,429
don't feel locked into whatever you know

00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,109
they're supposed to be doing doesn't

00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:51,789
mean you don't need to be reliable if

00:29:50,109 --> 00:29:54,009
you can't do something in time you

00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:56,139
should tell people that's different

00:29:54,009 --> 00:30:00,989
thing but it's not an embarrassing thing

00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:03,580
it's just you know it's normal it's okay

00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:04,989
it's good as a local community to also

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:06,549
stay connected to the international

00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:09,190
community so in case of for opensuse

00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:11,259
make sure that well if you can't at

00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:13,659
least someone on the team you know

00:30:11,259 --> 00:30:15,639
follows the international news and can

00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:17,139
actually tell you guys what's going on

00:30:15,639 --> 00:30:18,849
if something is happening

00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:21,820
internationally like the opposite of

00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:23,470
conference it's really cool to the week

00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,830
or the month after the conference do a

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,140
meeting about the conference

00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,149
to you know discuss what happened maybe

00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:33,720
have someone you know who went to the

00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:35,909
car for speak about the event maybe play

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:41,130
one or two of the talks may be the

00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:42,659
keynote every meeting you can have a 15

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,549
20 minute session as we already

00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:46,919
mentioned to discuss the international

00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:49,289
news the gossip you know who is angry at

00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,960
who I mean you know that is the stuff

00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:55,799
that keeps people you know excited and

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,510
engaged so stay connected you know and

00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,889
maybe every now and then you can invite

00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:04,950
people from the international community

00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:06,539
to come visit and to give a talk you

00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:09,840
know maybe if you can find a local

00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,909
sponsor to help with the travel support

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,340
for someone from the international

00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:16,110
community or we have trouble support

00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,450
program which is for this if you have

00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,340
local community you would like to have

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,340
somebody really cool come and give a

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:25,350
talk well email the 12 support program

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,559
hey you know I'd like to have person X

00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:30,779
wires that come and visit my program my

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,179
local community to give a talk can you

00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,340
help support that most communities have

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,240
support for this so use it for that

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:40,950
there there's money for that okay

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,549
another thing is of course stay in

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:47,370
contact with the upstream community so

00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:49,320
to say actively from local to there so

00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:52,049
send reports maybe every now and then

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,970
use the materials that they use open

00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:56,130
suse has a lot of materials actually for

00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:58,980
people for local events we have ready

00:31:56,130 --> 00:32:01,019
made presentations occasionally about

00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,639
new releases or about technologies we

00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:04,830
have that you can use for your local

00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:07,559
community so use the materials that are

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,389
available ask maybe for either now a

00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,419
package here some stickers and flyers

00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:14,370
and stuff every now and then and use

00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:20,700
what you have basically in what we have

00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:24,480
locally it slightly less positive thing

00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,630
perhaps it's important to keep a healthy

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,330
atmosphere in the community and

00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:33,330
unfortunately this doesn't always go by

00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,980
itself as I already said you know it's

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:37,289
good to write down what your community

00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,940
is about and what it's doing well while

00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:41,460
your edits

00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:43,680
a code of conduct is probably good idea

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,840
the earlier you have this the easier it

00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:49,530
is because introducing a code of conduct

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,280
and a community of 500 people can be

00:32:49,530 --> 00:32:54,930
tough as I have experienced it's a lot

00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,450
easier to have it at the beginning and

00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,400
obviously there's this is all obvious

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,010
stuff you know an anti-harassment thing

00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,690
you know people should behave not the be

00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:06,780
rules with other people I mean this is

00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:09,840
obvious but there are people who feel

00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:13,170
they can do or say anything and then it

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,540
can be necessary to deal with that I

00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:17,460
have some tips about how to do a code of

00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,380
conduct but honestly I would suggest to

00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,840
look online look at the code of conduct

00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,690
of a big community like opensuse and

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:26,160
start from there copy dad's just use

00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:28,920
that for beta more with a few

00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,050
modifications instead of making your own

00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,840
because there is a bunch of mistakes you

00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,430
can make while making a code of conduct

00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,010
including trying to make a list of all

00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,710
the things you can do wrong that list is

00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:42,900
first of all endless a second of all

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,440
very much up for debate which means you

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:50,250
can discuss it forever so you know copy

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:53,850
one online other thing is if people

00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:55,890
behave badly I gave some feedback tips

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:59,430
in my talk about social skills for geeks

00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:02,370
use those talk to people in private

00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:05,430
given the warning may be given the time

00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:07,890
out tell them look this really didn't

00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:10,380
work you're not welcome next week or

00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:12,990
next meeting and then let them come back

00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,810
after that I mean people again make

00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:17,430
mistakes so given time to learn but at

00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:21,060
the same time there are people who never

00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:23,870
learn unfortunately so be prepared to

00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,840
tell them they're never ever welcome

00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:30,150
that really can happen sometimes I mean

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,760
a single person can really kill an

00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:36,480
entire community if you let them so

00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,980
don't okay and if you get stuff like I

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,750
don't know a freedom of speech and that

00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,210
kind of nonsense it's totally irrelevant

00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,680
here x Cassidy has a beautiful comic

00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:47,280
about this I should have included it

00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,690
here but freedom of speech means that

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,790
you can say whatever you want without

00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,000
the government locking you up and you

00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:54,399
could say it

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,649
outside in your own garden or your own

00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,690
your own website freedom of speech does

00:34:56,649 --> 00:35:01,690
not mean you're allowed to ruin other

00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:04,750
people's lives okay and if people don't

00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:06,730
like you and close the door and don't

00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,280
want you have their meetings that's not

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:11,260
limiting freedom of your speech it just

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,210
means your dick and they don't like you

00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:18,100
yeah so you are doing a meeting with a

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,220
couple of other people you're having fun

00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,920
that's your place if people don't behave

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,350
there that's their problem and you have

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,990
every right to deny them access to your

00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:31,300
meeting okay so don't feel bad about

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:34,930
that again don't don't use this lightly

00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:38,710
you certainly shouldn't but don't let

00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:41,320
some one person ruin it don't drag it

00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:43,060
out don't let one person come back again

00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,470
and again and again and ruin the

00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:47,050
atmosphere kick them off the mailing

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:50,740
list kick them off the forum click them

00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:53,200
out if it's necessary I know it's

00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:56,470
negative but seriously this happens and

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,220
it's not fun I know some people are

00:35:56,470 --> 00:36:01,780
diagrammed so i made a diagram that

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:06,370
would be you know how to get started

00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:08,380
with community some resources there's

00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:10,810
there's a lot of resources on the web on

00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,780
how to do local events tips and other

00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:15,100
stuff I'll put my slides online as well

00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,480
most of the things i have set is

00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,670
actually in the note section of my

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,380
slides so if you think you know what is

00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:22,840
the use of all these you know funny

00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:24,670
colorful pictures well there is more

00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:30,190
information in my slides then you know

00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:33,310
you might think so that's it for now any

00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:37,590
questions feedback ideas what should i

00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:37,590
ask to the presentation tell me

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,860
okay supposing I don't have any idea

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,170
what my okay i have the content ready

00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,710
but supposing I don't know who will be

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:57,850
interested in my session or something

00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:01,270
like that so how do you actually get the

00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,310
people that you want like how do you

00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:10,270
like find out like who can be interested

00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:12,790
in such an event hello okay now this is

00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:20,380
indeed the D startup issue right let me

00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:22,750
try and go back to the beginning so how

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:27,130
do you get people let me see yes so what

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:29,950
where and how basically did this is the

00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,990
part why I said start small because word

00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:34,810
of mouth is one of the best ways of

00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:36,520
promoting it and trying to organize a 50

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:40,630
people meeting the first time you do a

00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,030
meeting is just crazy don't start with

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,130
friends co-workers family seriously

00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,260
people you know that's the easiest way

00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,790
of course put it on your own Twitter

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:52,120
account of Facebook and all that stuff

00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:53,590
and try meetup com there are a couple of

00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,510
occluding meet up but there are a couple

00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:58,420
of websites that actually help you with

00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:01,960
this just Google around a little bit and

00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:05,080
use those and don't expect too much from

00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,810
the first meeting you know if 57 people

00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,280
show up really that's fine because the

00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,380
next sound there might be eight and then

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,020
10 and you know before you know it there

00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:16,320
are 50 people and if they're done if

00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:21,550
there are not I mean it's fine to write

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:23,980
so yeah I mean it is hard to to reach

00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:26,230
the right people but that's mostly

00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:28,120
startup issue once you have a bit of

00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,610
something going on and it has a clear

00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,220
you know think that it is about and a

00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,260
clear identity that's all so I said you

00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:37,540
know you need to have a focus the more

00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:39,790
you have an identity the easier it is

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:43,630
for people to recognize what your event

00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:46,230
is about and to come to it so yeah

00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:48,930
combination of not too big ambitions

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:53,250
and a clear focus is what what solves

00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:59,430
the chicken egg problem I think any more

00:38:53,250 --> 00:39:01,290
questions well that's it then thank you

00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:04,520
very much and this is also pretty much

00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:04,520
