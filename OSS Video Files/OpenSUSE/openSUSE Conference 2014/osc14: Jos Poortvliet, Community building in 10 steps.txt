Title: osc14: Jos Poortvliet, Community building in 10 steps
Publication date: 2014-04-28
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Building a community is a lot of work and there is much you have to keep in mind. This talk will present 10 steps to building your own community.

Building a community has two sides: a practical and a organizational. Practically, you have to get something people can rally around. Code you work on is an obvious first but you want to build a local meet-up, you look for subjects for talks, articles, things to do like a installfest or theme evenings.

When building up a community, governance is another thing to think about. Should there be rules? What rules? Who should be in charge, or should nobody be in charge? The answers to these questions have far reaching consequences on the future of a project.
