Title: osc14: Robert Schweikert, openSUSE in the Public Cloud
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	The Cloud and especially Public Cloud is on every ones mind. In this talk I will examine where we are with openSUSE w.r.t providing images for the Cloud to let people use the awesome distribution we create. I will also examine some of the infrastructure behind the images, show where and how the images are built in the build service and speak about the tools required to interact with the public cloud.

all right here we are now we have sound

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:10,620
too excellent well welcome I will be

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:15,170
talking about opensuse in the public

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:20,630
cloud cloud what what's that thing

00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:25,109
produces rain right ugly gray stuff

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:28,349
anyway so let's see this is why we talk

00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:33,390
about something about me just for fun

00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:36,660
why not what is it and why you might

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,649
want it where do we stand today with

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,120
opensuse and the cloud stuff well public

00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,129
cloud stuff so there's a difference

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,539
between what these guys do and what I do

00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:52,649
how things are put together so we'll

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:55,680
take a look at you know what do we do to

00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,600
get there and then how it works and if

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,699
you have questions then I will be more

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,170
than happy to answer them when we come

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,879
to the end but if you have questions in

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,030
between please feel free to interrupt me

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,720
and I will try to answer them as good as

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,549
I can alright something about me I work

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,830
at Sousa in the eyes of the engineering

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:15,299
team what is the eyes of engineering

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,630
team is three states were independent

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:21,420
software vendor so I work with people

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,729
that are generally outside of the open

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:27,290
source community proprietary

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:30,869
applications and things like that and

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:33,360
but that has become a lot less of my job

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:37,650
since I started taking over the public

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,560
cloud initiative and public cloud

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,649
basically means anywhere where you see

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,049
souza linux enterprise in the public

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,310
cloud that means Amazon Google and so on

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,500
I had my fingers in it I am also the IBM

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,360
software group liaison that means I work

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,189
closely with IBM if they have questions

00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,430
they come and ask me and I help them

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:02,040
along the way with suse linux questions

00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,549
and integrated systems are basically

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,399
things that we put together with ISVs

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:11,489
where they create an appliance which

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,620
means the application is already part of

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,940
the image that you might get and

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,190
and you can just install it in your

00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:20,430
virtual infrastructure so those are the

00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:24,780
things that work on during dollar day

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:27,450
job I also contribute to Kiwi Kiwi is an

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:30,900
image builder that is the backend of

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,720
Susa studio and I have a workshop

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,200
tomorrow no on Monday about how to build

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,049
images with Kiwi what I do for opensuse

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,750
I maintain packages I am a board member

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:45,090
and generally opinionated about pretty

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:49,379
much any discussion that goes on on most

00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:53,549
opensuse mailing lists so I have my

00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:55,730
fingers in all of the sockets and I'm

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:59,640
very passionate about motorcycling and

00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,829
soccer and every chance i get when the

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,269
weather is nice you will not reach me

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,200
because then i will be sitting on my

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,930
motorcycle riding around the world ok so

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,810
what is it this is what i decided at

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,400
this because i came up i came to the

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,500
conclusion that i can just as well

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,239
decide what the public cloud is like

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,180
everybody else that makes up their own

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,419
stuff and so i decided i can make up my

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,060
own statement and here it is ok a public

00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:30,959
cloud provides access to computing

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,410
resources ye that is available to

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,879
everybody for some kind of interface

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,069
usually that's a web application so

00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,739
amazon.com as a web application to

00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:43,709
access their public cloud as does Google

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:48,530
as does HPS does Microsoft and many

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:52,019
other providers okay so the key here is

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:53,519
public everybody can use it you get an

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,069
account there you give them your credit

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,660
card number and then you're on the

00:03:56,069 --> 00:04:03,329
public cloud train okay the frameworks

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,220
are different which means not just the

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:07,019
web application that you see but also

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,000
the underlying technology is very

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,419
different from one cloud provider to the

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,720
next for us that means we have to deal

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:19,500
with the differences in the underlying

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,349
technology behind the web interface okay

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,680
that means opens loser has to have

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:27,260
different images and these images get

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,790
built with kiwi

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:34,520
okay some key words when I say vm that's

00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:36,950
a virtual machine when the vm is

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:44,620
actually running we talk about it being

00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:49,250
an instance and what else instances are

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:54,050
deployed from images okay so what's next

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:56,720
so what is it well there you go we are

00:04:54,050 --> 00:05:00,080
all connected to the cloud whether you

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,300
think you're using it or will then well

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,940
you are using it okay you have a gmail

00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,760
account you're using a cloud all your g

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:12,290
all your mail everything is stored in

00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:14,540
the Google cloud okay almost everything

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:19,240
these days runs through some kind of

00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:23,840
cloud framework your phone calls yes

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,730
Google searches obviously right you go

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,650
to Amazon and you want to buy something

00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:33,530
that runs in the cloud Amazon's web shop

00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:36,320
where you buy stuff runs on amazon web

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,420
services which is their cloud

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,780
implementation okay so Amazon is a

00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,830
customer of itself by using the Amazon

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:49,550
public cloud to run their their store

00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,640
basically and so we all connect it to

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,260
the cloud in some way shape or form

00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:58,370
maybe your pictures in Flickr or

00:05:54,260 --> 00:06:01,910
whatever else um SlideShare anybody yes

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:05,800
cloud okay so everything is running on

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,660
some kind of framework these days so

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,270
what might you want to do with it or why

00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,080
you might want it okay so if you're

00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,000
building code using the cloud if you can

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:21,020
build fast enough on your local machine

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,240
or you need to run some tests you can do

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,650
that in the cloud is generally generally

00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,840
pretty cheap okay if you want to test

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,360
something and you say well I don't want

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,100
to mess with my local machine and for

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,650
example if you don't have butter fess

00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,430
with snapper and yours afraid that you

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,840
might mess up your root filesystem right

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,600
fire up an instance in the cloud and

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,790
install away and then if it breaks then

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,500
well nothing happened you just delete it

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:54,260
and cost you a couple pennies and you're

00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:57,550
done okay you can also host a service so

00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,710
there are a lot of startup companies and

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:04,610
established companies that use public

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:07,600
clouds to you know host the services

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:11,419
hosted product Netflix for example

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,030
provides all the videos through the

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:15,860
cloud and they're a huge customer of

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,460
Amazon so all of Netflix's

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,750
infrastructure runs on amazon netflix

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,520
themselves own very little hardware

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,500
compared to the hardware that they would

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,760
need if they would host the service

00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:30,320
themselves okay you can also use the

00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:34,130
public are to become an expert and get a

00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,410
job because cloud is all the range and

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:39,110
so you know if you become an expert

00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:42,710
there I am sure there is a job out there

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:45,250
for you if you look at you can also use

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,900
the cloud to just store your backup data

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,370
so you can shovel all your stuff that

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,140
you have on your machine if you want to

00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,250
back it up you can all shovel it into

00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:57,260
the cloud the cost there is basically

00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,789
the storage you have to pay for and the

00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:02,169
network traffic to get your stuff in

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:06,320
there of course that requires a

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:07,729
relatively fast internet connection so

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,060
those are some of the things you might

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:17,090
want to do with it okay so who who's out

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:19,789
there and what are we doing so the

00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:23,539
elephant in the room is amazon amazon

00:08:19,789 --> 00:08:27,410
web services or AWS with ec2 which

00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:30,729
stands for Elastic Compute cloud is the

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:33,770
largest provider of public cloud today

00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:35,419
and I predict that they will remain the

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,919
largest provider for public cloud

00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,599
services for quite some time to come my

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,900
estimate is that they probably have

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,690
seventy to eighty percent of the market

00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:50,120
primarily because a they were the prime

00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,840
mover so they were really the first guys

00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,340
to do this

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,050
since they started they consistently

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,640
have lowered their prices so it's

00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:03,920
becoming cheaper and cheaper to get

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:06,050
started and get going in the time for

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,470
the other guys to start if they've

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:11,540
accumulated a lot of services so Amazon

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,230
not just doesn't just provide images

00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,840
they also provide services such as a

00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,240
database query and all kinds of

00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,370
functionality that the other guys need

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,200
to catch up with okay so as far as

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,660
functionality is concerned what is

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,480
available in the cloud amazon is a head

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:34,190
off pretty much everybody else they

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:37,070
started earlier so they're ahead google

00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:39,380
just entered this market um although

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,030
Google obviously had their own cloud for

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:48,080
you know many many years storing gmail

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:49,820
pictures blogger you name it as a public

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,020
cloud provider they are really young

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:58,010
they started last year in the fall was

00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:02,020
the announcement they've been growing

00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:05,540
pretty fast they are now three regions

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:09,290
for Google one in the u.s. one in Europe

00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:15,370
and one in Asia amazon currently has

00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:19,910
eight regions um 22 in the US Europe

00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:24,710
three in Asia this Japan and Singapore

00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:26,330
and Australia one in South America so

00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:28,040
they have data centers all around the

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,530
world and each one of those data centers

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,760
is basically a region and each region is

00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:39,410
one cloud instance okay and then there's

00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:42,400
Microsoft with Windows Azure that's also

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:45,770
cloud this is quite different from

00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,590
everybody else but this is where we are

00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,770
today so opensuse when you if you have

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:55,070
an account in any one of these three you

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:59,630
can start and opensuse instance in these

00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:02,090
three clouds okay there are other clouds

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:04,810
that we're working on but you know that

00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:04,810
are not there yet

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,730
yeah so the opensuse instances that are

00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:14,720
there currently is opensuse 13 one most

00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:19,910
of them have just been uploaded recently

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:24,270
and they just work and it's wonderful

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:26,820
okay so where do we stand with the

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,300
images so the images come from the

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:32,340
opensuse build service of course and

00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:34,800
they get built in the cloud images

00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:36,600
project okay so if you go to the open

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,090
through the build service bill that open

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,840
source org you can look for the cloud

00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:47,940
images project and you can see how this

00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:50,970
works by just looking at the names of

00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:54,270
the images ok so the these things that

00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:58,770
are called packages here I'm going to

00:11:54,270 --> 00:12:01,230
use this toy haha so you can see here we

00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:03,720
have an usher guest we have an ec2 guest

00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:07,920
we have a Google compute engine GCE

00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,470
guest and there is no longer an HP and

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:14,490
an OpenStack s because the HP Cloud is

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:16,590
actually based on OpenStack so just a

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:19,530
couple of days before i got here i merge

00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:22,170
these two together the HP guests and the

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:25,560
open to open stockist and while I did

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,480
that I probably broke something so the

00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:33,450
OpenStack stuff needs to be tested a

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:35,340
little bit hint hint and then I need to

00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:38,640
get some reports on that whether it

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,500
works or not so basically this is where

00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,850
the image has come from what happens

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:47,220
then I download them and then to my

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,800
machine and then I log into my accounts

00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,020
in the various clouds and then upload

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:58,980
them and my accounts in this case means

00:12:52,020 --> 00:13:01,800
a souza account so Souza has accounts in

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,420
all of these cloud providers simply for

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,370
the reason because we make Souza linux

00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:07,440
enterprise available and from an

00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,070
opensuse perspective we get to piggyback

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,810
on those accounts so making the images

00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,730
available in the public cloud doesn't

00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,750
actually cost the project any money

00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,000
because we can piggyback on the

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,890
infrastructure that we have and the

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,520
agreements that Souza has with these

00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:28,240
cloud providers okay so generally if you

00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:31,300
and and so this is also somewhat of a

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,610
you know for Crocs is when you do

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,650
something in the open in the public

00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:37,570
cloud it costs money period not

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:40,690
necessarily a whole lot but it costs

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:44,140
money and so while anybody in this room

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:47,170
or anybody in the community can take

00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,450
either these images that I have set up

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,430
or can set up their own images and it

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,620
can upload them to the public cloud and

00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:56,560
it can publish them as open through the

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,450
images they'll just be as official as

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,270
the ones that I'm building so you know

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,180
I'm not putting up any hat and saying I

00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:06,490
do the official images certainly not

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:09,310
anybody can do it the thing is that

00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:11,140
whoever does it they have to pay money

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,880
right because they have to have an

00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,590
account with the cloud provider and you

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,110
have to store the image even if the

00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:20,170
image is public you storing it you

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:23,010
paying for it okay the advantage of me

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:26,230
doing this is that I have access to the

00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,690
sooz accounts and therefore the storage

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:34,630
and stuff doesn't cost me personally or

00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:38,700
the project any money so if we go and

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:41,320
dig in a little bit for example in the

00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:43,630
google image and you can see here it

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:46,570
build it successfully hooray that's what

00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:50,500
we like to see green stuff oh and the

00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:56,770
green pointer wonderful you can see that

00:14:50,500 --> 00:15:00,150
um this is basically a Kiwi set up again

00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:03,400
the images are built with Kiwi okay and

00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:06,730
so we have a configuration file that's a

00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:09,250
script that gets run by kiwi an images

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:12,760
file and again for all these details you

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:15,880
want to come to my workshop and then

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:18,610
this this file with the dot Kiwi ending

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,710
describes the packages that go into the

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:22,750
image that we're building okay and

00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,540
basically the images that we're building

00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:28,420
our minimal images so there's not a

00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:29,900
whole lot of stuff in there if you want

00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,960
to run a web server then

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:36,020
and you fire this thing up and then you

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:40,970
need to run zipper in Apache or whatever

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:43,520
web server you want to run okay what's

00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:47,840
nice about Google I saw at this point

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:52,010
Google actually is also hosting opensuse

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,050
mirrors so when you update an instance

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,400
that you're running Google you're

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,320
getting really good bandwidth because

00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,720
the mirror is right in the same data

00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:02,330
center and it doesn't cost you anything

00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,830
okay because the network traffic is

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,100
within the data center so they don't

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,870
charge I'm still working with Amazon to

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,390
hopefully also be able to provide the

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,340
same service in Amazon where we can set

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,080
up opensuse mirrors in each of the

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,870
Amazon regions and then you would

00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,910
basically get the same service okay but

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:27,820
currently we only have mirrors running

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:30,500
in Google compute engine okay so okay so

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:34,850
how is this stuff put together you just

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:38,150
saw here the Kiwi configuration okay and

00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:41,990
kiwi is fully integrated into OBS which

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:45,200
is the build service of course the Kiwi

00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,950
file contains the packages that we need

00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:51,260
and the repositories were to pull from

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:53,680
config does H makes generic settings for

00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:58,820
example in google it sets up an ntp

00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,620
client to point to the google ntp server

00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,570
that runs within their cloud to make

00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,520
sure that the time is what they expect

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,220
in is accurate okay and there's other

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:11,570
settings that happens and then the root

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:14,000
tarball that you saw that's an overlay

00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:18,290
tree that puts in certain files into the

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,480
image in this case it's pretty empty it

00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:25,550
considers the network configuration so

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:27,320
it sets up ether 0s DHCP and it puts in

00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:30,680
the license files okay which is

00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:34,820
basically what we need and but the rest

00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:37,630
of the image is very basic okay how

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:42,639
works from the image point of view okay

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:45,080
as i mentioned i use

00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:49,909
connected to Souza and therefore there

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:53,869
is no cost to the project and take the

00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:58,429
image from OBS upload the image once the

00:17:53,869 --> 00:18:01,009
image is uploaded I fire it up make sure

00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:06,499
that it boots that I can log in with ssh

00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:08,690
and then I run zipper in or supper up

00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:10,940
just to make sure that the repos are

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,690
there okay and that's about that's all

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,759
the testing i do once that works i'm

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:19,729
happy and then I push the publish button

00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:22,700
and then they're available in you know

00:18:19,729 --> 00:18:29,440
whatever form the various cloud

00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:31,669
providers make them available okay so if

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,830
you want to use the wonderful things

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:37,059
that we do know from OBS then you need

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:41,090
an account with the cloud provider

00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:43,340
amazon has a sign up obviously everybody

00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:46,309
has sign up if you already have a gmail

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:49,119
account then you're known to Google all

00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:52,309
you need to do there is then activate

00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:54,200
the google compute engine service which

00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:57,320
means you have to hand google your

00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,539
credit card which they might already

00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:04,099
have anyway so you know they're not

00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:05,899
revealing many secrets to google and of

00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:08,809
course amazon wants your credit card and

00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:10,070
so would microsoft and everybody else so

00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:14,470
from that point of view they're all the

00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:17,869
same then you launch an instance from

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:21,229
the whatever cloud service you're using

00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:25,399
from their web console okay so it's a

00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:27,320
web UI and I will we should have plenty

00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:32,509
of times I can show you at least the

00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:35,690
Amazon UI and maybe the google one and

00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:40,970
then once it's launched then you can

00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:44,919
login via SSH okay um there's no guey

00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:47,419
it's just a remote shell basically

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:49,609
obviously you can get a remotely if you

00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:53,220
want you can install an x server in the

00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:55,350
thing and then you can you know do SSH

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,990
X and you can get remote display if you

00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,690
want to GUI but if you really want to

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,240
GUI then the cloud is not necessarily

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:05,789
something that is for you right it's

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:09,990
really primarily command-line driven

00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:13,980
okay the command line tools for these to

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:16,169
interact with the clouds are also in the

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,610
build service okay we have tools for

00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:25,350
amazon and for google for amazon that's

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:28,500
called AWS CLI that's the package it

00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,500
provides command line tools to interact

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:35,010
with the cloud okay so you don't

00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,470
actually need to log in with the web

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:41,580
browser and point-and-click if you don't

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,820
want to you can launch instances you can

00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,250
shut them down you can attach disks you

00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:51,080
can do all kinds of stuff all through

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:56,370
these command line tools okay and so am

00:20:51,080 --> 00:21:00,059
there's a project AWS CLI that is

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:02,250
actually in github that's also supported

00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:06,210
by amazon and so they were completely in

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:09,690
the open the that code base is based on

00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:13,020
python bottle or by python bottle core

00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,299
which provides the basic web requests to

00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:17,190
the Amazon interface okay so all you

00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:20,159
need to use those tools is once you have

00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,770
your account you have an access key and

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,919
a secret x XS key and then you can

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:28,080
configure the tools to use that access

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,179
key in a secret access key and you can

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,880
interact with the cloud without ever

00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:36,600
touching your web browser very similar

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:39,929
for Google their tools are a part of

00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,610
what is called Google SDK and there are

00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:44,700
currently two commands that you would

00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:47,100
use which is GSU till and gcutil chi-su

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,490
till is to access the storage back end

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:54,090
and GC util is to access their computing

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:56,340
back end eventually or Google is working

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,370
on integrating them all nicely like

00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:02,640
Amazon did unfortunately that work is

00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:05,250
not happening in public so you can't

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
contribute to that but the code is open

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,490
source and

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,330
will eventually end up on github at some

00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:15,330
point you find the packages they've been

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:20,309
also bended to opensuse factory so 13.2

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:23,390
will have two packages by default for 13

00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:27,230
one you need to add the cloud tools

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:31,980
repository repositories in open tomorrow

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:34,620
oops alright amazon okay as I mentioned

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,870
currently the elephant in the room the

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:42,809
biggest cloud provider a wsdl hi package

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:47,580
and this is how you use it ok it's AWS

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:49,919
and then as a command which is easy to

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:53,340
if you want to interact with the cloud

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,730
ok with their Elastic Compute cloud so

00:22:53,340 --> 00:23:00,290
AWS integrates all of their tools so

00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:03,000
they also have other things like storage

00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:05,580
cloud formations which means you can

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,320
describe how certain things are supposed

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,970
to interact and then they have different

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:16,470
commands for that everybody anybody

00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:19,530
heard of Mechanical Turk yes so there's

00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:22,650
a command line for mechanical turk and

00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:25,260
that's also integrated in AWS ok so you

00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,890
can say AWS Mechanical Turk and then

00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,840
something so if you're doing playing

00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,340
around with Mechanical Turk you can do

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,410
that from the main line and you don't

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,000
have to sit there and click of course if

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,360
you're evaluating pictures you still

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,690
have to see them right anyway so this is

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,910
how you use it AWS ec2 subcommand that

00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,799
could be run instance for example and

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:52,440
then you give it the image that you want

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:55,080
to launch and then off it goes ok so

00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,230
there eight regions and as I mentioned

00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,480
there no opensuse mirrors in in Amazon

00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:02,669
at this point but if we can come to

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,210
agreement with Amazon then I will be

00:24:02,669 --> 00:24:12,230
more than happy to to set up the mirrors

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:16,590
and i will then kindly encourage our

00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,149
opensuse orcses admin team to watch over

00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,960
them once

00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:25,940
have them set up and I know that doryx

00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,379
is very happy about that so Google okay

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,479
as I mentioned Google is the newest

00:24:27,379 --> 00:24:31,639
entry into the public cloud market which

00:24:29,479 --> 00:24:35,149
you know came just in well actually

00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:37,129
almost winter last year you want to

00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:39,349
install the Google Cloud SDK the

00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:42,259
commands Archie see you till in GSU tell

00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:45,710
not fully integrated okay and we

00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:48,739
currently have three regions and here we

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,440
have the opensuse mirrors I don't have a

00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:54,379
mirror in Asia yet but hopefully next

00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:00,889
week when i'm back home and i will be

00:24:54,379 --> 00:25:05,289
able to set that up so Asher yeah what

00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:08,419
can i say about Azure unfortunately

00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:14,269
Microsoft decided to write the command

00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:18,499
line tools in JavaScript so yes note j/s

00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:20,389
and no GS is well let's put it this way

00:25:18,499 --> 00:25:23,269
we basically currently have no

00:25:20,389 --> 00:25:29,359
infrastructure of reasonably packaging

00:25:23,269 --> 00:25:31,219
nodejs scripts in any shape or form the

00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:35,659
good news is that Fedora has all that

00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:38,749
stuff and over the next month or so I

00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:40,700
will do my best to basically copy what

00:25:38,749 --> 00:25:44,450
they've done and bring it over to

00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:49,539
opensuse and then I can start copying or

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:52,479
building packages for the azure CLI

00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:57,200
including the hundred and twenty

00:25:52,479 --> 00:26:00,679
dependencies that they have so yeah

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:06,200
javascript and you know and I thought

00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:08,210
ruby was bad but whatever but if you are

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,950
really interested you can install the

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:16,759
azure seal I from the noches a packaging

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,339
system which is n p.m. and you can just

00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:22,219
run NPM install I think it's called

00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:26,659
asier dash CLI and that will actually

00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:27,929
work but there will not be any packages

00:26:26,659 --> 00:26:32,039
you know for

00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:36,570
for a while the regions in Azure are a

00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:38,639
bit different than the others and it's

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,429
really difficult to compare and so I'm

00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:44,100
not really even going to go in there and

00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:46,409
there are also no opensuse mirrors in

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,299
Azure and I haven't really had a chance

00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:51,480
to talk to Microsoft whether they would

00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:57,629
be amenable to hosting these mirrors or

00:26:51,480 --> 00:27:01,200
not ok and now it says amazon demo okay

00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:04,470
and so I'm going to try and do that but

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:14,220
before I go there let's go here and see

00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:19,740
if there are any questions so far no

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:23,119
okay good then all right now I'm stuck

00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,119
with a genome desktop

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:13,500
have a turbid cable 10 yet it didn't

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:17,960
work did it ha the german keyboard with

00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,960
the u.s. mapping that will be fun people

00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:29,710
all right

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:45,890
I will I'm working on it now working on

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:49,070
go easy with me like a piano player look

00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:52,150
at that okay so what do you see in front

00:28:49,070 --> 00:29:01,340
of you now is I amazon web services

00:28:52,150 --> 00:29:14,540
amazon.com what oh how to do that now

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:23,270
good luck ah ok gnome thank you oops

00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:29,380
where did it go now what is it up down

00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:35,680
oh now went away hmm here it is ok I

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:43,580
can't move it on now maybe no up left

00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:47,450
all right hi ok oh of course now i can't

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:51,710
see bud hi how bad can it be and I

00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:59,180
wanted they don't do buttons for large

00:29:51,710 --> 00:30:03,200
windows huh look at that bigger no no no

00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:06,370
not bigger ok maybe I should sit on the

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,370
other side of the desk now

00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,960
now you get to see the back of me you

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:37,930
don't have to look at my face see look

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:42,720
at that all right so this is where we

00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:46,750
are so this is a WS at amazon com and

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:52,960
what happened to the mouse also on the

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:56,230
other screen right there is alray thank

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,090
you okay so you can see a sign up button

00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:00,220
here obviously so if you wouldn't have

00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:02,380
an account you would go there I do

00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:18,540
happen to have an account so I go right

00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:21,870
there and yep and then we go here hmm

00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:26,500
what did we say it was a US keyboard

00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:31,450
with no a German know a Croatian

00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:41,680
keyboard with us mapping that means I

00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:44,070
should be here yay okay now have to

00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,070
remember that

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:56,720
let's see if that works no certainly

00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:59,630
don't remember that okay and so now you

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,370
see all the services that amazon offers

00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:08,900
ok so there's database stuff dynamo

00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:12,080
database elastic cash all kinds of stuff

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:15,740
cloud formation that's a tool where you

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,620
can orchestrate various um virtual

00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:21,890
machines to work together for example

00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:24,260
okay um then there's application which

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:29,540
goes into the platform as a service

00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:31,850
direction and so on so these are all the

00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:36,410
services that Amazon office then there's

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:40,340
for example as just storage um s3 is an

00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:43,280
object storage back end and when you

00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:46,240
have Amazon images they can be either s3

00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:50,210
based which is this simple storage or

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,270
EBS EBS is called elastic box storage

00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:55,310
and EBS is actually persistent so as

00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,050
long as you don't delete the instance

00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:59,300
that you're running but you just stop it

00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:01,040
any changes that you make will be

00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,770
persistent the next time you boot it up

00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:07,130
if you terminate the instance then those

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:09,050
changes go away ok by default but you

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,550
can change that when you launch the

00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:16,190
instance ok so what I wanted to show is

00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:20,000
ec2 which stands for Elastic Compute

00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:24,560
cloud so you go there and you can see

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,330
this is loading and so then you're this

00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,250
is the console that's presented to you

00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:32,060
and you can see here this is me hooray

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:34,190
and currently I am operating in this

00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:36,860
cloud or in this region which is

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:40,010
Northern Virginia and if I click on that

00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,770
you can see all the regions that amazon

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,890
has also to make things a bit quicker

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:48,740
we're going to choose EU which happens

00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:51,890
to be in Ireland and you can see that I

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:54,020
have two running instances there and if

00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,730
I click on that you can see that this is

00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:58,610
not as successful as I would like it to

00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:59,600
be because one of them is giving me this

00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:04,460
little

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,320
I'm not working sign so if I wanted to

00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:09,260
launch an instance then you go simply to

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,609
launch that I'm very clearly and then

00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:14,480
the first thing that you're presented

00:34:10,609 --> 00:34:17,050
with you can see here is the Amazon

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,940
partners so these are basically the

00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:23,960
offerings from Amazon you can see the

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:26,869
suse linux enterprise there's the amazon

00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,600
image themselves and other linux

00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:33,649
distributions what we want to look for

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,540
is community am is okay and then you can

00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:39,730
see they have all kinds of community am

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:42,530
eyes and then tada here is us opensuse

00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:45,290
you of course we know they can't spell

00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:49,280
but they shall be forgiven for that and

00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:53,270
we click on that and lo and behold there

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:57,170
is opensuse 13.1 and you will notice

00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:59,390
that there is a 64-bit image simply for

00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:01,790
the reason that there is not really an

00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:05,210
advantage to have 32-bit and 64-bit

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:08,200
images it makes no sense so I decided to

00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:13,369
just have 64-bit images because you know

00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:16,640
32-bit is really old and nobody uses it

00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:18,710
anymore so you select that and then once

00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,600
you're there you get to see what kind of

00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:22,609
instance type you want to use you can

00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:26,030
see they are micro instances these are

00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:28,400
free um they can run for a certain

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:31,609
period of time and you get a certain

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,100
amount of free time the thing with this

00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:37,550
is you know you get up to two virtual

00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,470
CPU well one virtual CPUs on this is the

00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:42,050
amount of memory you get so you can see

00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:46,940
this is a whopping point 6 3 gigabytes

00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:49,609
one but it's free and what else see see

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:54,350
here you can see that the network

00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:57,650
performance basically sucks then these

00:35:54,350 --> 00:36:00,800
are other instances that you can choose

00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:03,859
so we're just going to go for a general

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:08,330
purpose which is small so general

00:36:03,859 --> 00:36:10,700
purpose small instance type 1 cpu 1.7

00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:13,490
gigabytes of memory this is the storage

00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:18,380
that you get on in addition

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:20,690
to the root volume so the root volumes

00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:23,330
are 10 gigabytes big so if you need to

00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:25,520
install any application or whatever you

00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:27,530
want to attach a second volume so that

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,869
you have application storage because the

00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:34,490
root volume is only 10 gigabytes that's

00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:38,540
not going to go very far ok and then you

00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:40,160
go so then we continue to configure I'll

00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:43,850
we're going to launch it into ec2

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,780
classic the availability zone we don't

00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:50,150
really care the shutdown behavior you

00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,760
can see you can change that you can say

00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,890
to stop the instance or to terminate it

00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,660
again if you just stop the instance and

00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:58,640
any changes that you made to the root

00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:00,890
volume or persistence so the next time

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,670
you boot it those changes will be there

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:08,119
if you terminate the instance then

00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:10,130
everything is lost ok well if that's

00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,660
also configurable but by default the

00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:16,880
images are set up so that everything

00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:19,250
goes away ok and that was that then you

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,109
could add stores if you want or not so

00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:23,690
we're going to just continue on this and

00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:29,990
you can see you get some helpful hints

00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:32,420
from amazon and you can see so security

00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:34,760
groups means basically amazon creates a

00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,230
firewall for you that sits in front of

00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,380
the instance that you're running it's in

00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:40,670
front of the network ok and this fire

00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:46,340
while you configure through these

00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:48,109
security groups currently on it will

00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:51,200
create a new security group for me

00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:55,100
that's called launch wizard too and that

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:58,220
security group will have on 422 open

00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,290
from any IP address ok so when this is

00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,200
running I can actually log in from here

00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:07,130
and not just from some specific machine

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:10,790
all right so this is not really a demo

00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,619
about the amazon web console so i'm just

00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,540
going to keep going and since i'm the

00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:17,450
only one that's standing between you and

00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:20,060
the ends of the day I'm better hurry ok

00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:22,220
so what you do is you have to have a key

00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,490
bear this is yeah SSH key pair that gets

00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:26,150
injected into the instance so you have

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,160
to have that

00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:30,049
and of course i won't have this on this

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,049
machine so i won't be able to login but

00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:34,609
i can show you that is running okay and

00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:36,559
then you acknowledge that you have to

00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:39,170
have that keeper here and then you

00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:41,270
launch the instance and yes if I would

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:42,980
use my laptop for the demo I could

00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:44,569
actually log in but if I would do that

00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,819
and you couldn't see anything because

00:38:44,569 --> 00:38:48,950
our recording boxes usually don't deal

00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:50,990
well with the video output that my

00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:55,400
laptop produces so that's why I'm

00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:57,260
running on their machine okay so then

00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,029
you get this wonderful message and then

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,279
you can view your instances and what you

00:38:59,029 --> 00:39:04,039
can see so as you notice previously I

00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:05,839
had these two running and now you can

00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:07,730
see there's one being launched this is

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,420
pending and it's waiting for

00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:14,990
initialization and this will spin for a

00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,000
little bit and then this will change to

00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:20,089
running and then eventually you will see

00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:23,119
the t22 greenboxes and again if I had my

00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:25,940
ssh key on this machine then i could ssh

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:29,180
login to the machine and that's really

00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:31,400
all I have and so maybe now there are

00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:57,039
some questions and if not then you can

00:39:31,400 --> 00:40:01,010
be released so um say if you wanted to

00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:03,520
customize your instance dynamically

00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:09,529
using some configuration management

00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:13,910
system how would you go back doing that

00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:16,309
so the first thing you would so if you

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:20,420
use a plain opensuse image then you

00:40:16,309 --> 00:40:22,720
would have to start with this step then

00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:25,910
you can install chef or puppet and then

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,000
configure that to pull your stuff from a

00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,010
server and once it's set up the only the

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,670
only key that you have to do is to just

00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:35,690
stop the instance instead of terminated

00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:37,670
while it's stopped you're not

00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:39,830
accumulating any usage hours so it's

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,900
free but it's there and

00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:44,270
and when you restarted your chef or a

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:46,610
puppet configuration is already there

00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:50,600
and then you can just send whatever you

00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:53,570
need to send and if you wanted to do it

00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,260
by building your own image that has that

00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:59,450
support in so then you can go to the

00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:02,240
opensuse bill service you can make a

00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:06,560
copy you can branch my packet there the

00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,440
package you can add puppet or chef into

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,900
the kiwi configuration file and then you

00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,600
can just build it in your in your

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:18,590
project and then upload it to your to

00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:21,230
your account and the way to get the

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:24,110
images in theirs in the key week so the

00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:26,020
Kiwi documentation actually has a

00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:29,630
step-by-step instructions on how you

00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:32,360
either create an s3 based image or an

00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:34,580
EBS based image from the output of what

00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:37,160
you get from from the bill service so

00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:40,010
that's all well documented that kind of

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:46,520
brings me nicely onto another question

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:49,550
which is with the those Kiwi images that

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:52,100
you had in the build service and it's

00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:55,900
all the sources for those like the

00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:58,430
config.xml and the and the root tar.gz

00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:02,870
we're all just stored directly in the

00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:05,000
OBS project yum is there a way of having

00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:07,010
those saying github and then using a

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,990
source service to bring them in and

00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:14,180
still have OBS build those I yeah we

00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:16,880
could do that but so far I haven't seen

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:19,490
the need to do that because it's just as

00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:24,230
easy for somebody to just make copy pack

00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:27,130
in OBS or do you know branch the project

00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:30,020
and get up into their own account so

00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:31,820
actually if you do copy pack then it's

00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:35,300
easier for you to keep the diff just in

00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:37,730
OBS and if you haven't in github then I

00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:41,020
mean yeah I'm not really planning to

00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:45,050
make many changes to these images um

00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:47,420
changes would only happen when you know

00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,520
13-2 comes out and we have new package

00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:52,160
names for certain things those who

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,650
really be the owners that happen here in

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,020
cloud

00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:58,440
images yeah i was thinking more like if

00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:00,119
i wanted to fault that and and then do

00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,680
something more complicated with it and i

00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,950
wanted to track all those changes with

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,930
get and use you know the standard

00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:09,119
benefits of github yeah yeah i mean you

00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:12,359
know we can certainly set something up

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,220
in in github in the open zoo in the

00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:16,680
opens was a project and stick it there

00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,109
and keep the sources there I you know

00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,640
that's fine with me item not as i said

00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:24,029
i'm not planning on touching it that

00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:28,500
often and whether i keep it in github or

00:43:24,029 --> 00:43:29,520
in OBS is the same to me yeah i was just

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,980
wondering whether there's any

00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:35,130
fundamental limitation on the way the

00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:37,740
OBS builds images from projects

00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:39,420
containing kiwi config that privet would

00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:42,390
prevent you from doing that using a

00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,279
sorceress yeah the fundamental

00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,740
difference is that for kiwi you don't

00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:49,980
expect the tarball so i can't still

00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:53,279
can't use the source service because it

00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:58,460
has to have the dot kiwi file in in as a

00:43:53,279 --> 00:44:02,940
as a plane file in the configuration um

00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:05,700
but i don't i don't think the source

00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:10,190
service deals with that today you could

00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:13,470
use maybe tar SCM with disabled run mode

00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:15,930
maybe yeah i don't know i haven't looked

00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:19,319
into it but I mean theoretically it

00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:22,500
should be puzzle and if not I mean you

00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:25,680
know it can still be in github and I can

00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:27,329
remember that you know so I mean it's

00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,730
not that it's not really that big of

00:44:27,329 --> 00:44:31,950
deal it can be done okay may not be

00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:35,609
automatic with sore service but it's you

00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:38,670
know it can still be done so any other

00:44:35,609 --> 00:44:42,480
questions and as you can see by now this

00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:47,039
has been running and which is this first

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:51,180
instance here and it has two checks and

00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:53,339
now if we go and click on this then you

00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:57,000
can see some information about that

00:44:53,339 --> 00:45:03,960
instance and I can actually make this

00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:06,390
bigger and so here's a public dns entry

00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,510
that you can now use and

00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:14,039
you know SSH dash I the path to my

00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:18,799
private key and then route at that thing

00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:18,799
