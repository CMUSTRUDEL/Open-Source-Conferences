Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	The Cloud and especially Public Cloud is on every ones mind. In this talk I will examine where we are with openSUSE w.r.t providing images for the Cloud to let people use the awesome distribution we create. I will also examine some of the infrastructure behind the images, show where and how the images are built in the build service and speak about the tools required to interact with the public cloud.
