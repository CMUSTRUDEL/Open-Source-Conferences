such this one or to present something at

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:32,040
another city you pay your expenses from

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,020
your pocket all right so you promote

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,009
something that you don't have income out

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:41,090
of it we are here to help you at least

00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:45,420

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:48,299
traveling and accommodation what happens

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:51,600
do we cover conferences like this one

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,479
presentation specialty such as software

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,570
freedom day all you have to do is to

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,590
register your event you see the wiki

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:04,409
page their advocate event usually the

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,030
conference that's this one it's an extra

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,140
budget so you don't have to worry about

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:12,540
it who can apply for a sponsorship

00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:14,400

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,790
advocate is over

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:21,360
you see the wiki fades a member again

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,250
you can see how you can become a member

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,740
people that contribute to open source we

00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:32,980
have to ask you what you did all this

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:37,569
time from last for example last ONC to

00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:39,790
this one so we can sponsor you send us

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:42,130
the your request so you spread the word

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,489
and also ask for marketing promo

00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:51,580
materials I think that it's not our

00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:56,709
responsibility right ok some rules so

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:59,019
all the rules can be found at this wiki

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,720
page read carefully before you apply

00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,150
before because there are some some rules

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,269
you have to follow first of all register

forget to hit when you apply don't

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:18,280

most of you say that I applied but you

00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,579

00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:26,860
sponsorship that submit the button I

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:30,850
think anger will tell you later about

organization of the conference if you if

00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:09,880
PSP is true i think if this is for

programmers you know the more than me go

00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:18,000

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,000
money or not ok

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:28,370
be careful don't ask for more money that

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,930
you should spend there are more people

00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:37,670
that we can the sponsor also if the

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:44,740
approval is for an amount don't spend

00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:47,990
less than this amount how you can apply

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:56,090

tell you later how to do it and we

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:30,100
finish with some fiscal details visible

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:33,850
can tell you more about it just before

00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:39,910
who knows the TSP our program already

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,910
coming okay so i can say out loud them

00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:48,410
as you know who have accorded correct

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:53,330
budget for opensuse Travis part program

00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:57,230
so Sue's sponsor us with some amount and

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,750
you need to use them per quarter the

00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:02,900
thing is when you have conference like

00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:07,430
opensuse conference or summat we have an

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:10,060
extra budget has stat said and then we

00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:14,390
try to make our best to have as many

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:19,580
people as possible attending summit and

00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:22,000
conference some things that we we have

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,090
been facing for the past three years

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:31,850
because tsp as a program has two years

00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:33,230
right no no officially too yeah also two

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,200
years but we

00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:38,510
we are work you know something like this

00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:44,930
for the past four years I believe since

00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:50,750
2011 three years and a half yeah 2011 I

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:55,820
think yes what's happened when you apply

00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:59,390
for for for sponsorship you must say

00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:04,340
where are you leaving because we will

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:07,610
always check about your trip we always

00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:13,040
going to find out if the amount that you

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:17,270
are are asking is the real amount and we

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:22,220
tend to decline people that try to over

00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:25,610
budget I mean if your trip should be

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:29,360
something around like 400 euros and then

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:33,560
you put their thousand I'm sorry even

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:40,630
having the budget we we will decline why

00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:43,040
is that exactly last year we did that

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:48,770
it's not a matter of money as a matter

00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:52,000
of trust that's the point so you guys

00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:54,560
know that you send some requests and

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,650
these conference was a bit different

00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,800
form than before the ones that used to

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:05,060
to us for sponsorship knows that we try

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,540
to make the provoke biggest as possible

00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,910
and this time we had to make a bit lower

00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:14,150
than we planned because we had more

00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:17,840
people the point is like this year we

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:20,780
had 25 people sponsored by TSP to come

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:25,430
here last year to go talkin to the

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:27,620
conference we had 18 people okay we had

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,520
more budget last a year so that's why we

00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,710
were able to sponsor like eight percent

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,150
of the trip and this time we had to be

00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:41,240
in between forty and sixty percent it's

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,820
a lot of money we know but to make it

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:48,630
easier for everyone to to come

00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:52,770
well um another thing we cannot make

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,380
umber sment without receipts okay it's

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:58,830
not possible there's no way it's not

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,880
because I don't want status Marcel or

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:05,459
the best me and Kostas is because Suzy

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,990
won't pay they won't give us the

00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:10,800
embarrassment if you don't show the

00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:14,910
receipts so quite a car bill is not a

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,149
received okay that does so us that you

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,700
spend the money but that's not what we

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:25,350
need that's why you need to keep your

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:30,690
receipts all of them sometimes for a few

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:34,290
Saints we can cover the difference but

00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:37,680
we need to stick at the amount that we

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:40,140
approved because you would say okay just

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:46,709
twenty cents but 10 times twenty cents

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:48,570
it's 200 you know like become a lot of

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,060
money after that's the point you know

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,730
like many times few cents to be a lot of

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:56,820
money so we cannot give there's more

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:59,970
difference even in small so instead some

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,089
case we we can work on the situation cuz

00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:06,770
transfer money for Asia sometimes it's

00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:09,120
really hard so the whole bank system

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:11,610
we're gonna lose a lot of money in

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,300
between so from our side for people

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,820
there to receive the money so sometimes

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,150
you can work with the difference but we

00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:26,029
will try to get sick it on the amount

00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:30,329
approved okay um another important thing

00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:34,079
and if you applied okay you were

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:36,930
sponsored and then do the conference is

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,550
here you are here but the Congress has

00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,920
five days and you are here for two days

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:45,660
ok we're going to emboss you but you

00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:49,290
never get in support from nuts again be

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,279
sure we know people we know each other

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:56,010
and if we don't know someone else knows

00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,270
okay dad that's the point so be fair

00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,270
with the project

00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,490
this is not ESP money it is not just

00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:05,250
Susie giving mine it's not just the

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:08,550
board money this is commute money if you

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:14,480
are here someone else is not so be fair

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:19,380
if the money that you get ok so about

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:23,610
last year I did a report it opensuse

00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:28,350
conference we had a lot of delays about

00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:31,350
the investment the dimber sment now most

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:35,970
of things are on track again we don't

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:39,420
want to do have more than 40 days to

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,610
inverse you back might happen but that's

00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:48,390
not the point we will try to stick in 30

00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:51,380
days but max top 40 days ok oh we

00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:55,530
consider the last day of the conference

00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:58,770
until two weeks after they the deadline

00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,980
for you to send your embracement request

00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:04,560
why is that because we have a long

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,320
process after we need to have you all

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,510
all the receipts everything give you the

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:13,800
money hit a budget sent to Susie Susie

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:17,040
needs to approve and after approved need

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,200
to check with opens who's team inside

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,590
Sue's if everything is ok if you still

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,840
have in the budget and then go to a

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:27,600
pitiable department so it's a long

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:31,980
process if you take too long you be

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,860
instead of 40 days would be you know 10

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:39,720
months so that's why we try to make all

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:42,180
together so who expect everyone to send

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,800
to us two weeks and then you can work in

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,590
the whole process together and dancing

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,600
all the process to susan there they will

00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:54,810
work at the same time and then it'd be

00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:59,010
easier for all of us ok we had some some

00:12:54,810 --> 00:13:01,230
not a real late investment from les

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,460
conference and I believe people that

00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:08,130
needed for summit head the later get him

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,600
verse 2 so I'm sorry this unfortunately

00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,600
happened we hope these

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,459
won't happen again and I hope you guys

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:23,199
is you trust the problem okay so after

00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:26,980
all um opens to the summit console I'm

00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:30,029
in Mexico she sucked summit fosston

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:32,800
scale latino air and officers conference

00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:38,199
are the events that we sponsored since

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:41,649
last July okay a total of twelve people

00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:46,149
for their that events besides ask I'm

00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:49,170
sorry i forgot to raise those are the

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,540
countries that we had people

00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:58,120
participating at the conference and

00:13:52,540 --> 00:14:00,639
asking for for support it's really

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:04,870
interesting as last year mostly were

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:08,110
from latina mech and now besides Latino

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,620
air we had a guy going there to talking

00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:15,240
about this was just one mostly from from

00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:17,199
Europe so and we want to show that

00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,319
there's a matter your country doesn't

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,930
matter where you leave everyone

00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:28,029
sometimes needs support so it's not a

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:31,990
flame it's not a problem no in now 25

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:34,990
people and it's a big deal cos we're

00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:40,509
gonna have some summits around the world

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:42,300
and we will support some cementing some

00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:47,589
place in the world in the end soon was

00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:50,529
released and you guys will be able to

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:53,199
ask for sponsorship if you cannot go pay

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:55,899
by ourselves and then we will make our

00:14:53,199 --> 00:15:03,250
best to help you to attend this kind of

00:14:55,899 --> 00:15:07,180
event ok ah just to finish we have just

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:11,110
for you to know five thousand dollars

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:14,259
per quarter but in case of conference

00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:18,339
like here we increase the budget like

00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:22,630
10000 euros if is in Europe if he's in

00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:24,130
u.s. is five thousand dollars in Latin

00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,900
America it's

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:32,060
dollars tool in Asia we are under

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:34,630
discussion about do mode so that's it I

00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,030
don't know if you have questions please

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:42,640
besides the tool that anchor will tell

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,640
us later anyone any question

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:03,269
just one question here you mentioned we

00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:06,209
have the travel support bad read by

00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:09,240
called her does it mean if the people

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:13,500
attend the events and apply for travel

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,680
support which event happened the at the

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:24,720
beginning of this quarter will got much

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:31,079
more chance to get our support i cannot

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:34,529
i would say that that's the thing is are

00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:37,649
we try to to list all the events around

00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:41,160
toward at least most of the events at

00:16:37,649 --> 00:16:44,040
the famous events something like that so

00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:47,910
far we have more budget than events

00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:51,630
attended but the things might be

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:57,300
changing and time soon so we recorded is

00:16:51,630 --> 00:17:00,149
not when we approved the request the

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:03,209
money use it it's about a mix between

00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:08,870
the quarter profit and accorded that we

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:11,730
will Kimber's so if your event is in

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:14,429
seven months from now would be like two

00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:16,949
different colors you can be approved so

00:17:14,429 --> 00:17:19,410
we need to take care of the moment of

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:23,549
the investment not the moment of the

00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:27,540
request okay if happened that we need to

00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:31,860
use a bit more of that budget in case

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:34,290
then the board can our board open-source

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,150
board can can deal with the difference

00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:37,950
trying to change a bit of the budget

00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:42,090
from one side for the other side and so

00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:44,880
it's it's manageable it's like hell 1001

00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:48,030
make difference we can help but the body

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,410
you need to change few things to help us

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:54,750
to be supporting conference so won't

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:59,340
change that's not a problem it can

00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:04,200
request any time and he questioned early

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:06,210
won't make you have a profitable thank

00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,100
you i asked this question just because

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,090
when the people would

00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:15,150
like to apply for support from your team

00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm not sure he have a dealer about how

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:21,350
many events of which events will happen

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:25,049
in this quarter actually yeah usually

00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:27,690
you just know the biggest events right

00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:30,510
but if you are thinking about moments

00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:33,240
like okay someone from your team wants

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:35,160
to go for our university to make a tall

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,020
can give some make some party like

00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,200
religious Patterson's like that of

00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:43,140
course is not planning before but that

00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:47,429
is a mix between marketing budget and

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:50,130
tess p budget so that's why we we try to

00:18:47,429 --> 00:18:52,289
be sticking on our budget and then if

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:55,380
it's needed the board can convey now the

00:18:52,289 --> 00:18:58,280
budget to make easier for those cuz more

00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,679
related to marketing been related to

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:04,890
sponsor an event someone to go to depend

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:11,090
so that's the it's manageable okay don't

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:15,900
worry we can do it d i have a question

00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:23,370
yeah it's my wife here no okay you can

00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:25,950
do that so it would be nice to say to

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:30,590
people if you know that and I know that

00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:34,770
you know so how what are the criteria

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:38,220
maybe you should maybe I should like to

00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:40,200
explain the criteria of the sponsorship

00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:43,289
and the percentage of the sponsorship

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:47,940
because that's important thank you the

00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:53,070
feeling around okay so hmm don't make

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:56,309
easier and now we are three on the team

00:19:53,070 --> 00:20:00,809
before just to so first to take a

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:02,100
decision who to sponsor we vote so we

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:04,770
both like okay let's see the

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:08,370
contributions let's see what the person

00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:11,400
is involved with something like that so

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:14,250
we first make her like a scan to know

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:20,460
about the person open suse life that's

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:21,890
what you do first after that we would do

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,860
all together

00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:27,260
the thing is if someone from like I'm

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:32,060
Brazilian if someone from Brazil is

00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:35,450
making a request I won't interfere in

00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:39,560
the process so I won't vote for that

00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,570
person to not became do not became like

00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,130
personal war to bring my friend because

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,200
I like my friend I was my friend with

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,500
the comforts with me so I cannot vote

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:52,370
for someone from the same place from the

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:55,280
same country okay in this case like now

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,370
we are three it's easier but before when

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,980
I was me and cost us we asked for the

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:05,000
board to help us so if like some Greeks

00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:07,400
apply then I went to the board and say

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,540
hey can you help him here so that the

00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:14,930
board voted with me instead oh oh Kostas

00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,540
voting for Greeks in Brazilians case was

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:20,900
the same that's why now we decide to

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:25,400
have more speed more why chance of

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:29,210
requests okay about the amount it

00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:34,150
depends like if we if we have a rich

00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:37,970
event we can go to up to eight percent

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:40,610
if you don't have a rich event that that

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:45,980
means you don't have much money much

00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:49,610
budget for TSP we try to make the best

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:53,090
possible like we are always in between

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:56,030
ok let's approve everybody with less

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:59,750
money or let's cut off some people and

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:01,840
give more sponsorship and our decision

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:05,690
this time was to give that money right

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:09,260
so to bring more people in the meaning

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:13,240
of here is a place that we don't have

00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:17,570
much opensuse round it's a totally new

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:19,250
land for us so that's that was was

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,730
that's why it was important to bring

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:25,160
more people instead of helping

00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:27,820
financially less people so that was the

00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:31,100
deal here

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,770
so it depends like if he's a event in

00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:37,040
Nuremberg we will probably care more

00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:40,550
about the ones that really need instead

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:44,780
off to want that okay let's bring more

00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:49,040
people so would change this the name the

00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:53,360
target about it okay um what else you

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:56,570
can say cost us about well about the

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,250
bestest oh yeah it's pretty important my

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,860
opinion is that it's pretty important

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,660
for the people to know that anyone can

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:08,720
apply but they have to be really serious

00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:11,740
in what they will do anything when when

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,530
someone is getting sponsored for invent

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:17,450
it has to he's not actually getting paid

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:22,640
to be there it's nothing like that he

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:26,450
doesn't have to work but it's important

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,940
to be there so his face because with the

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:31,220
travel support program sponsors sponsor

00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:33,800
people to go to events to make opensuse

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,250
more visible so once you once you go

00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,800
there you are you you're the only thing

00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:42,320
that the driver support program asks for

00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,470
you is to become an evangelist and try

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,320
to attract people for the project if you

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:50,840
don't do that and you just sit in a

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,790
booth or in your room hiking travel

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,080
support group travel support program

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,360
it's not for you don't get me wrong

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,150
hackers are needed and if it's a

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,030
technical convention or something like

00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:05,780
that yes you should do that but when you

00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:11,390
are around the booth you should act like

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:15,110
an evangelist otherwise you know suisei

00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:19,610
gave opensuse that money to start that

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:22,370
program because they wanted to see more

00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:25,550
people around not because they say one

00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,590
day okay let's help some guys that we

00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:31,060
know when the general Randall travel

00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:34,340
free it's not it's very important to

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:38,060
understand that you're not obligated in

00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:40,519
doing certain things it's not like open

00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:43,820
suse it's your employer but you

00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:47,299
to act you have to be grateful because

00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:51,139
it's a help and if you get some other

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:53,539
one and it's more important to have more

00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:56,209
money to give to people to go to other

00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:58,159
conferences instead of giving I don't

00:24:56,209 --> 00:25:01,609
know half of the budget for someone

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,789
travel for example to China and being

00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:06,529
saina and just have a nice trip not

00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:09,229
doing anything not helping the local

00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:11,209
team because also one of the main

00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:14,169
reasons that travel support was created

00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:18,169
was sent people doesn't opensuse people

00:25:14,169 --> 00:25:22,039
to other cities countries whatever in

00:25:18,169 --> 00:25:24,349
order to help the local teams which we

00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,079
spend a lot of money we spend that we

00:25:24,349 --> 00:25:31,399
send a lot of people to countries to

00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:34,669
help local teams grow know and this is

00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:36,440
one thing if you have the people that

00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:40,599
have more social skills when they are

00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,070
going to events like folding or whatever

00:25:40,599 --> 00:25:44,779
we prefer to send more of the people

00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:46,909
that have social skills instead of

00:25:44,779 --> 00:25:49,729
hackers to force them because and

00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:51,709
another thing is that hackers will go to

00:25:49,729 --> 00:25:56,899
fold them anyway yeah who's gonna need

00:25:51,709 --> 00:25:59,450
to help yeah ah just doing something um

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:02,509
it's important to keep in mind is

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:04,779
something really um I don't know the

00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:10,029
word to say but something really

00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:12,889
dedicated might be this P is not a price

00:26:10,029 --> 00:26:15,169
and we had like four summit a huge

00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:17,599
discussion about it before some it like

00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:21,440
okay but we need to approve these

00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:23,629
requests why oh because they helped us

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,279
in there that conference they helped us

00:26:23,629 --> 00:26:30,969
in stuff has to help us making what's

00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:35,149
the name release party but that's not

00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:41,200
just about that if you are volunteer we

00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:45,109
believe you are not expecting to be paid

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:50,210
to go there that's that's the point so

00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:53,509
of course we want to attending events to

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,260
help us to spread to know the difference

00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,660
between

00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:00,260
futures that's not because okay I did

00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:02,720
something now I can fly away I can have

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,060
fun because I did read something that's

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,710
not the point so please keep in mind

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:12,110
that if you were sponsored once is

00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,930
because you are important it's not

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:18,650
because you are getting the sponsorship

00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:20,030
as a prize okay because for us it's

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,270
important that you know different

00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:27,590
cultures different countries different

00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:30,830
point of view to be helping the project

00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:35,300
so for us if you are were there or if

00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:37,940
you go to other place bring their miamor

00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:41,300
carry the luggage with your experience

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:44,120
okay don't think that okay I was a

00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:46,760
sponsor because I observe it yes you'd

00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,360
ever but you are sponsored because we

00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:53,870
want to around we want your experiences

00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:59,570
we want your backgrounds to make the

00:27:53,870 --> 00:28:01,700
community grows okay yeah I had a small

00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:04,400
question when you talk about the quartet

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:08,840
and so you said you have an amount for a

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:12,800
quartet if you ain't money left in the

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,950
quartet can you give this money to buy

00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:18,470
for example marketing stuff or can you

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:22,580
take the money to use it in the next

00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:24,950
quartet or is it closed no uh no now we

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,790
have we are no difference path now

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:31,220
because before all the money was inside

00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:34,520
suzy deal in the different way like okay

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:38,800
this be marketing open source ly team

00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:42,590
and so on now all the money is under

00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,530
open source board management so then

00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:49,280
they tell us okay guys you have like

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:54,920
five thousand to use this on quarter

00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:59,330
okay they waited like I didn't use my

00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:03,380
money less squadron the money that I i

00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:07,460
would mention i cannot use for the next

00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,000
quarter me as tsp if the board decide to

00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,580
mean

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,610
in negotiate in a different way it's up

00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,350
to the board not up to TS fitting you're

00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,950
not another another very important thing

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:21,710
is that but but the the bar do you say

00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:26,270
this kind of things about budget so they

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:28,640
they have everything open it means if

00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:31,880
you have events values interesting

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:36,350
events from LA to June and not from

00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:39,710
January tomorrow I lost that's that if I

00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:43,190
if I don't do I manage to hell if i

00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:47,300
don't have requests like now we have

00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:51,770
linux tag happening now in me okay so

00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:55,210
how we deal with linux tag we as tsp

00:29:51,770 --> 00:30:00,080
save some money left to assure that we

00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:02,660
won't live linux tag uncover it this is

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,000
what we fought for but it never happened

00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:08,780
because some cooperate polish accent but

00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,940
now like ass tsp we have we can manage

00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:16,160
the money the best way we can so inside

00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,140
our team I'm the one responsible to

00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,540
meant the way to use the money that's

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:22,940
why I saved some to assure linux back

00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:25,690
cover because it's an important event

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,540
another very important thing is that

00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,780
when the travel support program asks for

00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:35,480
their seats to be given in two weeks

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:38,780
okay we have some you now you is not we

00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:42,140
okay the growl support program has some

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:46,370
time if you are late for a week okay

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:49,130
it's malleable but if you are late for I

00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:53,120
don't know a month or something it's not

00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:56,210
travel support that won't give you the

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,580
money it's that Susur know it's in this

00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:02,180
case is the travel support I want to

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:04,460
work in your chambers man yeah but but

00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,290
originally those because we had

00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,090
something no because we made a deal

00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:11,990
between Europe and Susie and Susie yes

00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:15,230
otherwise I would be working imber sment

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:17,720
the whole year believe me I had a case

00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:20,659
that a guy tried to get him busted 11

00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,659
months after 11

00:31:20,659 --> 00:31:25,909
and the only thing that he had was a

00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:28,249
credit card bill like hey but i was

00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:31,099
there i know i saw you there but i'm

00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:34,070
sorry it's just again for impossible

00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:37,099
yeah yeah that was funny at the time so

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:42,019
the thing is in two weeks we have time

00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:45,080
to rearrange the budget left if happened

00:31:42,019 --> 00:31:51,320
to no no to have another conference like

00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:55,879
now we had budget without any use just

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:59,059
with thirty percent of usage before but

00:31:55,879 --> 00:32:02,570
like now we are completely then with

00:31:59,059 --> 00:32:05,059
them the actual budget including the

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:08,419
conference budget but we know that linux

00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:12,710
tag is important so some money is there

00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:17,859
just what sure but how can i do that

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:21,529
because people meant to put linux tag

00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:25,820
into open source list of events

00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:27,649
otherwise I couldn't see that far so

00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,940
that's why it's important to always put

00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:31,669
to the conference that you know that

00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,090
might happen or if you are not sure just

00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:37,159
copied it the past year's events put

00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:40,700
their last foot events and then okay I

00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:44,419
have an idea another thing very

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:46,720
important don't overspend you've been

00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:50,330
sacked if you want to catch the first

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,059
class in an airplane we had the

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:58,639
situation too yeah and there was funny

00:32:53,059 --> 00:33:01,669
cos this supposed speaker was invited to

00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:04,729
be a keynote speaker and then we said

00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:08,379
well welcome please look for trip and

00:33:04,729 --> 00:33:13,700
then send us how much you to spend okay

00:33:08,379 --> 00:33:17,330
3000 flight okay we're all flying from

00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:23,370
I'm from here to here um that's too much

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:27,420
well I'm too tall he is on my side

00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:29,640
I'm just also my legs come on you know

00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:33,720
give him a break and then was pretty

00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:36,540
easy because I said we we approved the

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,680
amount the riu amount like how much it

00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:43,590
cost the guy who was haha complaining

00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:46,080
but then I talked to the organizer at

00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:49,020
the time was brian and brian said no way

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,550
even me with this tall wouldn't fly

00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:55,559
first class so we talk between us we

00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,050
talk between the conference organizers

00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,190
summit organizes the team we talk

00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:07,140
between us and be sure we you try always

00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:09,480
to save open suse community money more

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:14,310
important to us to have more pencils

00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:17,850
people were around then why didn't speak

00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:21,270
here or whatever we come first as opens

00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:25,560
with people okay one last thing taxis is

00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:28,080
not out of treason I don't care okay but

00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,030
I know if I need to talk remember

00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:34,290
remember that guy that told us it's part

00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:38,520
of the trip my taxes pass along welcome

00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:42,000
sir no let me explain why might be a

00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:47,399
strange like okay cab is not in Texas

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,520
naughty just 20 euros like okay my 20

00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:53,070
euros to go he is 20 years and he is 20

00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,520
years is six years and then to drive

00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:59,070
back home under 20 well might be

00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,630
sometimes one train ticket for someone

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:05,130
to go to the conference and go back home

00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:08,610
that's why okay we don't cover visa as

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:11,490
well I'm sorry I need a visa someone

00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,830
else needs a visa is something that you

00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:16,110
need to invest we cannot cover

00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:19,080
everything for you and we don't cover

00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:23,280
food for one reason you eat at home

00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:25,560
right so you wait anywhere else of

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,020
course in someplace a bit more expensive

00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,330
with loves food but it's okay it's pizza

00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:37,140
it's the same along all over the world

00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:39,670
so what else we had like strange

00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,370
actually have another question but i'm

00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:46,930
not sure if you to finish less first no

00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:51,400
okay the first question is we have no

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:55,540
idea about how did you decide it if you

00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:57,700
have to applicants how do the study that

00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:00,340
I would support you or not so I try to

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:03,100
use an example to make my question more

00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:06,310
clear there are two guys they would

00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:10,570
attend the events different events in

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:13,780
the same quarter the first candidate one

00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:16,990
is they do some contribution to the

00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:20,280
opensuse community and they would do the

00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:24,400
presentation he meant a the other

00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:28,120
candidate B is he too much more

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,510
contribution than a in the daily life

00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,870
but he just told attend the events be

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:39,310
without any presentation how did you

00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:42,100
decided which was more important to

00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:45,640
support in this case that's why you have

00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:49,150
a team and the team look for the both

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,720
contributions and few have known or just

00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:55,750
quite few we talked of people that work

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,960
for this person inside the project to

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:01,120
know how it goes you know is like I if

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,150
the person's own where's he and used to

00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:06,520
talk with someone else we're gonna talk

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:10,240
to this person and see how is the

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:13,510
contribution because it's always besides

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:17,500
a huge conference like this everyone's

00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:21,970
around after the conference you don't

00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:24,370
see a sign of people around it's always

00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:29,410
like this but we know who are they you

00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:33,190
know like they are there now and we hope

00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:36,310
the issue but if I have just one amount

00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:40,320
of budget are we gonna try to share

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:44,710
because for us contributions are equally

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:48,970
important of course code is because of

00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:50,140
the cold we are here but cold without be

00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:52,930
spreading around

00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,539
there's no matter so four of us is

00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:57,880
equally important so would prefer to

00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:00,579
share the amount that you have we did

00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:05,019
that before instead of paid for just

00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:08,049
just one of course if the guy a is the

00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:12,039
second event that he's going the same

00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:15,430
quarter we'd go give the chance for the

00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:19,180
person B because this one a red was

00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:21,160
sponsored at same quarter so we're going

00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:24,369
to try to make imbalance otherwise it's

00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:27,809
not fair it doesn't make sense from my

00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:31,059
view okay the second question is I

00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:34,180
attended the opensuse conference in past

00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:38,170
few years sponsored by susie because i'm

00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:41,799
susie employee so is it possible in the

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:44,859
future i apply for to travel support as

00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:48,789
those whose employee well this is under

00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:54,579
discussion and for us first thing is

00:38:48,789 --> 00:38:57,430
important um if about the budget we are

00:38:54,579 --> 00:39:00,819
working about this subject the body's

00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:03,430
talking with susie to make a decision as

00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:07,630
a tsp I don't notice team but the other

00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:09,910
thing we we agreed that the Malfoy's

00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:12,069
employee or not you are opensuse

00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:14,619
contributor that's important for us so

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:19,809
these are responsive that's all you are

00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:22,210
opensuse anyway but some rules are Susie

00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:26,710
has mean they are dealing with that too

00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:29,589
to help us always we gonna try to tell

00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:33,150
you to talk to your management to see if

00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:36,819
you can have your management support

00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:39,970
because it's a matter of time about your

00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:43,059
time outside the company few you you

00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:46,150
need to take holidays or itself you know

00:39:43,059 --> 00:39:50,730
they job outside something like that so

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:54,700
it's more about you in your job first

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:57,940
sometimes you can manage like okay TSP

00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,579
cannot cover loop but we have a great

00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:03,420
board and we have a char mia that'sa

00:40:00,579 --> 00:40:08,130
Sue's employee that can help us

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:11,010
as open Suzy to talk with you know the

00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:16,190
other management to try to approve your

00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:21,170
trip so we have ways to do that okay so

00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:24,150
meanwhile when you it's not officially

00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:27,780
approved or not that's the way that you

00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:31,290
can make it we as open suse TSP can talk

00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:35,549
to to our char Mia side the board and he

00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:38,400
can talk to to you in your meal ninja to

00:40:35,549 --> 00:40:41,069
try to fix and help you but in the

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,799
conference remember for us you are not

00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:47,880
Sue's employee you are open suse member

00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:50,670
the thing is that we use at least what

00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:53,730
was in the beginning travels upward

00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,440
susan louise used to take travel support

00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,720
program the thing is that some of them

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,410
abused this program and that's why the

00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:04,890
managers told no Sue's employee would

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:07,319
take tsp I mean when we started the

00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:10,290
program yes assemblies were around and

00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:13,829
we gave money to do is when we start but

00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:17,040
the sad fact is that there are some

00:41:13,829 --> 00:41:19,829
people that think tricky and that's why

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,049
all this all this happened ETA and

00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:24,480
honestly we give a lot of fights mean

00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:26,579
Isabelle with this is a guy's so that we

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,569
can sponsor opens a guy Susur guys

00:41:26,579 --> 00:41:35,480
because I mean henna for example we were

00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:39,510
here yeah we want Anna everywhere but

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:42,480
when if his manager won't give him if

00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:45,119
you wouldn't give to him any chance we'd

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,170
like to help it was the case it's not

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:53,280
the case but if it was the case and

00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:56,940
because for us is in Ephesus or student

00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,799
or some company employee and we don't

00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,089
know about their life maybe the guy has

00:41:58,799 --> 00:42:05,190
a huge salary but he has three kids and

00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:07,619
expensive wife at home and he needs help

00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:11,339
that in the conference so the point is

00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:14,730
how can we help it but there's a

00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:17,280
conflict between the the ideas cuz maybe

00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:19,680
your manager believes that there

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,230
that's not the best conference for you

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,940
to attend maybe he thinks that I don't

00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:26,070
know you are you work in a different

00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,260
thing and it would be better for him to

00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:31,110
sponsor you to go to another kind of

00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,650
conference so mostly between you in your

00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:38,090
boss other other people from other

00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:41,250
companies they manage their holidays or

00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:45,080
occasions our days off to use it and

00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:48,360
that's the situation because somehow

00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:51,780
happen with some Sue's employees to me

00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:53,580
me you know to make stay do but I'm

00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,750
going to pursue the conference why any

00:42:53,580 --> 00:43:01,590
day off to go so that's why we lost the

00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:04,260
power to sponsor whoever we want but

00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:08,240
won't be a problem our board is

00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,240
supporting us oh that's right

00:43:11,069 --> 00:43:14,869
please any question

00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:25,200
ok

00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,200
so

00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:36,299
Marcel yeah so guys we are here in any

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:39,349
case whatever you need any doubts for

00:43:36,299 --> 00:43:44,279
the future and about the application

00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:49,309
uncle be here you can poke in and of

00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:53,730
course it's a tool that is always with

00:43:49,309 --> 00:43:57,119
with improvement now so the two is

00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,309
pretty much like it's not easy it's not

00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,319
just about the two would be much easier

00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:03,269
for us to deal with a tool that you can

00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:05,789
just go and press a button and

00:44:03,269 --> 00:44:08,759
everything's done but a matter of money

00:44:05,789 --> 00:44:10,680
we need to be careful that's why it's so

00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:13,680
complicated to deal with the tool

00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,440
because if you do not pay attention how

00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,059
to make a request how much has to do it

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:22,680
about the exchange and everything else

00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:27,359
you probably won't take care about the

00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:32,069
situation to be it's possible there's a

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:35,190
picture picture at three right yeah so

00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:38,190
you guys should come out and get a group

00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:41,000
sorry there's a good picture so other

00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:41,000
