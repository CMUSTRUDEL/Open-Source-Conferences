this took more time than so hello I'm

00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:13,710
cautious quedaras I'm a community member

00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,949
I mean no pense a board member but this

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:21,060
is not how I will talk here so forget

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:24,420
that actually I wanted to make two

00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:27,080
presentations but they were small both

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:33,149
of them so I decided to make one on my

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:35,550
way so so the thing is let's make

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:37,410
something clear when i joined the

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,370
opensuse community I hated Susa guys

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,860
right no offense I hate everything has

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,379
to do with corporate and I did that

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,379
because I I had the wrong idea as it

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:51,870
turned out to be so I'm just saying that

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,039
because I will defend those guys today

00:00:51,870 --> 00:01:01,489
at some point so you have to know that

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:05,010
now where it's not us and them each week

00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:09,090
let's talk about rumors inside the open

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:14,720
source free software projects people

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:19,470
think that projects that have corporate

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,119
behind them they think those projects as

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:23,520
a needle projects because they think

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,960
that they are just a bunch of kids that

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,420
a bunch of monitors tell them what to do

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,090
as I told you before this goes a bit my

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,000
opinion but I liked opensuse because it

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,909
is it wasn't it is a great distribution

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,780
and it is a great project that you can

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,899
do a lot of things with so yeah spent

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:51,750
two or three years using open suse and

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:53,369
hating Susa guys so at the salient point

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,560
I start interacting with those guys and

00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,350
they turned out that they were great

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,869
guys but even then I was like I don't

00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:08,520
think if I have a problem I can go to

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:12,690
those guys and help me and this is where

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,660
rumors go many of the people around the

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,450
project and

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,780
of the people that didn't come to the

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:22,270
open source project do that because they

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,380
thought that first this corporate thing

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:29,530
and second that the guys that work from

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:34,030
sue says and contribute to ensue sevits

00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:37,240
is very important I are just the guys

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,980
that try to control the community it

00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,620
turned out that this was a big myth

00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:47,110
which goes in asking do more and nasty

00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:51,610
rumor and it's actually the opposite hey

00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:57,250
those guys unethically are trying to

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:59,680
help and they if you you're around do

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,540
you have a lot of Susa guys around go

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,080
talk to them and you'll see that they're

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:07,110
actually nice guys yeah that's that's

00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:14,130
what I thought of Susa guys back there

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:19,930
so this is the one part yeah good right

00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:23,050
so this is our one this is the first

00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:29,260
part of my presentation the thing is

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:32,770
that a we as a community should approach

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:34,959
and we should start approaching more of

00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:41,070
those guys I know those guys because

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:45,160
those guys asked us to do that because

00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:48,820
they want to work with us they really do

00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:52,209
and whenever they go out there in the

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,890
mailing list and ask for our help most

00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:58,510
of the guys don't answer because they

00:03:53,890 --> 00:04:04,239
have the idea i mentioned before so it's

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:09,310
not like cool doesn't need anyone to

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,440
help him with factory or he does that

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:16,390
because he's along with another five or

00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,280
six guys and he's on his own if you go

00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,190
to him and say i want to do that for

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:23,930
factory or for the release there's no

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:28,070
way to tell you that you cannot do that

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,930
case in in some restrictions right there

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:31,970
are some restrictions but if you want to

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:37,940
help there are no restrictions in

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:40,570
helping those guys so the truth is that

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:43,759
these guys are part of the community

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:47,690
they want and accept help and they

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,990
really won't he'll trust me this is the

00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:54,410
feedback we got the past two years or

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:59,750
three years that we are closer to those

00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:02,870
guys and also another great thing that

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:07,310
needs to be mentioned is that those guys

00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:11,120
are guiding people I mean I had AIDS a

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,400
guiding me AJ me a firefighter from

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,310
Greece who was just fooling around with

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,570
his computer meaning that we also had

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,910
those when he was our community mother I

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:26,650
mean if you want to contribute and you

00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:30,289
don't know how and you think that some

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:33,740
someone that has something to do with a

00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:38,389
project in a more professional form than

00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:41,590
you go ahead and ask him he will not he

00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:46,849
or she we have a lot of girls lately so

00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:50,330
they won't deny you help so that was the

00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:53,690
first part of my presentation the other

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:58,070
thing I want to do is represent to the

00:05:53,690 --> 00:06:02,720
community some of the tools that we as a

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:07,580
community use have a note and don't use

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:11,060
efficiently this is a personal selection

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:13,070
of tools that I like it has nothing to

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,250
it's not all the tools that we have as a

00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,349
community and some of those are not on

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,710
the opposition infrastructures it does

00:06:18,349 --> 00:06:25,900
tues that rookies or even more

00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:28,880
experienced people can use to contribute

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,909
and get information either contribute

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,680
either get information from the project

00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:39,250
so first of all there's geek hub

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,460
so if you think that you cannot make

00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:45,610
changes in the opensuse project this

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:48,400
proves you wrong there's github you can

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,550
download code make whatever you want

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,110
without I'm not familiar with github I

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,440
like the way it works but I'm not fully

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:59,289
understand how it works and only go get

00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,090
full get booze and then you have not

00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:06,280
even sure how that word so now there is

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,009
of course the oven build system that

00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:12,460
used to be opensuse build system which

00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:15,039
is another great tool for me the tool

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,199
that makes opensuse more than a

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,320
distribution the main tool that makes up

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:23,699
and susan more than a distribution those

00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:28,120
guys do a hell of a work they help the

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:31,150
open build service is a tool that has a

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,430
lot to do with opensuse but has also a

00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,800
lot to do with other project

00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:38,830
distributions you name it whatever you

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,139
want to build park at his own it's there

00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:45,849
it even build packages for windows right

00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:48,010
yeah I think it also is XL I got this so

00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:50,139
if you want to be part of the open

00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:54,430
source project but don't want to install

00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:56,500
open suse linux or of answers in general

00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,419
or even if you don't want to have free

00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:04,419
software in your computer you can still

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:06,849
use that tool and work with it then

00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:11,440
there's bugzilla which is a great tool

00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:14,740
if you want to help and you can help

00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,009
either by submitting bugs that you have

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,020
on your computer either if you want to

00:08:18,009 --> 00:08:22,960
solve some bugs you're a developer or

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:27,220
something in you want to solve some you

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,159
can go there see see what see what

00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:35,709
happens so am i stressed and my knees

00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:40,779
are not that good so then we have the

00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:43,539
wiki the witch so for the past four

00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:46,180
three or four years in opensuse

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:48,760
conferences except this year we always

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:49,520
have someone saying gasps let's make a

00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,010
team

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:58,670
and make the wiki look nice it started

00:08:55,010 --> 00:09:02,720
Zords tried twice I know other people

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:06,020
that try it for five or six years week

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,540
it won't be nice you won't be able to

00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:13,510
find everything that it's been written

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:17,210
on the wiki get over it or help people

00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:20,690
to make wiki a better place the fact is

00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:23,480
that opensuse wiki has tons of things

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:28,550
and tons of things that you could take

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:31,990
and use it from making a for setting up

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:35,260
a booth to coding I don't know what

00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:37,940
making open good service or whatever

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:45,980
which is a great tool but it's a messy

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:48,980
too you know so go there make the

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,170
changes you like many of the things that

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,640
aren't there that are their needs

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,280
updating so if you want to do something

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,930
just go there and start updating things

00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,880
this is a start if you want to

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:05,840
contribute in some way in the project

00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:09,530
and it's really ridiculous to to use I

00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:20,240
mean it's not even HTML something very

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:25,180
simple structure to ask it that so

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:28,910
there's a open faith open faith is

00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:33,080
practically not that alive to anymore

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:35,870
but i like it and i think when when i

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,050
first saw up on fade early i honestly

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:41,390
thought that it could make community go

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:45,170
even further because you could you can

00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:49,010
go there find projects vote if you want

00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:52,010
this inside the project or not open

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:57,080
discussions flame wars because

00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:59,620
everything included and then there's a

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,420
new tool that it's also great

00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:05,320
tool and unfortunately I cannot

00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:09,990
understand that to that well although I

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:14,410
have to use it often it's progress

00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:18,910
progress it it says it's a knob and

00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,890
social project management tool I'm not

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:26,980
sure I actually understand that honestly

00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:29,290
but what I understand is that when you

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:34,089
can go there and see what's going what's

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:38,589
new on the project and you can interact

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:42,870
I think with other people it's not like

00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,870
Facebook or something that's coming

00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:51,160
we're sorry but okay progress oh then

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,050
there is active dog documentation

00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,850
documentation accommodation this is a

00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:59,710
structure form of the wiki you can

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:03,360
actually use that to learn something on

00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:09,070
wiki you will spend more time searching

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,830
done learning but at some point I think

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:16,540
guys that are making these we're asking

00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:18,339
for help so if you like to write you can

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,130
find I think you again you can find you

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:26,080
again and I know him I'm helping if you

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:29,290
like what else Oh last but not least

00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:33,100
it's worked out this is last because

00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:36,790
it's not an opensuse infrastructure tool

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,450
is a tool that we use to make

00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,880
translations it's probably not the best

00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:48,670
to we could use but it's a tool that

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:53,620
actually works and it's it's pretty easy

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:58,570
to go there and interact and localize

00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:01,060
the opensuse projects as you see for

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,150
some reason German Italian Spanish

00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,160
Portuguese are not that high and I

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:08,230
cannot understand that because most of

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,779
the users I know you are German Spanish

00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,300
and Portuguese so

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:22,189
oh we Greeks are fourth and sex our

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:25,939

00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:29,420

00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:46,850

00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:52,879

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:30,259
me on my presentation so proudest

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,930
databases of art it's actually a project

00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:37,370
management tool okay the lot of people

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:39,860
here will be familiar with read mine so

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:44,899
it's just a read mine instance we used

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:48,889
to coordinate the job of several teams

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:51,379
for example we use it a lot in the open

00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:55,939
sue setting up to say for working for

00:14:51,379 --> 00:14:58,279
coordinating the job dong him in open QA

00:14:55,939 --> 00:15:02,300
and other tools it's also they told that

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:04,629
the admin team used to so when you write

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:07,490
a male to admin @ opensuse the org

00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:10,040
asking for something because you want to

00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:14,569
include your blogging planet because

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,550
something looks broken in any one tool

00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:20,779
or another in OBS or rinse off or

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:22,730
however it creates an issue there so you

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:25,210
can go there and see if somebody is

00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:28,550
really paying attention to what you

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:30,800
need and then you will see there that

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,630
they change the state and we're working

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,420
on it is already fix whatever and you

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,780
come with your comments they are so

00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:41,630
everything that is ongoing in the admin

00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,460
team or in the opensuse team or in the

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,220
war is documented they are and you can

00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:50,210
see what are we doing daily I'm asked

00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:53,090
for anything unit thank you and I just

00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:57,400
remember i have two more slides as i

00:15:53,090 --> 00:16:00,080
told you 20 minutes to me well now I

00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:04,520
presented you the tools the thing is

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:08,780
that when we go to conferences and see

00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:12,170
guys showing us tools and we say okay oh

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:15,890
nice tool I would love to play with it

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:19,610
at some point the thing is that most of

00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:23,330
us don't do that and it's wrong try

00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:26,270
keeping notes guys we we came here and

00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:29,270
we saw a hell of great presentations so

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:31,910
far about people who have done amazing

00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:37,640
work in various aspects of the project

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:39,560
of free software generally so try to

00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:45,440
hold notes keep your excitement going

00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:48,140
and go out there spread the world you

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,700
know the thing you don't have to be an

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:56,990
ambassador anymore so you should go

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:59,630
there use your tools take advantage of

00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:04,270
all that good work that has been done

00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:07,760
the past years in Europe and Souza and

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:10,040
spread the world and of course make

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,900
things happen right because we're we're

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,970
all good at talking I'm better than you

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,260
but you know but it's not only talking

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:21,949
it's acting and acting it's very

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:24,740
important and if we guys want to build a

00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:26,630
strong project because we like what we

00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,730
see and we like what we're leaving

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:32,570
because this is leaving the open source

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:36,980
project the conference's is leaving

00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:37,550
given to the project is would be nice to

00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,820
have

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:43,060
all going on and on and it won't go

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,770
anywhere if we just come to conferences

00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,580
sleep in our tears see some

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:58,370
presentations drink beers it's great but

00:17:48,580 --> 00:18:06,040
we have to do more now I'm over yeah

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:06,040
