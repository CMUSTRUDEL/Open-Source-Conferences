hello Froemming - my name is Dmytro

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,179
sourpuss and i'm here to present you how

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,450
to promote open sourcing universities

00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:15,320
and technological Institute's

00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:18,270
if you wonder what is a technological

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,250
institute it's the kind of university we

00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,260
have in Greece which is more focused on

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,689
the technical aspects of every science

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:32,399
there is not a big difference but we can

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:35,370
call it a college anyway when I started

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,629
planning for this presentation there I

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,180
tried to and I thought a lot about it

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:45,329
how do I pass all these years

00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,750
five six years I'm on that team I've

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,160
been lucky to be on the team and how we

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:56,039
promoted Linux in our College in a

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,590
presentation it's really really hard to

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,520
do that because there are so many things

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,520
I could talk about for hours

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,340
so tried to do something easy and didn't

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,470
want to tire you you will mostly see

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,340
pictures on my presentation nothing else

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,130
and if you have any questions while I'm

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,750
speaking feel free to ask because I

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,979
might have forgotten something

00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:26,820
so how did it all began first of all if

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,340
you want to promote open source you must

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,650
like open source and if you don't want

00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,490
to be alone you need to find some people

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,610
that got the same interest interest like

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,299
you this is how our team began we had

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,490
three people that were all into Linux

00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:50,850
and they decided to make a look at him

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:54,210
our Linux team didn't begin a very large

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,210
in the beginning there were just three

00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,869
people trying to find others so they

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,409
could do a better job and the first

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:09,810
thing you want to do it since install

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:14,270
first and especially to the newer ones

00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:17,490
to the newer students to the freshmen

00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:19,950
this is how it all began this is one of

00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:22,620
the first install fest that happened yes

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:26,880
you see it happened in one of our

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:30,510
university labs people were not that

00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:32,820
many and it was to be expected you in

00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:35,190
the beginning when he make that kind of

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,550
a thing you don't have many attention to

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:40,860
you you many people don't even know

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,650
about Linux or open source and you have

00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,310
to convince them to try that alternative

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:52,650
so our first install first we talked

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:54,510
about what is Linux why it's better what

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,990
are what are the advantages what other

00:02:54,510 --> 00:03:01,440
disadvantages may be and of course we

00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:04,170
saw them how installation is made how

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,520
easy it is to install Linux on your PC

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:13,680
and if people are interested they we

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:17,780
could install them bundu bug them to

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,210
their laptops it went quite well

00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:23,580
sometimes might work may you have many

00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,280
people you might not have many people to

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:28,410
come but for us it worked well on the

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:33,210
first one and as you can see in the

00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:35,280
second one which we even had our own our

00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:38,100
own room to make the presentation a

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,880
bigger one made for that many people

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:49,350
came and this is how it started to our

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:51,570
team started to grow a you need a good

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,810
planning when you want to make that kind

00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,780
of a team you need to plan its install

00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:00,060
fest every action and there might be

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,410
some paperwork that have to be done if

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,700
you want to do that in your college

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:09,720
because our teams like a look but only

00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:13,530
for our little college so if we wanted

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:16,410
to have the support of our professors we

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:20,060
had to do some kind of paperwork so to

00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:22,470
be recognized as an official team and

00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,360
maybe have the support

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,650
it wasn't easy in the beginning

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,780
especially because we have some

00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:32,650
professors that were not really dressed

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:37,990
in DINO persons they were Microsoft fun

00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:42,030
boys if I may say that but if you work

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:45,370
hard and if you really love what you do

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:49,690
you might make them change your mind the

00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:54,280
very mind this is another presentation

00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:56,530
we did we tried to do to install for

00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,360
spell here and many other smaller

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:04,510
workshops or presentations each semester

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:06,400
this is another presentation one of the

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,740
early years of the team I wasn't even

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,840
remembered back then because I wasn't in

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:17,560
the college I wasn't student it's time

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,440
we tried to strive and grow and become

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,720
bigger and make more people interested

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,000
and have more people to our team because

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:29,199
the bad thing with that kind of things

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,449
is that there is an end for its member

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,660
you know you go four years to your

00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:38,139
university then you graduate you live so

00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:41,800
there is a struggle it's here to find

00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:45,070
new blood that's what we try to do we

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,680
struggle it's here to impress people so

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,810
we could have more new members that

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,300
could continue our legacy this is

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,729
another picture what you have to do if

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,460
you really like open source anyway you

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:03,780
you will do it either way like we do

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:07,150
right now is to have a continuous

00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,000
presence at many different conferences

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:14,260
not only in our country but maybe

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,539
outside we multi did attend many

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:21,490
conferences in Greece this is a picture

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:23,220
from poskim Boscombe is the annual open

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,610
source

00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:29,820
users and developers meeting in greece

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,440
people go there we have presentations

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:36,010
it's like a Greek open SUSE conference

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:38,969
but for all linux distros and everyone

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,969
interested in open source

00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:45,590
since as I said before we tried to do

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,790
bigger and better things so that we

00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,360
could grow and because we were

00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,890
passionate and worse the larva of course

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:57,490
that was the first force combat took

00:06:51,890 --> 00:07:02,090
place in Greece in Athens the next year

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:05,750
we organized the second fall school we

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:10,970
took we took first calm they gave us the

00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,920
conference and we did we did FORSCOM we

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,990
organized it and it was really

00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,420
successful if you saw the pictures

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:23,750
before the first members we had were

00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:27,920
like 6 7 now there are more live with

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:31,580
more than 15 members of our team because

00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,180
we kept moving forward and gathering new

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,300
people this is what you have to do to

00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:40,220
try and make bigger and better things

00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:45,140
nothing will be easy in the beginning it

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,460
wasn't easy for instance back then it

00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,880
was the first time we had our own room

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,790
so that we could gather when we began

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,790
our team we had to go to different cafes

00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:59,110
it's time we had a meeting which it was

00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:04,700
not the best atmosphere for us to

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:06,260
communicate to vote etc we didn't even

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,690
have our own server

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,460
this thing's Camille ater don't expect

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,390
that everything will work right from the

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,280
beginning for you

00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,680
we didn't even having our own server

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,990
which they kindly gave us later

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:23,060
so that we could have our own node our

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:25,280
webpage our own IRC channel etc and

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:29,600
mailing list main link list actually

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:34,370
this is sing so that we could help more

00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:37,490
people the team grew and continued

00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:40,490
growing now we because of FORSCOM and

00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,830
because we try to do a very professional

00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,750
job at that

00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:46,580
finally our professor starting seeing

00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:49,460
that we were not just the team of kids

00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,500
that they were doing their thing is and

00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,320
their hobby and there weren't serious at

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,920
all

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,259
they gave us a room at least a small

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,860
room this is the picture that shows how

00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:04,279
the room was in the beginning most of

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:09,269
the pieces you see there are pretty old

00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:15,990
20 or 50 years old we even have some Sun

00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:20,220
sparks from 1990 1990 which are active

00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:25,680
to this day and this is how we decorate

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:29,699
the room in the end and it made our life

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,769
release because yeah this is actually

00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:35,100
the picture taken from an open SUSE

00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:36,930
release party we did because we are

00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,430
distraught glowstick and this is the

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:40,889
best thing you can do to be this

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,930
fantastic if you want to make that kind

00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:46,110
of team you might see some familiar

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,300
faces I can say board member here and

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:52,490
some sushi ambassadors here and there

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:56,190
and the sushi plate back there anyways

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:59,399
so we had our own room which you might

00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:01,889
haven't really get for yourself too and

00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,649
that made things easier because people

00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:07,889
could come to us in the beginning people

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:09,750
were coming and that was our mistake for

00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:12,690
picking up bundu people who were coming

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,490
once a semester and we're asking us we

00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:19,440
have graded our system and something

00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:22,260
broke how can you help this and we

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,660
couldn't get many members that way then

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,699
we switched openSUSE and by having our

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,430
room it was really really easier for us

00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:31,199
for and for people to come there because

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:34,440
it was a warmer environment from a

00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:36,870
cafeteria or something else so people

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,389
were coming were asking questions we

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:43,380
were helping them install their D so

00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:45,660
that is of their choice they could come

00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:48,959
with the ideas for projects they might

00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:51,959
have and we could help them collaborate

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,730
with them and that really helped our

00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:59,939
team grow and not really helped our team

00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:02,730
grow in numbers but the bond between our

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:04,800
members very stronger because we had fun

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:08,010
time like friends there

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,050
like fellow hackers whatever you might

00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:17,070
want to call it

00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:20,340
developing and having fun now we tried

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:23,340
all these years to stay active and to

00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:26,730
spread our team and spread what our team

00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:29,160
does and our love for open-source these

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,010
are for example pictures of many

00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:35,430
different events this one is from an

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:42,330
event in Athens organized by another

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:44,400
University there we attempt it we we had

00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,490
some talks of our owns we did some

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,120
presentations and help like as we call

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,220
it by then we're not we were not an

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,120
unknown team in Greece actually we were

00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:00,870
one of our bigger and maybe more active

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,420
and well-known things in Greece and I'm

00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:06,000
really proud for saying that everyone

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:08,360
knew our name and what we were doing as

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,770
a team because we have a holiday

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:15,840
organized a very interesting FORSCOM the

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,570
other pictures one from our software

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,390
freedom day as you can see there we even

00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:24,000
have our own penguin mascot we got a guy

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:28,320
who dressed like a penguin and the other

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,690
one is from another open-source event we

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:40,640
did in in our College it was a two-day

00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:44,540
event from Hearts cold the free software

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:48,660
company as might say that in Greece so

00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,040
this is very this is very important if

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,530
you want to make it in like that you

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:58,640
have to stay active you have to focus on

00:12:52,530 --> 00:13:02,430
doing bigger and better things and not

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:04,260
stay in what you did in the past because

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:09,420
there is a future there are is a

00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:11,760
continuation into what you do this is

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,350
one of another install fest the number

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,050
of install fest by the years gradually

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,690
lowered

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:21,940
two per year its new semester because we

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:25,170
had new students coming freshmen coming

00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:28,480
actually it's semester we had only

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,670
people coming a freshman coming came the

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,019
first semester

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,480
changes in the Greek educational system

00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:36,820
I didn't wanna bother with that but

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,329
people continued coming and we continue

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,250
doing our best we continue presenting I

00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:43,740
had a bit longer here back then when we

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,959
tried our stall fest

00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:50,350
we would we try to make some better

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:52,899
presentations take note of what we did

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,420
in the past what things we should fix

00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:58,630
and this is what you have to do how to

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:02,290
make open source more appealing to

00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:04,959
people because when someone comes and

00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,260
he's from window from the windows world

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,750
he doesn't know why should i why should

00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:12,880
a stone lineage why is it good for me

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:15,579
and why should I stay with Windows

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,440
because you know most of our lessons in

00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:20,230
our university in our Co let not

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,680
university are in Windows so I don't

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:27,839
need them I don't really need them and

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:35,020
we tried we did some very good marketing

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:38,260
that this is another pic of picture of

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,000
our install office I had to put this pic

00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,459
in because George had to move the

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,839
presentation so I had so his face but

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:47,890
then everything changed when the Fire

00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,050
Nation attacked

00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:53,760
and what I mean by the fire ignition the

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,470
Fire Nation is Microsoft Microsoft

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,230
actually one of our professors brought

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,300
an academic Microsoft academic program

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:06,570
or what it's called neural correlates

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:09,220
and this made things harder for us but

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,930
was that actually good thing for us

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:14,079
yeah I think actually it was a good

00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:16,209
thing because now we had competition and

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,690
not only did we had competition we had

00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:22,540
very hard competition we had Microsoft

00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:25,029
we had people that were coming from

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:30,819
Microsoft preaching the so called marks

00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:33,609
of evangelists we had a the Microsoft

00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:36,639
actually do many contests with it's like

00:15:33,609 --> 00:15:39,339
write an application for our market get

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:41,879
a mobile phone we don't have that kind

00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,899
of budget we can make our own contests

00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:45,459
Microsoft can come and tell you you know

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,759
if you're very good and him to write

00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:50,829
many applications and maybe come to our

00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:55,689
Microsoft guru team then you might have

00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:58,720
a job with us we can't promise that to

00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:00,910
people and many thought that you know

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,919
open-source doesn't give you any money

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:08,589
in the future doesn't help you at all so

00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:11,949
we tried to do bigger and better stuff

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:16,509
and promote tell them actually the truth

00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:19,119
in the best way we could and this is

00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:20,889
just an example of an event we ever were

00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:24,970
so pretty the bottom droid

00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:29,439
you shall not kind of people yeah with

00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:31,600
that Microsoft people still were

00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,199
interested in Android because back then

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,350
Android was the new hot stuff so we may

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,409
now present a workshop about that how to

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,979
write applications in android then

00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:47,139
actually the individual side as you can

00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:52,569
see not only in the presentation but

00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:54,429
after and we still continue doing

00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:57,159
workshops like you can see we had a

00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:59,619
given Jing workshop if they want picture

00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:02,619
and the other was some mother kind of

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:06,100
presentation I think that might have

00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:09,699
been another install fest or joint talk

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:15,189
with the other teams doesn't really

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:18,220
matter and let's let's talk about the

00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:22,329
speak a bit later so now we had another

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:25,179
team in our College what do we do of

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:30,429
course we lost members potentially new

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:31,149
members we try to gain some and it

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:36,789
worked

00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:40,480
where we're in a good situation I think

00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:43,090
right now since we still struggling and

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,170
try to do stuff see we try to join

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:47,320
conferences

00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,630
and to whatever best we can but now the

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,600
competition is or not only are Windows

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:56,320
limits are the BlackBerry team its

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:58,780
Unreal Engine team its web team I don't

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,330
know there are some black around six or

00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,470
seven different teams which is a good

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:08,730
thing because it all started from us and

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:13,300
I think we should be proud for that too

00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:17,950
so what did we do if you want to make a

00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:21,070
team first of all find some people but

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,770
like open source then try to make an

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,840
event it might not be bigger in the

00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:28,630
beginning you might have only ten people

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,360
and from these ten people only one or

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:34,210
two mate may - may be interested in

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,210
Hynix but don't give up try to do it

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:41,880
again try to make some workshops try to

00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:45,460
educate people try to show them why

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,400
Linux is good for instance we had a lamp

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:50,160
workshop people didn't know what is lamp

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,440
and why it is important

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,400
teach them indicate them try to pick

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,800
their interest try to do bigger and

00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:05,260
better stuff start promoting what you do

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:08,410
start socializing more with people make

00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,870
a mailing list make an IRC channel make

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:16,510
a Facebook group or a Facebook page or

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:18,280
whatever try and continue trying try to

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:22,810
make fake things this is the most

00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:33,090
important lesson that I have got - for

00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:36,280
you what else now yeah parting yeah part

00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:40,330
your team you have to party after you

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:43,840
work hard for instance go for a drink

00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:47,110
socialize people tend to think that

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,300
Linux Linux guys are geeks that have no

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,670
social skills and they don't never

00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:55,470
socialize they stay in their basement

00:19:51,670 --> 00:20:05,980
and only code or to see stuff

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:09,250
be social what else try harder try to

00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,470
make projects for your college to help

00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,990
them so then that open-sourcing po is

00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:19,200
important right now and this is what i

00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:23,200
forgot to have the online registration

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:26,620
system for our labs is an open source

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,890
project run by our team and maintained

00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:32,230
by our team mostly and this is something

00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:36,400
that works for all of our college all

00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:39,190
different courses and this is a big

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,560
class because we sold them that you know

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,530
what we did something that was really

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,380
really needed with open source and it

00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:50,830
works and helps you really much and you

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:52,540
can do many stuff so them that you know

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,900
you can do many stuff with open source

00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:58,480
maybe get a job will you like and the

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,880
most importantly you learn things you

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,890
learn many different things for me if it

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,410
wasn't for that they might be that guy

00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:10,480
that would Steve stop playing the guitar

00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:12,610
and doing stuff on the internet if it

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,520
weren't for these guys I wouldn't have

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:18,580
even one-fourth of the knowledge I have

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:22,150
now and because they motivated me and

00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:29,860
they made me learn my stuff and wanted

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:32,320
to learn more and this is one of our

00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:34,600
latest picks it's not for years now it

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,190
has been around six years and we still

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,510
continue and we hope we will continue

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:44,500
until our college closes or I don't know

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:46,950
the Holden's maybe so do you have any

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,950
questions

00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,679
my question is you talked about

00:21:59,429 --> 00:22:05,679
introduce the installation to the guys

00:22:02,679 --> 00:22:08,830
from the beginning and I would like to

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,149
know you just tell people how to

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,970
installation

00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:16,539
oh you offer the chance to the people

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:19,090
really do in installation on that he

00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:22,450
went because I would like to know how do

00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,999
you resolve the laptop problem because

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,489
at the beginning people may hesitate to

00:22:24,999 --> 00:22:30,850
install Linux on Windows other

00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:33,369
distribution thank you yeah I know this

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:36,330
kind of problem we really had many

00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:39,669
people that were very hesitant but

all this time

00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:30,309
we actually had someone which was really

00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,470
crying because installation was not

00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:35,019
going really well it was actually stuck

00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:38,859
because her hard drive had some bad

00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:43,389
sectors then we found out in the install

00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:45,850
first time but ok it worked in the end

00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:49,179
it worked you know you have to tell them

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,950
that you see it's like five clicks you

00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:54,460
don't have to do anything else and

00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,249
nothing will go wrong you can even try

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,869
them on a virtual machine if you like

00:23:56,249 --> 00:24:02,169
right now you they can always try own

00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:04,840
original machine it's very easy it just

00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:07,559
takes some time to convince them

00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,559
some they want to try they might even

00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:14,080
