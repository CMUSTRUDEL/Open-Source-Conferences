Title: osc14: Vincent Untz,  Packagers: make your life easier with magic tools
Publication date: 2014-04-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	One of the main area of contributions to openSUSE is the packages, and we have a great amount of amazing packagers. Still, working on the packages can be a painful task when it becomes repetitive. Good news! It turns out that there are tools to help you for this, and for some reason, they're not as used as they should be, which means that some of us are still suffering more pain than they need to.

Come to this session to learn about some of these tools (osc collab! obs services!) or to share your tips with others.
