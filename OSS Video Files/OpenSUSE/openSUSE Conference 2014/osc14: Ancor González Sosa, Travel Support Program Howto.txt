Title: osc14: Ancor Gonz√°lez Sosa, Travel Support Program Howto
Publication date: 2014-04-28
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	The openSUSE Travel Support program aims to support contributors representing openSUSE at events, conferences and hack-fests by reimbursing up to 80% of their travel and accommodation costs. Requests and reimbursements are managed through a specific web application available at https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support.

In this talk, the main developer of the tool will explain how you can use your existing Connect account to submit new events, to ask for travel support for a given event and to get your money reimbursed once your travel is over. It will also be the perfect chance to discuss about the improvements needed in the tool and the process after one year of activity and more than 30 reimbursements processed.
