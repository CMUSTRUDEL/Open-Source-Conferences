Title: osc14: Ancor GonzÃ¡lez Sosa, Travel Support Program Howto
Publication date: 2014-04-28
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	The openSUSE Travel Support program aims to support contributors representing openSUSE at events, conferences and hack-fests by reimbursing up to 80% of their travel and accommodation costs. Requests and reimbursements are managed through a specific web application available at https://connect.opensuse.org/travel-support.

In this talk, the main developer of the tool will explain how you can use your existing Connect account to submit new events, to ask for travel support for a given event and to get your money reimbursed once your travel is over. It will also be the perfect chance to discuss about the improvements needed in the tool and the process after one year of activity and more than 30 reimbursements processed.

so first things first welcome and my

00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:14,759
name is Hank or I work in the opensuse

00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:17,400
tomatsu said I'm the main color behind

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,390
the tool we use for supporting the

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:25,010
travel shuttle program it's not exactly

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,019
a totally tailored application for our

00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,630
super cyber problem with quite a generic

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,910
one but i will explain here just the

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:37,140
process needed for applying into the

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:40,770
opensuse traveler program it's probably

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,559
also important to say who I'm not I'm

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:46,829
not part of the travel soup or a

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:50,570
committee so that the means that I have

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:53,129
no real decision power of about what the

00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,640
program does with the money who get a

00:00:53,129 --> 00:01:01,410
sponsor who it not or even how they plot

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,170
the whole process works this is is the

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,150
guy right in the code okay but since i'm

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,640
the guy working the coal I know quite

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:12,570
well how their full process work so I

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,570
guess I can explain it so first I will

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,780
very briefly introduce you the travel

00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,360
super program itself because there was

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,580
already a session before from the

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,970
committee themselves explaining it so I

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,770
guess it's not really needed and then we

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,759
will concentrate on the process itself

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:35,520
that either because you were attending

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,860
that session and you decided that you

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,200
want to take venture of the program or

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,570
either because you already applied for

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,130
this event and do you want to know what

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,880
do you have to do to get your

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:51,720
reimbursement down but I will explain

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:55,290
the whole process so as the committee

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,719
already explained some minutes ago this

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,930
is a program for supporting people that

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:04,590
wants to travel to attend to events to

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,600
conference to help to promote opensuse

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,989
or to do something that is valuable for

00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,879
the project the it works in a

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,319
reimbursement model that means that you

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,329
really have to spend

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,109
the money from your pocket and then you

00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:22,409
will get it reimbursed hopefully in a

00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:24,780
short period of time and it can

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:28,739
reimburse you up to a eighty percent of

00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:33,269
all your travel & lodi and accommodation

00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:37,980
cuts so the whole process that's all I'm

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:39,329
going to explain about the criterion the

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,530
basis you already had the previous

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:46,349
session okay there are some criteria

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,519
that is then let's what that the

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:53,370
committee will look it's already acid is

00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:57,709
planning work a lot already publishing

00:02:53,370 --> 00:03:00,180
on the opensuse wiki they will pay for

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:02,699
everything that is really related to the

00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,439
two traveling like playing train

00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:07,019
whatever and for the accommodation but

00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:11,040
as they said not for food or not for

00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:13,799
sindelar completely accessory so you

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,919
send that request the committee will

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:21,680
study your case and other requests and

00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:28,979
they will decide how much money will you

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:32,759
be reimbursed in case you except they

00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:35,879
will check if is this too much if they

00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:38,040
decided to give you only half but not 80

00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:40,680
but only half because they already they

00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,349
also have to share the budget with other

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,879
with other people applying whatever so

00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:50,909
they need your explicit acceptance that

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,349
also means your compromise of doing what

00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:56,099
you are supposed to do if you are

00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:58,379
getting sponsored and that's up to you

00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,669
again just go there and do what you're

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,979
supposed to do and behave properly and

00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:07,319
all these kind of things remember that

00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:10,769
you are being sponsored by the project

00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,459
so make the project be proud of you

00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:17,579
somehow and after the event you will

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:24,060
study reimbursement process itself that

00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:27,630
means that you will you will provide the

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,909
receipts with okay I finally I was

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,050
planning to spend this this and this in

00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:36,150
this and that way but I finally did

00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:39,870
maybe can be a little bit more maybe can

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:42,000
be a little bit less and you have to

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:43,710
really attach the receipts for

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,539
everything on the invoices for

00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,779
everything that you are claiming that

00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:53,219
you span no invoices no reimbursement

00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:56,130
and you should do some public reporting

00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:59,370
because this will say okay to the war

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:04,560
okay I was there this does is what I did

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:07,440
so the the project knows that the money

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,779
is being invested in something worthy

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,889
and of course the for payment the

00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:16,469
accounting department well you need some

00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:22,710
bug information that's because it they

00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:24,659
will pay by by a bank transfer so then

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,360
once again the committee checks that

00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:30,210
everything is ok if not they will ask

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,710
you for more information for correcting

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:37,740
whatever is needed and then it will go

00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,419
finally to once the committee's head

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,969
that everything is okay you will go to

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:47,520
the content department and you will get

00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:50,699
reimbursed be patient sometimes things

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,979
are not as fast but everybody will like

00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:58,380
and also fit bodies very welcome if you

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:00,120
really receive the money it will be kind

00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,130
if you notify through the application

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,779
you can do it you don't have to write a

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,210
meadow whatever you can even go to

00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:11,400
applications okay I got the money it's

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:13,770
okay that's that's finished a can be

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,680
done also by the Susa accountant

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:20,909
department but it would be nice if you

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:27,419
take this one minute to go there and

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:29,820
report so all this process takes placing

00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:33,000
in one application you have the URL

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:37,560
there this connected open slot or

00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,300
travel support and the first page you

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,640
will see is the user guide the user

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,470
guide of the tool is the front page and

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:48,600
obviously this is on purpose so if you

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:50,670
are going to be a sponsor please take

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,330
your time to read it is not that long

00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:56,070
and if you already did for example

00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,520
because you applied to this for this

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:02,190
event and you visit debate now you will

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,650
see that the explanation for the ring

00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:08,340
plasmon process have a slightly changed

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:10,680
that's one of the great outcomes for 4

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:14,210
from this come from these conference

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,580
that the committee decided to offer a

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:23,460
simpler reimbursement process with is

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:26,490
shorter I'm hopefully more clear or in

00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:29,460
general you will find some interface

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:32,640
changes it's also on one of the outcome

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:36,120
of this conference because everybody

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:38,430
that should check approve the interface

00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:43,020
did it so we already have a new version

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,900
online so just go there I'm for a really

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,720
accessing and creating your request you

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,300
need a on opensuse username that most

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,100
likely you already we'll have if you are

00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,720
a contributor and then you should fill

00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,030
up all the information in your profile

00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:03,120
you can find it your profile by clicking

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,850
on the top on the corner in this in your

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,470
username next to the logout button

00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:10,110
there's also another link exactly the

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,850
same place in the menu so it will be

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:16,410
quite easy to find one way or another

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:18,600
and since you are an open to say

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,150
community member you are supposed to

00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,330
have a profile and updated profiling

00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:26,580
connect that opens to the arc so the

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:28,770
tool will read more Sigma Mason from

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,390
there there's something that you will

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,880
need to write on the tool itself because

00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:35,280
their information that is needed for

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,039
payment and is traveling and these kind

00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,900
of things that are never asking connect

00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,880
because this not relevant for connect

00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,979
but most of the information will be read

00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,000
for from there so make sure that you

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,840
connect profile is up to date

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,330
if it is and it should be you will have

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:56,710
most of the work or religion already

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:58,720
done so before at the same process but

00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,880
now looking at the tool is before the

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,970
event QA the request they are on the

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,670
tool then the requests need to go

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,100
through several several states it's like

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:11,320
you can't even consider it like a game

00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,100
so you tried you're trying to reach the

00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:17,590
final state okay some state some

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,720
transitions will depend on you you

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:24,550
really have to go there I'm for example

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:27,430
submit it to the to the committee or to

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,020
accept what the committee does some step

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,450
will not depend on you for example the

00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:35,470
committee approving or rejecting your

00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,930
request do what you are supposed to do

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:40,240
at the event and after living going into

00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:43,150
the tool create a reimbursement and the

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,030
same process takes place again with a

00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,940
slightly different workflow of states

00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:51,010
but once again you have to push your

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:56,680
reimbursement to the final state that

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:58,450
hopefully will be paid so how do you

00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,880
apply how do you create create this

00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:03,370
request you simply have to go to the

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,500
event list which is in the application

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,470
look for day when you want to attend

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,900
click on it and you will have a quite

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,860
prominent green button there for apply

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:17,620
and this will create any request a blank

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:20,440
one that you will find in your menu you

00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,510
have a requests option in the menu that

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,950
so the request is created and goes there

00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:29,980
in case you miss it somehow and if you

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,110
even is not there you can also create an

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:34,060
event from scratch because you want to

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:37,410
apply to an event that is not in the

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,150
plan already set up where they committed

00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:44,800
perfectly having a cockface installation

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:46,690
parties wherever release parties so if

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,910
you create anything please double check

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,260
that is not already there just go

00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,459
through the list read carefully and

00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,130
provide as much information as possible

00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:59,050
because if it's nothing ladies is

00:10:57,130 --> 00:11:01,839
probably because the committee is not

00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:03,310
aware of it so don't put just the name

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,890
is playing what it is and what is

00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:08,110
important for opensuse okay so once the

00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,760
event is created or so you simply find

00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,630
the event there just click on the apply

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:16,450
button and you will create a request and

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:19,810
then this game of trying to reach the

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,209
final state begins there is a diagram

00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:25,060
here that is of course also in the user

00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:28,089
guide so in the front page it may look a

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,950
little bit scary but believe me is quite

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:34,240
simple all you have to do in fact is

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,550
provide all the information that the

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,160
committee will require from you and then

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:44,410
submit it okay this the first transition

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:49,060
goes on your side so you submit it on if

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:51,100
everything is okay the best case it will

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,709
be approved by the committee and then

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,950
you only have to accept it again so it's

00:11:53,709 --> 00:11:59,230
solid two axioms up beside of course

00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,300
writing everything that the committee

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,360
needs to know but is wholly submitted

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:07,930
and then accept it when it have been

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,490
approved of course maybe you submit

00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,589
something that is not perfect so they

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,970
roll it back to ask you for more

00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,990
information and you have to submit a

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:20,050
gang and this game can go song over and

00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:27,029
over but hopefully you will be able to

00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:31,240
fix it another important seem is that

00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:33,550
the state is not only relevant for the

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,329
warfield itself or within the last step

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:39,910
but also mean depending on the state in

00:12:37,329 --> 00:12:44,140
which your request is you will be or not

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,970
able to edit it so when you create what

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,850
is in in computer stay with is the first

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:51,339
one you can edit everything you can

00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:53,770
write anything you need and you it's the

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,110
most important part release the expenses

00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:58,959
you will add as many expenses that you

00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:01,540
will need okay you have all more and

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:06,130
more so when playing another playing the

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:09,640
holder whatever it's important that you

00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:12,460
remind that simply hitting the Save

00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,960
button will not send it to the

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,570
committee so you have to write

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:20,020
everything safe look that looks okay and

00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:23,050
after you have carefully take a look on

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,490
it didn't submit it okay so yes saving

00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,880
does not mean that you are submitting

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,430
for any always that you want to change

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,990
the state in this diagram you have the

00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,480
axiom button you click on the action

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,150
button that you have your choices that

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,720
is submitting or rolling back or

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:42,130
accepting or cancer canceling if you

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,080
simply are not able to reach an

00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,760
agreement or whatever list everything

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,070
you want to change the state just go to

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,240
the axiom button and choose the proper

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:54,640
axiom for the rest will have not affect

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,040
so while it's on in completed stage you

00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:00,120
can change anything you can add expenses

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,760
or anything you need for every expense

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:07,840
you will be asked for the estimated

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,360
amount maybe when you are requesting the

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,940
support you already know how much money

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,560
are you going to spend then it's

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,200
perfectly fine you just in this

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:20,110
estimated account amount you put that

00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,690
number but sometimes you will have to

00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,360
estimate to guess because it depends if

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:28,570
if you have this idea that you will only

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,680
go if you get support and you and

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:35,050
there's two weeks or is too far away the

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:37,930
events or the prices especially with

00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:42,430
planes can go or the hotel or whatever

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:45,280
so keep in mind that first the committee

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,770
will check that the estimation is fair

00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,300
that you are not asking for too much

00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,280
money for something that can be done

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:56,140
with less money and then you will all be

00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:59,020
granted up to eighty percent of this

00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:01,330
estimation so if you already know

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:06,700
perfect if not do your best do some

00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:08,710
research and in anything remaining when

00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,200
there is a change in the stage always

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:13,330
have a history section there in which

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,760
you can also add comments so you will

00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:17,620
see all the stations of all the comments

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,420
or in order to remember what was

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:25,390
happening with your request and you can

00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,339
edit well its own incomplete one is

00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,620
submitted you can

00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:31,529
modify anything else and then it's the

00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,199
turn of the committee to write the

00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:36,509
numbers you want to know what is there

00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,579
proof among so you have the estimated

00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:40,290
amount on the proof among okay and

00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:42,389
that's the maximum you will get no

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,550
matter how much you spend you will never

00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:47,370
get more than the team that they are

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:49,379
proved among so then you okay it so it's

00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:51,600
okay for me I accepted it's not okay I

00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:54,360
prefer to cancel out the rollback or

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,449
whatever so only in completed stage you

00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,999
will be able to edit only in submitted

00:15:57,449 --> 00:16:03,389
state the committee will be able to ask

00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:05,610
me to to edit and once it had been

00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:12,600
accepted you cannot change anything

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:15,629
that's that's the deal okay so as I say

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:18,899
they can react for some or roll back

00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:21,720
with which sounds nicely they can roll

00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:23,759
back your request again to the

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,249
incomplete so you can edit it again and

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,509
submit it again or they can just approve

00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:32,279
it so you accepted that its own if for

00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:34,379
some reason you change your mind and you

00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:36,059
want to change something you have to go

00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:38,850
back to link completed state to do it

00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:41,279
this is the only place in which you can

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:42,980
change things submit is it the other way

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,399
where the committee can change things

00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,870
otherwise is just accepting reacting

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,809
because it's a deal and it's important

00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:54,839
that the terms of the deal are not

00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:58,170
moving when people is discussing it or

00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:00,929
taking decisions and once again the

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,939
remember that you no matter how much you

00:17:00,929 --> 00:17:07,559
spend you will never get more than the

00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:12,110
approved amount ok so after the event

00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:16,289
you want your money back and the

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:18,929
workflow is pretty much the same it used

00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:21,419
to be more complicated in previous

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,260
versions but the committee decided to

00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:27,809
make it more issue so good news for you

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,630
so it will go also for incomplete to

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:34,049
submit it and do it directly to approve

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:37,700
so once the committee seems that your

00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:40,020
report is ok it will go directly to the

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:43,770
account and a permanent Susie

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:46,710
so those two last state that are just

00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,980
going forward it's once everything has

00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,260
reached the administrative power so the

00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,900
paint process mean today payments on

00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,030
going you only have to wait and paid

00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:00,570
well it's quite a boost that you already

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:04,530
receive the money so once you get your

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:07,470
mission is to reach the approved state

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:10,250
then since will simply go on further

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,750
it's just as miniature administer

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:18,060
administrative staff so you know in

00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:20,340
which studies but its ongoing how you do

00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,380
it okay you go to your request that you

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,520
already have should be already accepted

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,140
for sure if you if it's not accepted you

00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,660
will have no reimbursement but probably

00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:32,850
you will have no trouble so just go to

00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,500
request that is already accepted and you

00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:37,680
have asked for reimbursement button

00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,610
there will be also quite obvious and it

00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:44,660
will create a an empty arrangement and

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:48,870
yes you have to write everything they're

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,120
pretty obese but so in the description

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,150
you should explain what you did they are

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,870
and why you seen that you achieve your

00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:00,630
goals of course there is also a bank

00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,970
information you will have to write your

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:06,720
bank information is this in their

00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,940
environment and in your profile to avoid

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,650
security concerns so it's not something

00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,000
that it's always you go to the profile

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,340
of this guidance they are the

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,410
information is only used for the rain

00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:18,240
apartment so it's only asked in this

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,210
point you don't have to fill up your

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,890
bank information to request to 20 years

00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,620
in just when you are asking for

00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:28,080
reimbursement and you should provide

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,490
links because if you are supposed to do

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:35,850
freeport probably a blog post a link to

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:38,310
your social networks or whatever you did

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:42,270
to promote the event and your presence

00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:44,540
they are and the opensuse you can add as

00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:47,930
many links to the report of you want and

00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:52,500
you can also ask add as many attachments

00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:53,880
everyone for any for example for a

00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,710
printed article or

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,870
any other thing and with this mod

00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,450
important for the receipts for the

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:03,360
invoices knowing voices no reimbursement

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:06,810
so you will have to attach all of them

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:10,200
there in a way that are pretty well

00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:16,050
visible that much what is sprinting in

00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:18,600
the expenses part and as Isabel said the

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:21,000
movements in this received from there

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,820
from your credit card is not an invoice

00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,580
you ain't really voices and then you

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,340
will route in the total column the

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:33,120
amount that you really spend that is on

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,520
the invoices so you will be reimbursed

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,520
the minimum between what you really

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:41,430
spend out what you were approved to

00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,260
normal if you spend a lot you only get

00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:46,470
the amount the approve amount if you

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:49,590
spent less than expected you will all

00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,750
you will only get what you spent oh if

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,490
you save money thank you you're saving

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,150
money for the project but you will not

00:20:53,490 --> 00:21:00,840
get the difference ok because it's

00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:03,060
reimbursement no payment once and the

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,630
only difference between this process and

00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:10,260
the request one is that since the

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:13,860
reimbursement includes payment I mean

00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:17,550
somebody from Susie really doing it bank

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:21,000
transfer your explicit signature is

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:24,660
needed so before submitting the

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,270
application will ask you to print form

00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,610
when exactly the same information that

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:32,820
you can check so you write everything

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,730
you save you looked at everything looks

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:38,160
fine the numbers are respected numbers

00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:41,820
you are getting the minimum between what

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:44,760
you are what did you spin spin and while

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,890
you were approved ok so then you click

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,190
on it and just means you click on it you

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:54,030
print it and you sign it with a bang and

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:57,750
you attach it ok so it's it's a legal

00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:59,850
requirement so it's you simply have to

00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,860
do it you have this download printable

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:04,470
version you will have to look on it it

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:07,080
looks sayings maybe it is also quite

00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:07,870
useful to discover things that are maybe

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,630
not so

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,450
you looking at the ad application should

00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,240
be but could be some hidden detail and

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:19,230
in the paper it will be even more

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,300
obvious and since you have to sign it

00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,860
put a line on it so if you find

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,890
something that you like just close the

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,570
PDF edit the information again open the

00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:31,990
PDF again when you are happy print the

00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:35,200
PDF sign it and use the attack a touch

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:38,080
bottom and that's all that's all you

00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,870
need then the the warfare will take

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,440
place and you will hopefully reach the

00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:48,970
payment they paid state for all the

00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,670
periods in which the the reimbursement

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,640
process is open when you going can you

00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,200
apply what is probably what are the

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,730
criteria all this information was

00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,790
already mentioned in the previous

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:03,880
session and I don't see that it's any

00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,500
point in repeating it so simply remember

00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,140
that the territory prime is always

00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,350
hoping they have a special calls for

00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,360
events like this but you can always go

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:18,130
there create the event and ask for

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:21,520
support for a sponsorship so use your

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,350
opensuse connect account and simply use

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,420
it you're supposed to have one who have

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:30,010
you're supposed to have one up to that

00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:32,650
one so just take advantage of it I will

00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:35,350
not repeat the four steps because I said

00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,170
I think that are pretty clear now and

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:43,809
please remember that the committee it's

00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:46,720
a committee of volunteers so be kind and

00:23:43,809 --> 00:23:49,570
be patient if you don't get a reply the

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,570
same day okay most likely they will be

00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:55,030
doing another thing or taking decisions

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,700
of boating or waiting for more people to

00:23:55,030 --> 00:24:00,370
apply to the same event in order to

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,820
decide if you are getting nervous for

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:05,290
some reason use the add comment button

00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,929
why the comment there they will get

00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:11,380
notification about it the same for the

00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:14,290
payment if if remember mine is in

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,300
process statement that is beam is

00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:18,700
already in the content Department it

00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:21,820
will be paid don't get nervous but if

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,190
you do you can always use the

00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:27,700
common bottom but please be kind this

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:30,040
volunteer basis work so and that's all

00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:33,220
just go there and apply if you need it

00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:35,400
so you have some questions the right

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,400
time

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:09,659
my question is after events people don't

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:12,179
need to send the receive due to certain

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:14,669
address just upload the skin of the

00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:16,679
recipients ok yeah yeah it's the you

00:25:14,669 --> 00:25:19,140
have a button to attach them yeah it's

00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:21,450
the receiver just you have to scan them

00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,820
somehow if you have been already need a

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,340
format like for example planes usually

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,980
send you the the invoicing already in

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,690
digital form but if it's just in paper

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:35,370
you have to scan it and attach this

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:37,789
there's no alstyle emailing involved ok

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,789
thank you

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,120
well the facts is not a question they're

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,640
always just I want used to want to any

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,410
real question no it's not a lot i was

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,250
wondering now as I wondering if I could

00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:05,890
just try to help you to improve the

00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:08,290
interface a little bit so if you can

00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,480
please go back in your presentation I

00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:13,390
can just point what I what I want to

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:17,050
mean a little bit more more more more

00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:21,520
more more more MORE the first first one

00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:23,860
I think that that's one that one so the

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,250
first thing I mean it is easy things

00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:30,150
that can help us to to get a pleasant

00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,340
experience with the two the first is I

00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:35,230
only yesterday I realize that that

00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:39,070
little phrase in the end over there

00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:41,770
you're correct profile is a link to the

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:45,250
profile so this could be easier see that

00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:48,910
was painted repairing in red in green in

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,310
ledge yeah green and maybe maybe an icon

00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:54,520
I did hear you can delete it from here

00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:57,400
so maybe I get a little trouble because

00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,190
in the very first moment what you want

00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,210
to try to do is edit here right but the

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:06,970
fields are not available and what how

00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:09,010
did so you get a little bit so well

00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,260
that's it's just I guess you skip the

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:14,710
user guide that was the first page

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:17,770
probably and I can even bet with you

00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:20,740
that maybe hundred percent skip it that

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:22,690
is the point right I mean that's why I'm

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,310
not joking and saying that just means of

00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:29,290
that in another color could help people

00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:33,580
so if you go ahead a little bit no link

00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:37,350
attack right use it yeah so a little bit

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:40,750
more more furthermore I that data yes so

00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:44,230
suddenly my mouse just pass through that

00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:48,190
little arrow there you see the blue

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:50,920
arrow yeah this is fixed the oh so this

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:55,810
is not like that and we now don't owe as

00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:58,930
I said we are developing the tool always

00:27:55,810 --> 00:28:02,830
but before deploying it on the products

00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:05,140
cyber the several eyes that had to put

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,150
the look on it so before going live with

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,010
a new version we need some approval from

00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:12,820
the committee from the TSP super B's or

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:15,910
whatever so we we're just two weeks ago

00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,400
we were a lot of persons behind we had

00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:22,930
zero dot seven in the production server

00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:25,120
and we were in 0 dot 96 in real so now

00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:27,340
that's other of the as a side order of

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,860
the outcome of this conference everybody

00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,520
had the time to sit down to local it is

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:36,040
now proven a lot of improvement in their

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,440
face we were aware of but yeah i know

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:41,440
its application that mean that manage

00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:43,030
money so you have time to hate the

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,730
production servers with the changes but

00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:47,560
it's fixed right now so now how you do

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,930
with that i click in the indie title and

00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,880
this is kinda listen yeah in there when

00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:54,580
it says requested and does amaze you

00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:59,260
click on the arrow or in the i mean very

00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:01,930
title I say great so this was I was are

00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:05,650
you supposed to tell you that so well in

00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:08,590
the last idea well this is in the last

00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:13,000
vitamin I mean it's not important to see

00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:16,750
the slide is that when you explained it

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:20,520
it it makes all sense that you save but

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:23,680
you're not submitting it right so maybe

00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:26,590
make this blow on the face when people

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:29,110
say save are you aware I I know

00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:31,720
something with Ajax very big with

00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,970
something you know turning around and

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,830
blinking and you know and sending you 10

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,840
emails per day you save it but you are

00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:40,480
not submitting it yeah but because say

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,660
yeah I don't know and and just just to

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,460
say first if my first reaction was this

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,630
doesn't make sense but it does I

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:54,370
understood it so congratulations and the

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:57,040
last idea is okay sure email used to be

00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:01,120
fine wait to get in touch with people

00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:04,570
but not always in a knot in every single

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,900
way so maybe considering tweet people or

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:10,840
the diaspora or send I know find on

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,890
other ways to get in touch sometimes it

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,980
happens with

00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:17,530
my server put your the message in a spam

00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:20,290
box and I have to call his other side

00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:22,210
well they forgot me this is no no no no

00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:25,270
no this is a hat something happens so

00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,460
just for consider yeah but it's usually

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:30,670
the case to use the email because like

00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:32,320
the minimum common denominator so you

00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,320
can have twitter you have come whatever

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,180
bye in general you always have well you

00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,180
need a male Direction email address to

00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:43,660
google register so it's usually we send

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:47,800
all the opensuse systems use this email

00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:50,650
for for notification so in general if

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:53,320
you have an open suse account that

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,840
you're using several services usually

00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,030
it's not saying that you did something

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,620
wrong but you should take it out but I'm

00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,190
here to make you marry in trouble from

00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:04,870
here I give up work opensuse ha dork is

00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:08,890
never goes today and yes you are right

00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:10,660
baby is not obvious enough but it said

00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,990
incomplete under modification there is a

00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,120
quotation from a shin mark there is not

00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:19,120
submitted you put it on so there is play

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,270
under subtraction just below so yes

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:25,300
could be more prominent but once again

00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:27,490
if you are asking for support and you

00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,730
have incomplete other modification not

00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:33,100
submitted a exclamation sign there you

00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:36,910
put the mouse owners so say pop up and

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:40,740
he's the instruction just below I agree

00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,740
with you every improvement is needed but

00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:48,250
just to give you my work I don't know

00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:52,110
that thanks ah ok you could make either

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:55,570
sometimes but it seemed pretty simple

00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:59,050
it's it's important data since you are

00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:02,800
asking for money if we're not able to

00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:06,910
read the rules or the guide why would we

00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:10,300
be concerned to sponsor you I'm sorry

00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:12,280
but that's the truth so I know many

00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,750
people that had a lot of trouble like

00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:19,690
hey you guys want to him burst me hey Oh

00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:21,730
like happen here the board poking me

00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:25,660
like hey you forgot to these guys said

00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:31,630
no he didn't submit Oh what can you do

00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:35,230
me it's his request not mine so read the

00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:38,650
the the guide that's why we we could

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:44,170
make easy yes but we need to call for

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:46,740
attention as well okay should say

00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:52,180
congratulation for the two only that

00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:53,830
thanks I don't want to I also have

00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,170
another scene to say about the tool

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,930
isn't good happen so contributions are

00:32:56,170 --> 00:33:00,880
welcomed we even have an open google

00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:05,680
summer of code pro yet for improving it

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:08,860
and if you four examples you find out is

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:11,110
this information is not enough to make

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,180
clear that you have to submit and you

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:15,490
have a better idea just go to github

00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,220
create a pull request and we will merge

00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:21,880
it if you means it's an open source

00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:24,430
project it's a generic tool now that we

00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:26,890
are not focusing on the subject anymore

00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:29,980
i can do a little bit of marketing about

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:32,170
the tool is a generic tool is not really

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:34,090
bound to connect if you change second

00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,860
favor a configuration file a will get

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:38,890
the information for every to any service

00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:40,540
you want it's not bound to hapa sushi

00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:43,780
accounts if you change another

00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:48,220
configuration value it will work with

00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:50,680
users in in the database the brain

00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:54,100
Boltzmann's and request workflows are

00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:56,620
not fixed the well the committee decided

00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,110
to offer a new one yesterday i miss

00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,660
already deployed so it's quite flexible

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:05,860
and it's on github and is free software

00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:08,290
yes commit your improvement we will be

00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:15,280
really happy to to be as much a

00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:17,830
contributions if i remember converted

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,130
there are too many things too after

00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:24,520
event why is some me to reimbursement

00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:28,179
report the other is read a report about

00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:33,520
the feeling of events read my question

00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:37,660
is which one go first if the other

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,160
question is so do the people expected to

00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,870
send the

00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:46,150
report of events to somewhere or just

00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:49,660
posted on the public website I ask this

00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:53,200
question because I were sponsored back

00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:55,720
known to attend Quebec one year and it

00:34:53,200 --> 00:35:00,460
is mandatory that you mentioned the link

00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:06,100
of the report on the Avenue Sam meet the

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:14,110
reimbursement sure he saw wants to

00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:17,110
answer since I'm genome foundation

00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:21,550
member and sponsored by genome before of

00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:25,450
course when we start the rules was jaws

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:28,120
aje and me at the time and then causes

00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:31,660
the many other people helped the main

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,480
rule was okay you need to advertise that

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:38,010
you are being sponsored by open sutra

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:43,290
support problem then some management

00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:46,420
changed Susie and they asked us to erase

00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:50,200
because the person thought would be

00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:54,490
embarrassed to say that you were were

00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:58,360
sponsored like for me in Nam like here

00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:01,990
I'm really proud to be sponsored by

00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:06,640
susie to be here you know like for me

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:09,840
it's great I'm really proud so I cannot

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:14,380
see problem with that neither you gone

00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:19,150
but that's why we raised a true so it's

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:23,320
no longer yes so the thing is most of

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:25,270
our people they do anyway they say they

00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:28,870
write in their blogs like hey I'm

00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:32,410
sponsored by opensuse travel sports

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:38,530
program so it's something that you can

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:41,350
work on we we don't care much if you

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:45,070
said or not but I think it's the best

00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:47,590
way for us to say for our sponsor main

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:51,100
sponsor that you are glad that they are

00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:52,510
thinking about us so if you if you make

00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,230
some mentioning to

00:36:52,510 --> 00:37:00,760
or blogs or whatever is really

00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:04,420
appreciated when people does we look for

00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:07,510
and of course we fall Beth to show that

00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:11,200
hey we are glad we can prove it like

00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:15,630
this so it's not a rule but few things

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:20,680
we might get back like was before and

00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:25,900
like I said Music Genome many ideas came

00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:29,020
from the known as well so and replying

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:31,210
to the question from a tool or work for

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,760
point of view the idea is that you felt

00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:36,370
powerless your public article whatever

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,330
whenever you publish it and then when

00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:42,970
you are writing the rainbirds mang

00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:46,150
report that you sent to the to the to

00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:49,240
the committee you link to it on it

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:52,840
because here is in this in this form you

00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:58,090
will write your report your feelings

00:37:52,840 --> 00:38:00,520
your bill your bank account and any link

00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:02,710
you want to provide about since that you

00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,540
have already published and the

00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:08,410
attachment is goes everything in one

00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:11,320
single step I cannot see very clear but

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:15,490
I would like to know if it is mandatory

00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:18,850
that we measure you please add the link

00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:21,220
of the report no it's it's up to you i

00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:23,770
mean to you on the committee criteria

00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:28,860
that they told doesn't enforce mostly

00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:32,380
nothing okay so you can you can submit a

00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:35,950
reimbursement with empty links even with

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:39,070
empty attachments with no invoices at

00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:40,510
all you can do it but then the committee

00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:42,340
will not approve it but it's not

00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:46,810
something that is enforced by the tool

00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:48,370
yeah you there is no place to clarify

00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,340
this kind of thing people will not

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:54,300
realized I should do awesome view are

00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:54,300
you okay

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,880
since it's not a rule about the the

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:15,210
report we don't have nothing at the

00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,720
application but if we change something

00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:22,620
of course the link will be mandatory or

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:28,440
reporter whatever okay but for now it's

00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:30,720
not and the time that was just to give

00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,000
an example okay that's my investment

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,090
forum with the receipts okay where's

00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,540
your report I did the right hi part so

00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,730
I'm sorry unless you do it now you won't

00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,030
get him burst because was the rule

00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:47,840
before but now let's see now we are more

00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:52,560
focusing on the umber sment tool and

00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:55,560
there's new things happening on the

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,400
project so we might change few rules for

00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:02,550
tsp not now but anytime soon the new

00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,680
team just arrived so they need some time

00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:07,530
to get to use it and to have more

00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:10,620
experience to make decisions for me was

00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:12,870
easy because i had jaws and AJ since the

00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,300
beginning I have I had people to talk

00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:17,220
exchange ideas but for then is quite

00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,890
complicated otherwise would be mostly

00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,890
under my vision and that's not the idea

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,980
so

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:38,770
nobody's complaining the two is perfect

00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:38,770
