Title: osc14: Christopher Hofmann, OpenFireMap - Burning Down Your House, NOT
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Not only the things you can see on a regular map, but also fire hydrants and other special interest information for fire departments and other emergency services are collected in the OpenStreetMap project. Since 2010 there is the project openfiremap.org that actually shows this data as an overlay to the well known openstreetmap.
The OBS project Application:Geo contains all the pieces of software that are needed to set up a computer for rendering map tiles. Besides presenting the OpenFireMap project itself I will show you a rough overview how to glue all pieces together to get a map as you can see on openfiremap.org.
