okay hi so we're going to talk about

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,960
design and about the branding work that

00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:10,019
we've done about the situation so let me

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,750
start off basically I've been at Susie

00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:15,269
again now for almost two years we came

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,890
into a situation where there was little

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:22,859
or no information damn available what's

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,029
that no I'm not going to take it so we

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:25,609
came into the situation where there's

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:30,330
little or no information available um

00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:32,309
basically you've got a logo that's quite

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,899
out of sync with the current Susie logo

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:35,670
so there's a Sousa brand and there's an

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,260
open Souza brand and they were both at

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,540
one time very strong and now over the

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,110
years they've kind of slowly spread

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,260
apart and the opensuse brand is very it

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,550
was very confusing for us to find

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:50,940
official elements or important elements

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,340
which we could easily include in a new

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,500
brand campaign so the idea what we

00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,420
needed to do as soon as possible was to

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,629
create a new campaign of branding

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,899
materials without any designer to

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,090
actually do it so we built a design team

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,439
part of it for opensuse part of most a

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,720
lot of it for Susie as well leave lots

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,299
of products that we work on but part of

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,780
it is for opensuse and we started off

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,549
with very little input I would say we've

00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,130
identified a lot of problems with the

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:23,340
brand as it is so we know long-term I

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,740
think where we want to go and what we'd

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,330
like to do is so says Donna our

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,570
wonderful new designer from the design

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,750
team has been working mainly on opensuse

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,009
until now she's done a bunch of this new

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:37,110
branding stuff that you've seen and

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,700
everybody's free to take whatever you

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:40,290
want so all the stuff there's also more

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,290
downstairs there's USB sticks and

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,720
stickers and posters and flyers and all

00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,759
the good fun stuff that you want and I

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,009
will warn you that if you don't pay

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,840
attention during this presentation I'm

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,909
going to throw things at you I've got

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,670
nice soft things to throw at you I've

00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,659
got wonderful things through it you look

00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,700
at that see that worked really well

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:01,290
sorry I didn't mean to hit you but yeah

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,110
so that's going to be your punishment so

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,219
yeah keep up so this is says Donna and

00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,110
she's going to talk about what she did

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,369
and at the end we'll go over some stuff

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,750
about how we're going to move into the

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,020
future and where we want to go a long

00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,020
term

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:19,230
hello my name is Rosella it's quite hard

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,290
to pronounce so yes I'm the guilty one

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:25,370
for some of the posters banners and some

00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:30,209
of this small stuff that you see around

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:33,900
as can said before when I started to

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:40,349
work like six months ago something I had

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:44,310
a task to define some branding rules for

00:02:40,349 --> 00:02:46,709
opensuse so I did bit of Investigation I

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,650
was trying to see what's open suse did

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:54,419
so far what was the material that they

00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:59,310
used and I had quite open field to act

00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:03,060
so I try to implement some bit new stuff

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,329
not just to use chameleon and green

00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:12,260
color but also to to to add something

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:16,680
new when it's coming to brand things

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:23,069
related to wood boxes I mean Cebu things

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:26,579
that should be that should be sent to

00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:31,169
events there are few things that should

00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:34,859
be considered and parted to create nice

00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:41,040
and how constant look and to come to

00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:44,129
recognition so colors the first thing

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:48,449
it's the first or somewhere in the

00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:52,290
middle it's sorry yeah it's choosing the

00:03:48,449 --> 00:03:55,530
color so as I said I decided not only to

00:03:52,290 --> 00:04:01,079
use very famous green color but also to

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:04,680
add something be different and I also

00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:07,919
learned that in the past there was also

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,470
very how important was black color so I

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,419
also try to somehow avoid this and use

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,549
let's say some other darker color which

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:20,010
is everything not the black yeah so the

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:23,430
colors are very important stuff for any

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,690
kind of brand this is the way how you

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,460
show

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:32,400
your personality the the brand

00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:36,480
personality and it gives constant look

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,300
and it's like very important to bring us

00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:42,030
to recognition so that's anywhere

00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,550
anywhere else when people see us when

00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,970
see when they see our staff they they

00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:50,910
will immediately recognize opensuse in

00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:56,310
this case we have primary and secondary

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:58,370
second secondary sorry colors and so we

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:03,570
have the green one very famous one and

00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:06,030
the dark blue color and something

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,150
between blue and green and the secondary

00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:12,840
colors are mostly you just to either

00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:18,090
bring attention to some elements or just

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,490
to show this diversity to the main

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,470
elements and of course there is always

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,260
black and white thing for the people

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:28,260
maybe let's say some kind of advice for

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:31,860
the people who are printing stuff when

00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:35,460
doing something with the black color you

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:39,270
should use rich black color which is a

00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:43,640
mixture of fifty percent of each see my

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:46,650
and hundred percent of K okay next slide

00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:51,840
the next thing is typography like

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:55,490
typography it's science so using and

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:58,830
choosing the right phones it's very

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,860
important and it should be choose very

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:04,919
carefully it's important that we not use

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:09,000
too many phones that we are not mixing

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:11,220
too many phones also we have to think in

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,250
the future so we are not using just the

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,730
font which is modern now but something

00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,890
that it will be also more than in in the

00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,780
future so here I will not go through

00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,390
details which font it's used for at

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,610
because this presentation will be

00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:29,940
available for people to download and

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,570
they can use it so you can see I use two

00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:37,310
kinds of phones and combine together

00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:37,310
they can give very nice

00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:50,919
graphic elements saw the yes yes yes

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,229
they can be downloaded on on google

00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,490
fonts that was one thing that was very

00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,809
important to us when we started doing

00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,249
the exploration we started using

00:06:55,809 --> 00:07:00,219
proprietary fonts cuz there's just a

00:06:57,249 --> 00:07:02,169
much larger set to proprietary fonts we

00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,520
realize in the end that we always will

00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:04,659
stick with the open-source font these

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,789
are all google fonts that we've

00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:08,680
downloaded I've checked with legal so

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:10,960
everything's good they're freely

00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:17,020
redistributable one of them is now in

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,550
the Installer as well so that's that is

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,809
the bigger problem is the

00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:23,259
internationalization of some of these

00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:24,939
fonts sorry the question was are we

00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,409
using open-source fonts are these

00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:27,580
proprietary runs or where we get any

00:07:26,409 --> 00:07:30,219
Swans from so they're not proprietary

00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:32,469
fonts they are open-source fonts we've

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,370
they're very widely used open-source

00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:35,490
fonts so as far as the

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,169
internationalization goes there is

00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:42,039
internationalization there but not for

00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:44,139
everything possible um realistically if

00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:46,959
you look at fully internationalized

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,909
fonts open-source fonts there's a lot of

00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:53,469
really bad ones and then like a 12 and

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:59,709
that's about it so thanks okay so

00:07:53,469 --> 00:08:03,789
graphic elements um you know so these

00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:08,439
are the main graphic elements using this

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:12,909
campaign so we have chameleon since

00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:16,120
chameleon is almost like God here so

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:18,639
it's very important person among

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:24,550
community and generally in open Susan

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:30,999
Susan so my idea was to create let's say

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:34,209
something fun and more interesting not

00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:37,419
just to use logo everywhere so I try to

00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:41,399
do some chameleon according to some my

00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:46,569
imagination and this is how we look

00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:49,960
besides that it's also that's important

00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:52,480
that for sometimes you use some

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,840
old ideas which you had before but you

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,670
just let them sit in your computer and

00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,930
sometimes it can bring something like

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:06,250
this because this can you just returned

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:10,840
yeah for example this pattern of

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:14,050
hexagons I may I created these before I

00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,600
created chameleon and actually it's

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,410
turned out that is very good thing to

00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:25,660
combine it with chameleon to get this

00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:32,020
find an interesting animal then bulb so

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:34,810
why i use bob the as i understand as i

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:38,260
understood when I arrived here that the

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:42,580
main go of open suicides to bring people

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,860
with good idea and the first thing what

00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:47,170
you the first told what I has when you

00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:51,250
said idea is the Bob so I created a

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,590
stylized bulb very simple but it should

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,760
bring attention exactly with this

00:09:53,590 --> 00:10:00,940
simplicity I march together with the

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,910
Kinect word so it's basically inviting

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:07,030
people to connect to opensuse community

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,370
and to bring the idea together without

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:12,880
with ours so that we can work together

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:20,320
or something bigger and improve it okay

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:24,070
next one for the other elements these

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,320
are let's say more these are the first

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,380
things which I made and they are more

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:32,590
rely on the on the previous things that

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:37,630
were done by community so very very

00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:39,960
simple but again using the moto that

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:43,200
opensuse have like very important moto

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:48,100
motives for opensuse so I try to

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:52,950
visualize them and to again bring

00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:56,470
attention just by this simplicity so

00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:58,990
shaping the text it's really let's say

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,500
difficult part so I try to make more

00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:03,610
interesting by creating the cubes

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,550
actually the queue

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:12,570
and it's important that all of these

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:15,850
three things are rely on each other as

00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:19,800
as the the part of the cube and the

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:22,740
three icons which are showing the

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:28,180
opensuse moto and they are like

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:31,060
continuously we didn't discard only the

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:37,800
previous designs from from the community

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:43,240
a next one layouts okay so when we

00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:46,420
whatever we create for printing in this

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,480
case for the boot boxes it's very

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:53,829
important when designing we need to pay

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:56,860
attention on proportion we need to align

00:11:53,829 --> 00:12:01,600
elements in the middle we have to follow

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:04,060
let some kind of rules so that we bring

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:08,890
attention to the things which we create

00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:13,300
and there are certain rules which has to

00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:17,310
be followed to have good design for

00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:22,269
example for brochures I try to avoid

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:26,829
using this typical format or brochure so

00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:30,959
I create a bit some different style as

00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:40,120
you can see that like smaller and very

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:47,610
different folds so no thank you the

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:52,079
other thing is M when when creating

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:56,620
either brochures or the posters it's

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:59,019
important to in this way I'm saying

00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,070
about the print stuff it's important to

00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:07,680
keep rules like for example you have to

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:10,990
keep 0.2 centimeters bleed around

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,520
documents to avoid having empty space

00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,350
because you never know what will come

00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,990
from the print and where the cut line

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,250
will be so this is important part

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,720
you should not stick your text or

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:26,020
important elements very near to the

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,490
borders or to catalyze keep it middle

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:32,830
keep it simple it's okay we can go next

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,850
one yeah so this is exactly what I said

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:39,490
about your shoes so when you have a

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:42,010
color background or the picture in the

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:45,220
background you should always let these

00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:48,310
colors or the pictures go outside of

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:51,130
your documents so once they're like cut

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:55,540
we will not have ugly white lines or

00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:58,810
something like this we can go next so

00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:01,930
this is just overview of how the

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,790
elements are aligned as you can see

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:07,950
they're like all centered it's very

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:13,720
important that when you're creating the

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:17,140
series of posters that's all primary

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,480
elements like web address or the logo

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,700
they're always in the same position but

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,230
the elements which are on the poster day

00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:31,709
of course they can be differently

00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:31,709
aligned next one this is again the same

00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:40,240
the importance of having this bleed it's

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:42,220
also showing here so it's on the posters

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,420
brochures whatever you print it's

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:50,290
important that you have this bleed next

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:55,270
one promo material so when you are

00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:58,810
applying your logo or whatever on other

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:04,079
promise promo materials you should keep

00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:07,329
it in the way that it's visible that is

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:12,810
made you have to maintain visibility and

00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:15,579
proportion and I'll go very often it's

00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,940
where the log will be defined by the

00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:23,380
printers so sometimes you cannot include

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:30,440
whatever you want but how they say okay

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:34,040
next one co-branding so the elements we

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:38,870
we created they can be used in some

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:41,450
other events um you can put you can use

00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,810
it for some low color happenings so they

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:48,740
can be reused again I would not

00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:50,540
recommend using an all these three

00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,500
elements only one poster or something

00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:58,640
like this but you can change it in a way

00:15:54,500 --> 00:16:04,340
I I took as example this conference so

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:07,040
you can replace tag line with with the

00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:11,180
conference or wither with another event

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:16,160
that you have so this is example how it

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:22,190
can be done differently yeah this is the

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:26,270
this also it's important to maintain

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:29,120
this the same and constant looks just a

00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:34,150
notch to lose this consistency for

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:37,210
example this poster is also example how

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:43,160
co-branding can be done by using the

00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:45,200
colors defined colors phones typography

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,780
so this is like the example of

00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:54,280
co-branding so how you can use it that's

00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:58,130
it always changing always fine is the 10

00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:05,620
of boosters is one of the lines in the

00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:05,620
posters so that's it some questions

00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:21,300
sorry me again so you've said which font

00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:27,070
to using are you going to be changing

00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:30,220
the font used for opensuse so if you

00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:32,350
look on the banner behind you it's still

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,050
currently in fifth leg so that where

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,790
says opensuse in green their next

00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,000
conference we're going to be changing

00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,330
that where you're going to keep that as

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:47,560
it is as if it's an image rather than

00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:50,650
text well I really think I would rather

00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:53,890
slowly move towards the using the same

00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:57,130
phones everywhere a fifth leg font is

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,020
the font which is used in logo but it

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,500
doesn't have to be used everywhere so

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,950
the text and the tag lines and the main

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:08,260
lines they that they don't have to be in

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,630
the same in the fifth leg phones so it

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,360
would be perfect if we slowly go in this

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:15,040
direction and there is a can and I think

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,200
it's important that we note that like I

00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,880
said in the beginning um we came into

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,330
this and basically we had a logo with

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,530
this font that's about it and then you

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:25,630
had some of the marketing material that

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:27,490
you saw different stuff over the ages

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,370
over the years what's new what's bad who

00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,920
knows so other than the logo we end

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,380
colors green and a logo we had very

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,570
little to go from so the first thing we

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,520
did is that as we tried to you have to

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,460
realize that this is a campaign that is

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,290
the first step in the direction of maybe

00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:46,810
where we want to go it's not a

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:48,430
definition of this is how everything is

00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:50,380
going to be from now on so this is not

00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:53,890
intended to say this is the new brand of

00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,260
suit of opensuse but rather this is the

00:18:53,890 --> 00:19:00,310
new branding elements used in the first

00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,720
campaign in the path of leading to some

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:04,380
time we're going to need to do some kind

00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,820
of rebranding or refreshing in the brand

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,380
defining elements defining things more

00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,760
more seriously because it makes it

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,710
easier for everybody who's not a

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,240
designer to be able to just take

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,500
something that's defined and use it if

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:18,150
it's well defined if it's well thought

00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:22,070
out so

00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:24,540
are you looking at potentially having

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:28,260
historically as you said the opensuse

00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,970
brand and the Souza brand were pretty

00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,420
much joined at the hip there there was

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,850
very little depreciating and honestly

00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,090
historically the opensuse brand was open

00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:40,890
tacked on in front of the Souza brand

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,170
now that Suzie brand has changed so the

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,770
logo it sells itself has changed and the

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,210
open Suzie hasn't and um because i work

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,680
for Souza I can't say I'm going to

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:51,900
officially do anything because I'm not

00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,960
the person to decide any of that but i

00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,210
would say in my sense in mic in my years

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,760
in the community is it makes no sense to

00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,530
have something like this detracting it

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,000
two tracks from open Susan attracts from

00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,530
Suzie in my opinion to have two things

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,900
that are very similar but different and

00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:10,230
slowly becoming more similar it doesn't

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,850
build two strong brands so I think the

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:13,920
long term it would be an open Susie's

00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,810
interest to rebrand itself really strong

00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,520
really and actually I if it was my

00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:23,130
opinion I'd say differently than Souza

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:25,260
but that's another issue so any other

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,970
questions first says Donna otherwise

00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,380
I'll go on through so the point of this

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:32,700
whole thing is we made this branding

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:34,590
stuff and we created these materials

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,330
basically we had a deadline to spend a

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,670
lot of money to get these materials

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,680
available for everybody to use so we had

00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,300
to do it very quickly and we started

00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,340
defining these things and at the same

00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,080
time we want to define them for

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,670
ourselves and for everybody but we also

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,140
want to make them available for everyone

00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:51,690
to you as we want it this is supposed to

00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,160
help you make branding stuff to make a

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,350
poster and make a sticker or whatever

00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,420
else and not just define things that

00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,980
make it harder for you so in doing so

00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,180
like you see this poster that we made

00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,070
which is really nice which we're going

00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,750
to make everything is available for

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,550
download the poster itself the

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:07,230
presentation itself we're also going to

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,810
make all of our branding elements all

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,660
the little community geko or the

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,490
communion comic chameleon thing the

00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,740
light bulb all the elements that we have

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,540
in there will be available as svgs in a

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,700
format that everyone can use the fonts

00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,220
are available and what I've done is I

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,170
put together a website just it's just a

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,790
file right now on my hard drive but I

00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:30,360
kind of just wanted to get an idea of

00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:31,410
how I would make a brand website so we

00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,200
have is

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,080
is something again it's very similar you

00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,760
see the colors in a very bad way with no

00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,450
break between the text and that okay

00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,280
doesn't matter well see i was doing this

00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,470
full screen on my can my monitor and now

00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:51,600
it's a smaller resolution and it's it

00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:54,480
doesn't matter it's responsive um it is

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,650
he really is so i talked about the

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,200
colors and to tell you kind of what to

00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:59,460
use interesting is that i found a quote

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,960
i was trying to find quotes for all of

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,330
these one thing i found was a quote from

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,250
pablo picasso that says they'll sell you

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:06,720
thousands of greens veronese green and

00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,130
emerald green and caddy and green any

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,670
sort of green you like but that

00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:13,230
particular green never and it makes

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:19,800
little sense but it's wonderful it's

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:21,120
pablo picasso come on um oops so we've

00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,190
got the whole typography thing it

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,500
explains how to use it and important to

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:26,580
note is that is that typography is

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,440
really something you could do your

00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:32,010
entire life it's really hard it's not

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:35,130
something for an inexperienced person to

00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:38,910
do very well without really a lot of

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:40,440
luck so typography is hard and there are

00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,790
some things that like when you guys want

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,200
to take this stuff and do something of

00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,030
your own we want to be able to

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,950
eventually you want to have an email

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,480
address where you could talk to us so

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,830
that we could give some feedback so we

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,650
could look at what you've done and say

00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,450
hey I think because we're for designers

00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,490
who do this professionally on you know

00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,440
five days a week this is our opinion

00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:59,760
whether a person takes it or not as

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,170
something else but that's the whole

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,880
point of this website is to show you

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:04,200
this first direction and give you a

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,120
place of contact to get your information

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,220
to get you know what you need to find

00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,690
the elements that you need download them

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,460
be able to change your stuff and then if

00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:13,380
you want to talk to us to say hey you

00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,550
know this is what we've done what do you

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,970
think and you know any way we can

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:20,400
improve it just like you see the

00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,800
elements it's always about the

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,270
connection between elements it's never

00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,010
about singular elements and that's where

00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,410
people mistake design is a design as a

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,030
as a whole thing and it's not just two

00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,200
pieces so having one really good piece

00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,910
and another really good piece and

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,330
putting them together does not make more

00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:40,770
than two really good pieces it might

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,330
make something really bad yeah so we got

00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:45,299
a little explanation all this really

00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,460
sucks the responsive this is great I not

00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:49,080
did not expect this but you see all the

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,570
pieces you see explanations for

00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,759
everything like the bulb is used to

00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:55,080
connect ideas the whole I think is you

00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,309
can take your ideas and connect with the

00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,749
community and that's what we were trying

00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,279
to express by using this bulb it's a

00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:02,610
very simple idea that what can use again

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,230
and again we've got explanations for

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:05,879
layout you see everything how we did

00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,739
what we did and then you can see here

00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:11,129
like you've got this x value and this is

00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:14,039
one point X X 1.8 X and 6.4 X so you

00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:15,899
could take this change it up using the

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:21,509
same ratios that we used and you get the

00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:23,519
exact same quality results so this is

00:24:21,509 --> 00:24:25,590
what we want to give to everybody and

00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:28,200
then we're showing again this co

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,639
branding idea I know this is we should

00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,009
have done it for this conference if we

00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:34,980
were going to do it for this conference

00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:37,859
but yeah so you see all these different

00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:41,220
things and again everything is available

00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:47,190
as a download there was wait let's go

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:49,109
back up that's the sound of going back

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:54,710
up noon inning inning inning inning

00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:57,289
inning inning oh come on so here you see

00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,609
that there's a download button which

00:24:57,289 --> 00:25:00,989
must work because the buttons there and

00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:07,649
it lights up when I go put my mouse over

00:25:00,989 --> 00:25:10,200
it okay so that being said I will go on

00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:13,139
to one thing so the whole point of this

00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:15,720
f of this thing was for you to be able

00:25:13,139 --> 00:25:17,899
to use for other people to be able to

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:27,019
use this without having to re-think

00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:30,710
design so basically if you had this yeah

00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:34,859
you want to make this graphic okay oops

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:37,320
don't do that go away go away okay so

00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:39,359
things meatloaf would do for love he

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,369
will clearly do anything for love but he

00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,779
won't do that so you've made this

00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:44,220
graphic and now you think you know I

00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:45,809
think I've done it right i mean i've

00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,330
explained very clearly that he'll do

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:49,859
anything but he won't do that right you

00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,749
know you've got a nice readable text

00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,669
it's on a white background i can clearly

00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:55,740
see what the information is there but

00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:57,539
then maybe you want it to be branded as

00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,680
well so you would look at our website

00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,310
and there

00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:04,770
um you would make something like that

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:07,170
yay it's kind of branded it's better and

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:10,380
it matches more than it would if you

00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:12,810
didn't follow these rules so and that is

00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,890
it for us I think we're available for

00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:18,480
questions we're here all week so if

00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,860
anybody needs anything if anybody wants

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:26,070
to talk anything don't hesitate and

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:28,290
again me I fed you these questions

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:32,340
beforehand thanks for asking them yeah

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:39,680
invoices in the post so would you guys

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:44,520
be willing to sit down and help create

00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:46,680
something following on your campaign

00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:49,410
ideas so for instance a lot of people

00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,600
using reveal Jas now for presentations

00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:55,530
whatever else it would be nice to be

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:57,500
able to have it branded yeah I think

00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,900
definitely I think what we need other

00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,320
other tools like that so I don't know

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:07,220
maybe not necessarily wordpress theme or

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:10,530
whatever but those kind of things that

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:13,650
people would quite happily reuse easily

00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:19,430
reuse and it gets the brand out much

00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:21,870
wider and slowly but surely people go

00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,270
clearly they do something with open seas

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:25,050
or whatever I mean realistically if

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,640
you're going to go to give a

00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:28,680
presentation about opensuse no matter

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,050
where you go it's a lot more work for

00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,580
you to take something in plane and empty

00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,860
and try to create your own template and

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,410
thanks something up than it is to take a

00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,030
well created template and adapt it to

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,650
your needs i realize that everyone's

00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:41,970
going to adapt things so these are

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:43,620
guidelines and that's why we don't call

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,820
them rules other at a company this would

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,410
be a rule and you'd follow it whether

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:48,240
you liked it or not whether it made bad

00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,010
results or not but we're not saying that

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,430
so yeah looking at something like reveal

00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,320
Jas for a presentation maybe like we're

00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,910
using a bootstrap for all of our

00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,350
websites maybe some you know a template

00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,420
for that so you could say if you want to

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:05,610
make it opensuse website this is how it

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:07,440
looks in baby steps you know this is why

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:08,850
we've started here I mean this is the

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,260
first presentation that we've even done

00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,490
in front of any of the community we have

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,310
it we've kind of stayed out of the

00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,830
community light

00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:17,140
cuz we had a date to get this stuff

00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,490
printed by and it was a lot of stress to

00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,200
deal with finding the companies who

00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:22,180
would print things in time with the

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,800
right kind of invoices and then getting

00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:26,080
the invoices you don't know it was a lot

00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,670
of work behind this it wasn't just make

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,950
some art work and then say printed off

00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:35,860
didn't work like that this brand it's

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,350
not only two say people I mean it's not

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,900
to say people what to do but it's

00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:42,670
shortened a time of choosing the colors

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:45,250
the phones so they way they will

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:47,800
immediately not okay I have I don't know

00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,540
two different fonts which I can use I

00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,400
will pick this one or I'll pick that one

00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:52,990
and that's it you spend five minutes so

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,840
you don't have to go through phones try

00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:57,970
prints see how it looks if it is better

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:03,190
this one or that one so so this is where

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:06,010
it you how to help people to to make

00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:09,340
their best in shortest time and this is

00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:13,780
just first step so slowly we are going

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,850
in that direction that everything is at

00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,350
the same time we also have discussed i

00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:19,870
think is a question my cup here at the

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:22,750
same time we also discuss creating like

00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:26,200
maybe open office file or Libre Office

00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:28,510
files or SVG files where a person can

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,910
take the poster that we made and just

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:32,320
change the text you know the right font

00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,940
is already there you'd have to have

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,870
those fonts installed on your system yes

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:45,100
i agree but given yeah i think that

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:47,310
would be really nice hey I have the

00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,310
microphone

00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:55,909
so just a few comments on so the website

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,669
which is currently a file here on Ken's

00:29:55,909 --> 00:30:02,269
machine is going to go live on opensuse

00:29:58,669 --> 00:30:04,129
dork in the near future and it is a

00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:08,269
starting point okay this is starting

00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:11,359
point so please anybody who is part of

00:30:08,269 --> 00:30:14,079
the you know artwork that we see here

00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:16,789
and that has been done for other events

00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,719
don't feel stepped on your toes we have

00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:22,399
you know we have great resources now

00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:24,440
they've done a wonderful job of giving

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,950
us a starting point and everybody please

00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,979
take that opportunity the design team is

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,779
more than willing as ken said earlier

00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:34,609
there will be an email address where you

00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:37,119
can go and say this is what I've done

00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:40,399
can you help me make it nicer and better

00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:42,139
so all of that is there and this will be

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,119
a starting point we will hang this

00:30:42,139 --> 00:30:47,559
website that we currently that you've

00:30:44,119 --> 00:30:50,419
seen off of opensuse at work so

00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:52,849
everybody can access it there's also

00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:56,139
work going on and finding an easier

00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:58,789
place for designers to collaborate

00:30:56,139 --> 00:31:01,489
currently all of our artwork is on

00:30:58,789 --> 00:31:04,159
github and while this works really great

00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:06,499
for us that write code it sucks for

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,229
people that design stuff right because

00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:10,849
although there's really only five or six

00:31:09,229 --> 00:31:13,879
commands that you need to know to work

00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:16,009
with github if that's not your mindset

00:31:13,879 --> 00:31:18,109
it really doesn't work and so there's

00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,509
stuff going on that we're talking about

00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:23,089
to make it easy for everybody in the in

00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:26,239
the design team and that's helping with

00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:28,729
the artwork to collaborate and you know

00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:30,919
make our brand better it's also the

00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:32,989
github repo takes a couple hours on a

00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,959
really good internet connection to even

00:31:32,989 --> 00:31:37,339
pull at all so right it's very very

00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:39,349
unusual and it's also a matter of

00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:41,450
finding the information what's the

00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:44,839
actual latest stuff right now it's kind

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,579
of a mess and we would like to take part

00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,889
in that conversation as to what is

00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:50,329
needed I think because we are for

00:31:48,889 --> 00:31:52,159
professional designers to do this stuff

00:31:50,329 --> 00:31:54,289
you know for years and years and years

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,469
we probably have a very good idea of

00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:59,779
what we think is right so we want to

00:31:57,469 --> 00:32:00,980
this is like basically our first step to

00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:02,840
say to the community

00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,640
you're ready to help we're here and

00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,110
until now we had to get this stuff done

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,610
we had to get it out the door it had to

00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,169
be printed so there was very little time

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:11,840
for us to have any discussions with

00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:15,020
community members but now is definitely

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,690
the time and from here on out everything

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:20,450
that we do for with or for opensuse will

00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,980
be discussed openly and like I said like

00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:24,049
having a file where a person just goes

00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,510
in and tight changes some text is a

00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:28,220
really good idea because then Ludwig

00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,840
could make posters from now on so some

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,309
when it comes a can I need a poster and

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,150
I'd say yeah go talk to Ludwig you know

00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:38,780
he does the posters here hey like that

00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:40,280
don't you yeah so from now on if you got

00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:44,240
any questions like the email address i

00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:47,900
think is el Moussa let's ooze a day just

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,480
send it to him no so yeah we'd like to

00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,980
help you and we definitely want to be

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,960
able to help and what you see I think in

00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,520
the future is also that our team because

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,669
we have four designers who have all

00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,230
different sets of competencies you will

00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:02,480
see that like Swiss Donna for instance

00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:04,700
is really good at print design we have

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,590
another designer who says I don't like

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,850
my design I want to do print design she

00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,830
doesn't do print design she's in another

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:11,870
area so we have people who do different

00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:15,650
things and we want to be able to help in

00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:17,270
all different areas um so slowly but

00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:19,280
surely you'll see us starting to become

00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,919
a little bit more active in different

00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,960
areas we also we've already created a

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,790
couple different just fun desktop

00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,110
backgrounds just while we're you know

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,640
playing around and stuff like that we're

00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:31,580
going to push that out sometime

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,720
hopefully soon there's two different

00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:34,640
versions that are done that are very

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,830
different that are very interesting so

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,210
you'll see more and more from us but

00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:42,770
don't take it as any kind of any kind of

00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,570
rule or anything we are just as much

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,299
community as every other community

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:48,799
member out there it's just I guess it's

00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:50,360
easy for us when you say you want to

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,390
spend thirty thousand bucks printing

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:55,010
flyers it's easier to go you do it then

00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:59,090
it is to find a community member to do

00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:04,549
it okay so when you wait a little any

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:06,500
other questions no oh yep and like I

00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:07,490
said if anyone has any longer terms if

00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,649
you feel like you wanted to sit down

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,540
with us for an hour to help us to

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:13,220
anything whatever we're here all week so

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,839
talk to us

00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,069
and this is kind of a dumb question I

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,940
don't know why it popped into my head

00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:23,970
but is there any recommendation over

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,490
which way the Gecko should face or can

00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:29,429
it go both ways well being historically

00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:31,409
it Susan I remember when it used to face

00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:33,679
the other way naturally speaking I think

00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:37,710
back in the day the argument was that

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,960
forward is to the right so things going

00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:41,429
to the right is forward-looking I would

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,740
realistically say that like right now

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:45,000
with this geek oh there's problems with

00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,730
it because it's different than the sousa

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,980
geko now so it dilutes the Souza brand

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,510
and dilute sits or souza to lose this

00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,240
brand or this blue you know they dilute

00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:57,270
each other there's small differences in

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,380
them which is bad just bad it's bad to

00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,970
have two things that are really really

00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,730
similar and just slightly different um

00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,349
and as far as like just changing the

00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:06,450
direction of things I would be very

00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:08,400
hesitant to do that because that's again

00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,530
one small step that you would take that

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,750
makes it one further step away from what

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:15,180
it is from what the other brand is I

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,400
think that realistically we need to look

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:20,010
at the Souza brand and the opensuse

00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,809
brand and differentiate them make a

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,160
decision as to differentiation the big

00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:26,099
thing is that there's copywriting

00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,540
trademarks and so it's a really

00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:30,500
complicated thing that needs to be

00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,720
decided at a higher level I and

00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:35,880
realistically to rebrand just a

00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,069
community now this isn't a huge company

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,210
this is just a community to rebrand

00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:45,270
opensuse would be for several designers

00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:47,010
years of work so this is not something

00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,290
that's going to happen in six months or

00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:51,450
a year I'm talking if I start if we

00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,609
started today our team started today in

00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:56,430
two or three years we would be ready

00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:58,859
with a new brand realistically and

00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:00,900
that's saying I when I say rebrand I

00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:03,420
mean really rebrand everything so not

00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,829
you know just change the logo and that's

00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,660
the decisions that we need to make you

00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,220
know what how much of the rebranding do

00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,260
we need to do what what kind of

00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:13,559
rebranding are we refreshing the brand

00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,960
are we replacing the brand and now those

00:36:13,559 --> 00:36:17,819
are all huge questions that I am scared

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:19,049
to ask but I wanted to bring it up here

00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:20,220
because I think it's very important I

00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:21,990
say this again and again when we talk

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,490
about the brand you know probably hear

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,079
me say it every time I talk to you

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,650
because I think it's very important for

00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:29,230
a designer right now it's very

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:31,390
hard to come in and know what to do you

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:32,800
see you got a logo and screen and that's

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,630
the first thing this is the best part

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,770
and you know it's true when I come up

00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:37,120
and pull some like this and this thing

00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:39,040
is really nice right it looks really

00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,310
nice take a look at it and people say

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,720
yeah but it's not really green is it so

00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,340
you're telling me that Susan so if I

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,410
just make it green just any kind of

00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,450
green just some random green bright

00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:52,510
green then it's Susan and that's

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,710
interesting but sad it makes it really

00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:55,510
hard for a designer to do his job

00:36:53,710 --> 00:37:00,940
because you have green and you've got a

00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:02,770
logo that's green okay so yeah that's

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,270
where I think it should go but what I

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,410
think is not necessarily what everyone

00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:07,150
else thinks and I think that'll be a

00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,820
bigger issue coming up in the future I

00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:12,700
was just thinking from the orientation

00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:16,450
perspective like it could potentially

00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:19,000
have an impact on whether you place it

00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:20,590
to the left or to the right of some you

00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,600
know project title or something like

00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:26,710
that because it might look a bit weird

00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:29,350
if you have the Gecko facing away from

00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:31,330
the text or right really kind of thing

00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:34,060
but then maybe you don't want you you

00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:35,320
want it on the left hand side or the

00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:37,570
right hand side depending on the shape

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:41,050
of the text or I'll be honest with you

00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:42,700
it was up to me i rename it I would not

00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,290
name it opensuse i'd name it like

00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,120
something else and have a completely

00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:47,950
different like deco linux and have a

00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,700
completely different logo and it

00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:53,940
completely separate there is branding

00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,650
wise marketing-wise there are no ties

00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:58,150
there's no ties between Suzanne open

00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,780
sewers that i can see that i can clearly

00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,370
see and I I know where the opensuse

00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,170
brand came from but I just think it's

00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:07,750
outdated now and it's slowly kind of

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:09,340
getting decrepit is falling apart it's

00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:13,120
not solid anymore and it's not strong

00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:15,250
and I think it just hurts both wouldn't

00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:17,620
you be xubuntu maybe we could go for

00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:19,060
that oh god coming from me I'm gonna

00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,280

you very much I appreciate that thank

00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:31,000
you yeah hi mark alright so okay any

00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,880
other questions anybody anybody anybody

00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,860
anybody buddy want some free marketing

00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,090
stuff catch no Stefan you're not quick

00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,440
at all

00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:43,510
so you've got all this stuff which

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,320
you've done for all this wonderful print

00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:48,790
design theoretically speaking if we

00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:50,530
accept that some of these guidelines and

00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:53,590
started using them as a basis for let's

00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:55,000
say the asstt installer would you would

00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,410
you think that's a good idea what I

00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,670
sorry I didn't hear the last but what do

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,190
you think it's a good idea if we started

00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:01,900
using these guidelines to also in sort

00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,850
of the screen design side of things yes

00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,170
to the Installer I think that we should

00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:07,560
probably look into it did you seen the

00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:13,000
new installer from Susie we have its

00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:14,610
yeah it's kind of um and I think you're

00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,840
going to see more and more of this um

00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:18,280
one thing that i am going to promise now

00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,290
is it because I've changed the installer

00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:22,480
and Souza and I hear that some of that

00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:25,660
might actually go then back upstream

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:28,210
into opensuse I promise that I will take

00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:30,880
the theme that I made for Souza itself

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:32,290
and make an opensuse themed version for

00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,910
it because that's cheap to just change

00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,340
everything and then go I screw up your

00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:38,020
stuff I want you fix it so I will change

00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,120
that um that's going to be me you have

00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,010
to accept yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so

00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,080
yeah I'm just gonna you know grep the

00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:48,400
colors and like said things and that's

00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:52,420
it um yeah does that answer a question

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,760
okay yeah we got to go pretty soon we

00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,280
got one more question we're done what do

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,350
you say who has the strongest brand from

00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,460
your perspective from the other Linux

00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:05,790
distribution that's a loaded question

00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,830
that's not fair that's not fair um

00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:10,180
actually I worked at canonical

00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:11,560
previously I don't know if anyone knew

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,060
that but I worked at Sue's er left

00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:15,490
worked at four canonical now i'm working

00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,390
for Susie again and having experienced

00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:20,710
the effort that went on in rebranding

00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:24,130
canonical itself as well as we went to

00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,870
its eye-opening um if you've never been

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:28,210
through that process you probably can't

00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:31,120
imagine what it really involves how much

00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:34,630
effort involves to do it that well um

00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:36,160
yeah it's this is everyone sees a logo

00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:38,080
and they think oh you guys probably made

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,750
like three versions or logos and we

00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:43,390
picked one and we're done it's more like

00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:45,670
we made three hundred versions and then

00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,860
from that we made another 30 and then

00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:51,190
another 30 you know and so it's a lot of

00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,510
work and I would honestly say that the

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,839
work that canonical did is very very

00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:54,249
very

00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:55,420
good the designers they have a very

00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:58,779
professional they have a really large

00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,609
team doing a very good job so but that's

00:40:58,779 --> 00:41:06,880
also again a company behind something

00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:10,950
it's not community doing it itself yay

00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,950
