if those at Sousa don't raise their

00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,509
hands I'm pretty okay Roman and yours

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,400
already not listening to my session

00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:13,170
animal that's a good start within the

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,070
first five minutes yeah but I'm not like

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,810
Hannah and throw stuff at them so

00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,350
actually the other way around

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:24,570
interesting so let's talk a little bit

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,130
about who is using open source software

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:37,500
in the enterprise anyone any ideas Bruno

00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:39,690
who is using it who the CIO the CIO is

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,239
using okay I was more thinking about who

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:45,059
not in terms of the CIO or the CEO

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,090
actually he might also use it the CFO as

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,940
well maybe even the front desk uses it

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,829
but I mean who in terms of companies who

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,840
comes to your mind enterprises

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:58,289
businesses who do you think is using

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,980
open source software article is using

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:07,890
open source software okay who else

00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:09,720
google google is example as well London

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,430
Stock Exchange yeah that's one of the

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:18,799
more exotic things but true any other

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,799
ideas who might use open source software

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:29,850
everyone who's connected to the Internet

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:32,250
well that well that's good most of the

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,630
web companies most of the companies who

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,360
are using the web as the primary

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,360
interface are using open source software

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,590
big data analysis yeah there are open

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:50,369
source suit usages for it yeah anyone is

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:52,920
a very close thing because what I

00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:57,060
realized is where we're focusing pretty

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,799
much on the server side of things and on

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,790
the operating system side or on the web

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:09,229
server side of things but Android is a

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:12,229
good example as well so iOS yeah yeah

00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,229
WebKit

00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:23,370
yeah TVs using open source software but

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,750
basically what Romans had is the right

00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,620
thing anyone is using open source

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,890
software in most companies you will find

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,840
Firefox as the default web browser

00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:36,360
independent of the operating system so

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,099
that's open source software many

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,599
companies are using Thunderbird for

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:46,590
emailing there are very much very many

00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:49,560
other examples for that and so as an end

00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:53,340
result really everyone can use it and

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:56,280
most are using it today and this really

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,739
ranges from the small enterprise the

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,579
small bakery around the corner that

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:05,810
might do their shopping for floor and

00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:09,420
stuff like that over the internet using

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,400
Firefox most likely going against an

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:16,200
Apache web server which is also again

00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:17,519
open source and we actually have open

00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,519
source software all around us

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,160
independent of business enterprise world

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,430
or personal life like just pointed out

00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:28,560
even iOS has open source components

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:34,200
though Apple is not seen as an open

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:37,230
source company so why why are companies

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,780
using open source software what are the

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:48,870
reasons for it cheap yeah open source

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:51,450
software is cheap then our independence

00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:59,120
yes everyone knows what vendor lock-in

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:59,120
is right you don't know it all

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:11,590
yeah some companies might not know that

00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:15,310
it's open source that's true but that's

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:17,959
also true they don't know it quality

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,880
quality can be upon what what do you

00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:24,889
mean with quality of open source

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:27,020
software I mean if I well openness is

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,810
out but open SSL is a good example for

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,500
quality I mean even there was the

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,990
heartbleed issue in openssl it was

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,130
public pretty much when was discovered

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:42,590
and it got fixed if there is an issue in

00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:45,380
some proprietary software that might be

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:52,430
a severe issue do you really know about

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:56,720
it will it hit the tack news do you

00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:59,750
think it will in any case no most likely

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,570
or pretty much we can't tell if it will

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:05,120
hit the news or not someone is reporting

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:07,010
this issue to the proprietary vendor he

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,310
might fix it or he might decide to not

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:12,020
fix it but with open source well there

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:14,950
is quite some pressure at least for some

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,229
components to actually fix broken and

00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:20,690
security relevant stuff and also in a

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:22,849
timely manner so that can also be a

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:26,830
reason why companies are using open

00:05:22,849 --> 00:05:29,840
source despite being vendor-independent

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:32,020
any other reasons that you can think

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,020
about

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:48,430
yeah enjoying some guarantees from a

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,430
licensed might be among the reasons

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:59,509
anything else it's easy to integrate

00:05:53,419 --> 00:06:01,759
really it's open source you can adapt it

00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:09,910
that's the point you can change it you

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:09,910
can adapt it to your needs that sorry

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:20,360
yes yeah why their industry support

00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:23,840
that's also true it's wider support more

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,720
people actually working on it then it

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,669
might be the case for a single company

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,310
if you just look at who is contributing

00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,050
to the colonel and how much developers

00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,240
are working on things like the linux

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,639
kernel then this is nothing that any

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:44,300
single company can provide in terms of

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:46,550
developer resources yeah of course well

00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,690
yeah it's the standard also in many

00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,310
areas that's also true but then it's not

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:55,250
a net it's not really an active choice

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,970
anymore it's like you are locked in to

00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:02,539
you have the bandra login into open

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:09,169
source basically but in there you got

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:12,740
all of the choices trust trust can also

00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:18,909
be a reason to choose it trust in the

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,909
community you know what it does

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,140
yeah you have access to the code you can

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:28,790
identify what it does if you are

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,120
interested in that part and you can

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:42,800
typically not do that with proprietary

00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:47,050
software any more reasons get fixes

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,900
quite quickly that might be a reason but

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:53,330
but there is no guarantee for it so you

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,010
will get a fix eventually but if it's

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:58,220
really timely or more timely with

00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:04,940
proprietary hmm can be a reason I

00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:08,060
wouldn't put it that high on my list it

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:13,120
is a good reason you will get fixes and

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:16,760
you can get them maybe more quickly so

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,390
one of the main reasons for companies to

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:27,260
use open source is definitely the cost

00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:30,470
reduction thing I t has is no longer

00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:33,680
something that you really want to invest

00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,140
into as a company as long as you're not

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,260
a technology company but it is something

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,750
you need to do and it's merely a cost

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,810
Center anymore so you want to keep you

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,370
won't need to use more IT resources

00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:48,530
specifically as all of us now have

00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,589
smartphones we are used to easy

00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:54,290
technology access so you need to have

00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:56,930
quite a lot of technology a lot of IT

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,670
but of course you don't want to spend

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,010
millions of dollars on your IT

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,130
infrastructure specifically if that's

00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:08,930
not your primary income sector say

00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:10,790
you're you're out of mobile in the

00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,910
automotive industry you are building

00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:15,380
cars then you are making money of cars

00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:17,120
you're not making money of your IT

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,070
infrastructure of course if your IT

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,820
infrastructure certain at some point in

00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:25,430
time breaks you're doomed you're not

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:28,940
making any money anymore but in the

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:31,760
first place use of open source is mainly

00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,329
at least from a decision maker level it

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,689
is we want to save money by using up

00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:42,410
or software the philosophy behind it

00:09:38,689 --> 00:09:45,079
might be interesting to some of the

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,899
decision makers but it's mostly for the

00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,239
techies that might have the philosophy

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:52,309
and mind and that might also see the

00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:54,499
other good reasons like getting fixes

00:09:52,309 --> 00:10:00,230
earlier having the ability to look into

00:09:54,499 --> 00:10:03,170
the code and things like that so what

00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:06,429
open source components are actually used

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:08,749
in the enterprise what can you think of

00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:10,610
we already talked about basically the

00:10:08,749 --> 00:10:12,709
operating system and where the opensuse

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:16,790
conference so obviously the operating

00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:18,619
system web companies using apache we

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:21,139
talked about firefox but are there any

00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:23,259
other things that you have on top of

00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:31,779
your mind that people are using

00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:31,779
databases true databases any other

00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:42,309
version control systems yeah mostly if

00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:42,309
you're a tech company web server yeah

00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:54,040
firewall security related things we had

00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:58,209
openssl any other things they sorry

00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:02,779
desktop software yep that's among those

00:10:58,209 --> 00:11:04,790
anything else you know that that's open

00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:09,309
source and that's used in enterprises

00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,309
all that might be used in enterprises

00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:14,239
development framework yeah again if

00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:21,049
you're a tech company of your a software

00:11:14,239 --> 00:11:25,220
company mail servers yet also a good

00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:27,799
part of it there are actually business

00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:30,100
applications out there that are open

00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,350
source there are things like open erp

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:38,290
which provides you with an open source

00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:43,819
alternative to solutions provided by big

00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:46,399
blue or red corporations so they are

00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:48,630
open source they provide you with HR

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:55,260
software CRM

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:58,530
stock mmmm management solutions

00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:03,270
budgeting finance applications and so on

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:06,070
there are whole small enterprise server

00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:08,080
solutions available that integrate with

00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,410
the operating system that deliver you

00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,240
basically what this big rapman company

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:17,760
used to deliver in their small business

00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:21,820
server mail solution directory server

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:28,900
but also enterprise applications on top

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:30,880
of it so it's really the whole range of

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:33,550
open source software that is used in the

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,510
enterprise it really goes from just the

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:38,980
operating system to full-blown

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:41,860
applications everything and there are

00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:45,280
open source enterprise applications

00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:48,460
available so you can really build an

00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,400
enterprise on top of completely relying

00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:57,100
on open source software with no need for

00:12:51,400 --> 00:13:00,070
any proprietary software parts inside so

00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:04,750
now to the interesting part about open

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:09,580
source open source is about giving and

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:13,210
taking so so far we have talked about

00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,850
who is using open source why are they

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,040
using open source what are they using

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,230
but the interesting question is where at

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,380
an open source event is are they

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:29,250
actually giving something back what's

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,250
your take yeah

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,180
the crown is mostly developed by paid

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:44,459
developers yeah that's true there are

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:46,680
contributions Miley Intel Oracle also

00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:49,829
Microsoft contributing to the caramel

00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,990
then of course redhead Souza and so on

00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,940
but what about this I mean we talked

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,829
about who is using it and we actually

00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:58,250
identified that it's really from the

00:13:55,829 --> 00:14:01,070
small bakery around the corner to

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:04,320
enterprises like London Stock Exchange

00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:12,180
who is giving back and are they actually

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:22,740
giving back most of them are not that's

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:26,399
true unfortunately yeah some of them are

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,430
giving back by buying support from some

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,060
company or some individual who might be

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:37,699
working on a project like i mentioned

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,699
open erp if you want

00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:43,959
for you because it's not that easy

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,999
doable so you are paying someone and

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:52,870
that one might be a contributor so you

00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:54,370
are giving back indirectly some are

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,360
paying to develop new features yeah

00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:00,279
that's what we also heard from in many

00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,620
cases and that's what the business model

00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:04,870
for many consulting open source

00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,839
consulting companies actually is you

00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:14,649
need a feature in open source so please

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:16,240
develop it any other I did they provide

00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:18,879
infrastructure yeah that's also a good

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,629
point some of them are hosting open

00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,610
source project so also more or less

00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:31,779
indirectly giving back to the open

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:35,290
source community so if we want to face

00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:38,259
the reality than some are contributing

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:40,600
it's really the minority and some are

00:15:38,259 --> 00:15:43,059
contributing more some are contributing

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,259
less there are companies that are

00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:50,110
extremely active as a open-source users

00:15:47,259 --> 00:15:52,329
and they are extremely contributing back

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,990
and I'm not talking necessarily about

00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:58,360
the open-source companies but rather

00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,939
about the closed source proprietary

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,230
companies that are actually using it do

00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:07,059
business that are actually contributing

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:09,579
quite a lot into that space but the vast

00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:14,040
majority of companies who is using open

00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,040
source unfortunately is not giving back

00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:21,850
universities are giving back typically

00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:23,949
in one way or the other and they are

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:28,689
also a good amount of users of

00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:32,350
open-source software well end-user

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:38,199
donations are one thing but what I

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:40,179
always get the impression is we have

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:42,639
companies using open-source software and

00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:44,439
that seems to be and many people are

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,459
complaining about them not giving back

00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:50,949
and you bring up a very good point how

00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:52,120
many end uses do we have that use open

00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:55,390
source software

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,870
and how much are they giving back if we

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,820
look at statistics from opensuse for

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,940
example how many people downloaded

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:06,400
opensuse who are using it and how many

00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:10,740
are contributing back that's also the

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:41,040
same applies as for enterprises so

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:44,470
actually you disagree Robert that's true

00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:47,590
many use at least or they talk to their

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:50,110
friends about it i'm using opensuse or

00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:52,809
debian or whatever why don't you use it

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:55,720
or i'm using this open-source tool why

00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:57,880
don't you use it so yeah that's true

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,100
there also give name might give back

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,170
more because when have you last heard

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,800
your Baker telling you that he's using

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:11,340
firefox to browse the web or your bank

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:14,740
banks ATM which might not run this

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:16,929
unsupported redman product anymore but

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,940
maybe might run on some open source

00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:22,870
solution when have you heard your bank

00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:24,250
talk about that most likely never but

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:28,059
there are some out there that are

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:32,530
actually doing that so yeah users might

00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:34,330
give back more but some companies are

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,240
giving back and that's already a good

00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:39,460
start and I think we also need to make

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,350
sure that we make it easy for them to

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:47,500
give back and actually licensing for

00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:50,800
that part is a good way of ensuring that

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,780
they can give back because companies are

00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,300
typically afraid of anything that has to

00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:59,890
do with licensing or copyrights and

00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,840
stuff like that and unfortunately i'm

00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,990
already at the end of my session that's

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:11,490
way too quick

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:13,290
hmm make something up that's good so for

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,790
the next 30 minutes of my session I'm

00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:25,730
going to dance on this table okay let's

00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:29,610
not do that let me think about that so

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:32,370
so are there any questions around this

00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:35,429
topic I mean you decided to go into this

00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:37,200
session so you maybe had something in

00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:43,140
mind that I would be talking about and

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:47,220
most likely did not we know let me

00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:54,690
appoint you to be the runner with a

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:59,030
microphone okay a question or when idea

00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:02,670
is it's really difficult for a small

00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:06,690
price users of open-source software to

00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:09,720
say okay I we really use and love to use

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:16,140
this product in in a in our enterprise

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:18,900
and how we can give back the easiest

00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:23,520
thing to do for an enterprise is giving

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:27,330
back money but giving back money hasn't

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:32,370
and legal entity has some rules to be

00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:35,760
respect and so how I didn't didn't have

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:40,200
an answer about how can community

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:44,540
projects be more aware about the fact

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:50,160
how the nation made by an enterprise

00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:52,830
could be more smooth well the easiest

00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:57,270
solution for that one is actually always

00:20:52,830 --> 00:21:00,390
to found some kind of foundation because

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:03,720
if you look at many open-source projects

00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:07,880
then it is hard to donate money to them

00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:11,160
because there is no entity to donate to

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,770
so Michael mix in his keynote talked

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,230
about the different formats that you can

00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,740
use and why they did it for the document

00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:18,960
found

00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,620
and that's pretty much one reason you

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,910
have a legal entity that you can give to

00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:29,070
that you can donate money to and the

00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:32,610
only thing that you could actually do as

00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:34,740
a company is go to some other company

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,100
that you know is working on this open

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:41,850
source project and fund a week of

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:45,200
development on whatever they might

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:48,330
actually need so that's one way of

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,510
giving back like going to one of the

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,010
consulting companies and buying a week

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,620
of bug fixing or something like that

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:59,120
that's one way to achieve it and the

00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:01,290
other one would be for the actual

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,740
project or the actual open source

00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:08,610
software component to create a

00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:11,970
foundation wherever in the world that's

00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:16,550
typically not that important anymore and

00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,550
allow for donations to that entity you

00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:25,559
will get the microphone there's fortune

00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,050
well for better or worse no shortcoming

00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:30,120
of foundations who will happily take and

00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:31,710
process the money I mean there's the

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,090
document foundation there's like the FSF

00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,679
there is suffering the public interest

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,110
there is software Conservancy there's no

00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,750
there's so many foundations and well

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:42,480
it's well if you only want to handle

00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,429
money then it might be easier smart and

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,020
much more straightforward to just well

00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:48,090
go to one of those organizations who

00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,350
will happily deal with that of course

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,910
for resilience reasons for the

00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,350
resiliency reasons might be smart you

00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:56,340
still haven't have a year have a known

00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,230
predation but well for sure there are

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:04,980
already a lot of foundations out there

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:06,470
but if i'm not using gnome but i want to

00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,660
give back to the project that i'm using

00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:18,679
then the clown foundation is not really

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:18,679
the right source to go to yeah true

00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:43,100
true any more questions on the topic I

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,780
think it's impressive that I although I

00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:48,170
didn't say anything I cover what you

00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:51,110
wanted to hear are there any good

00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,570
reasons for companies not to use open

00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,400
source software especially what do you

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:59,210
think are valid reasons for in some

00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:10,330
cases choosing clothes source that's a

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:12,680
tough one yeah so so that's one thing

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:16,390
the reason that everyone can make

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:21,230
changes to it is something where you

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:25,610
might have reasons to say okay I don't

00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:34,420
want to use open source software for

00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:34,420
that but what

00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:45,610
I don't I don't know we we should we

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,500
should possibly talk to the developer of

00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:52,120
the presentation software I'm using and

00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,880
donate some money to him to fix it so

00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,560
pretty much all of the reasons apply

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,740
there are good reasons as well like

00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:02,580
software not being available or as I

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:05,890
mentioned the blue and the red company

00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:09,820
for erp solutions or for business

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:11,860
applications open era PLP certainly

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,260
doesn't scale that well compared to

00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:16,750
those applications so if you really have

00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:19,630
a massive amount of data there are good

00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:24,040
reasons to go to a proprietary lender

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:28,330
and buy their solution instead but there

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:30,040
is no reason to fully rely on one

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,480
proprietary vendor and there are

00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:33,550
actually a number of good reasons

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,490
besides those that we mentioned to not

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:39,730
fully rely on one the vendor lock-in

00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:42,460
that we talked about is really like you

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,100
have the full choice in open source and

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,990
it's not only about the applications

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,510
that use but you can also choose the

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:53,290
provider you go to you can easily

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:55,390
migrate your directory service from one

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:58,300
distribution to the next because it's

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:01,380
still basically the same but if you try

00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:04,330
to migrate from one proprietary

00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:08,110
directory service to another one that

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:10,930
might not be that easily possible so

00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,720
you're really free to pick and choose

00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:23,520
who you are using for which part of your

00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:23,520
stack home on wake up

00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:35,789
no okay any other questions I still need

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:41,529
to fill up 15 minutes come on help me I

00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:47,049
am well hello if for example for open

00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:49,779
suse how we can resolve the case to say

00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:55,120
okay we would like to see some set in

00:26:49,779 --> 00:27:00,070
figs inside our project whatever and we

00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:03,940
say we we make a call to users and to

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:08,049
find some legal entities or enterprise

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:11,470
mental helping in sponsoring the hack

00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:20,289
wake or back at them somewhere with some

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:28,330
people how things will happen how that's

00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:32,260
a good question and so I mean for the

00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:36,220
concrete quedas case of opensuse you can

00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:40,600
find basically any company and set up

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:44,919
something for that I imagine it is not

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:50,649
just okay are we do really something it

00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:54,760
is a cross needed a crossing sorry a

00:27:50,649 --> 00:28:00,730
cross near by several enterprise I want

00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:03,460
to stick together yeah pick a place we

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:06,010
know that most of the time one of the

00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:12,520
students office is a key place because

00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:16,850
we can access key people is easy ha

00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:19,370
easier easier than if we are outside or

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:27,289
if we try to bring these people during

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:28,610
one week yeah I think I know where

00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:31,850
you're heading to but I'm the wrong one

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:36,260
to talk to you about that okay so in in

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:38,600
general if you are in a company and you

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:40,460
want to do something for the open source

00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,630
community or for an open source project

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,419
you can of course always go there and

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:49,880
organize a hackathon or whatever

00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:52,789
together with this project and fund them

00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:58,100
a fun week in I don't know Dubrovnik

00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:59,570
Croatia to work on the project that's

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,669
always something that you can do if

00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:04,100
there are multiple enterprises then it

00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:06,260
gets a lot more complicated because then

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,890
you're again in this situation where you

00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:11,870
need some legal entity to handle the

00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,390
money that five different companies are

00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:19,520
giving you but that could for example

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:24,950
also be one of those companies so that's

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:30,559
not an unsolvable problem now Roman has

00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:32,360
a question now I have another one very

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,740
often developers don't really like it if

00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,659
there are companies that make use of

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,669
open source software and don't

00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:40,549
contribute anything back to it or even

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:44,150
sell open source or open source software

00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:47,230
is there anything we can do as an

00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:49,309
integrator like we are one or as

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:53,200
companies that make use of open source

00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:56,539
and support it to remove that type of

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,570
mistrust and distrust and also did you

00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:04,730
know that certain attitude type of

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:07,750
disgrace I think there's very little

00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:10,309
that you can do about people not liking

00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:13,640
enterprises using their software and not

00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,990
giving back that's a an attitude thing

00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,490
and I don't think that you can really

00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,999
change that or that there are any

00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:24,719
measures to change it I think

00:30:20,999 --> 00:30:26,459
you can try different approaches like be

00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:28,139
happy that someone is using your

00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:30,569
software and not only for fun but

00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:33,779
actually for achieving something for

00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:37,379
doing productive things with it and in

00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:39,569
the end why did you open source it you

00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:42,509
open source it for people to use it and

00:30:39,569 --> 00:30:46,019
to have the the freedom to use it and

00:30:42,509 --> 00:30:48,059
the freedom to change it so you didn't

00:30:46,019 --> 00:30:50,549
open source it you of course open source

00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,309
it also because you wanted other people

00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:57,029
to work on it and maybe to get something

00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:59,459
back from them but as a matter of fact I

00:30:57,029 --> 00:31:01,979
think most open source developers are

00:30:59,459 --> 00:31:04,349
also open sourcing their source code

00:31:01,979 --> 00:31:06,929
because they are already receiving a lot

00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:08,519
from the community and there are a lot

00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:11,879
of individuals of course out there which

00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:15,629
are just consuming and not contributing

00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:17,879
which is a bad thing but I don't think

00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:21,989
that we can change the world in that

00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:23,909
regard pretty much overnight it would be

00:31:21,989 --> 00:31:25,619
good if more companies are giving back I

00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:29,009
think a big challenge for many companies

00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:31,259
is the ability to give back and that's

00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:34,769
not only in terms of missing legal

00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:37,259
entities to donate money to but in some

00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:40,049
ways maybe they don't want to donate

00:31:37,259 --> 00:31:44,039
money because they don't have enough

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:46,169
money to give back to the community with

00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:49,799
monetary things and then that's where

00:31:46,169 --> 00:31:52,619
the the ability to contribute gets

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,559
harder because unless you are a software

00:31:52,619 --> 00:32:00,419
company you can basically not give back

00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:03,779
in any other form than giving money to

00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:07,019
someone or some entity or maybe

00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:11,519
advertising the use of open source and

00:32:07,019 --> 00:32:14,759
that's most likely the easiest way when

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,039
it comes to companies selling open

00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:20,339
source software and not contributing

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,189
back there are licenses for that that

00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:28,129
can help you with that at least to a

00:32:23,189 --> 00:32:32,699
certain degree and as long as someone is

00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:34,800
at least and if someone is providing

00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:37,620
support for some open so

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,200
earth component and in that way selling

00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:43,410
open source I'm pretty sure he is giving

00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:47,850
back because he will at least educate

00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:51,210
people about that he will if he needs to

00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:54,270
fix things and in most cases he will fix

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,220
it upstream maybe not for the reason

00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:58,320
that he wants to give back to the

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,540
community but at least for the reason if

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,940
he installs the software at his next

00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:05,520
customer the fix is already in and the

00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:13,290
fix is also in in a newer version so he

00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:14,820
doesn't have to handle it twice after

00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:16,590
all if there is a million people using

00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,360
it and a hundred people contributing

00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:19,860
still have a hundred people contributing

00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:22,890
yeah they are by an efficiency that is

00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:25,860
unmatched by anything else yeah and i

00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:28,080
think that's that's the main point about

00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:31,560
it i mean yeah many people are using it

00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,720
very few are giving back specifically in

00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:36,780
the enterprise a lot of companies are

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,080
building on top of open source software

00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:42,930
i'm making money because they have some

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,760
open source software underneath it being

00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:48,140
at the operating system or some other

00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,400
open source components and they are

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:54,900
unfortunately not really giving back

00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:58,800
much but we need to live with it or we

00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:02,210
need to go routes which we actually

00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,970
don't want to by using licenses that

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:08,880
really enforce things like that and that

00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:10,919
would also be a bad thing for open

00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:20,520
source in general at least from my point

00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:22,230
of view so i'm still managing we get the

00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,050
last eight minutes filled until Derek's

00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:28,380
will start good and I don't need to

00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:30,210
dance just very interesting inside of

00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:33,810
the never had open source is the

00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:35,820
business model of spammers we send out a

00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:42,600
million and we are happier to get 100

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:44,669
back pretty pretty much open source

00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,830
relies on the model of spammers I sent

00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:47,429
out 1,000,000 mail so if I get one back

00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:51,329
I'm

00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:53,849
happy yeah you could you could summarize

00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:56,609
it it's interesting interesting insight

00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:59,309
I never thought of it that way but

00:34:56,609 --> 00:35:01,980
that's good i guess i will use that in

00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:05,220
my next talk about such a topic i will

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,589
talk about nigerian spammers and how

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,780
they influence open source or how open

00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:12,750
source influence nigerian spammers but

00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,670
they are actually good business usage of

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:17,339
open source because most of them are

00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:20,960
using open source software to achieve

00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:23,790
their goal and at least in some weird

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,880
part of my hat you could consider that a

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:31,770
business model and a business any other

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:41,609
questions interesting insights into

00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:45,839
spammers and open source ok what do you

00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:48,990
recommend to pair commercial products

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:54,210
for a collaboration like exchange what

00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:58,740
would you recommend to use a source

00:35:54,210 --> 00:36:02,609
project that's that's a very tough one

00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:06,960
but the best option as robert just said

00:36:02,609 --> 00:36:13,020
would be caught up as a real group where

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:16,109
solution it is not one on one feature

00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,450
wise a migration path for exchange but

00:36:16,109 --> 00:36:20,430
it allows for the most parts that

00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,160
actually are used from exchange because

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:26,430
I've never actually seen someone really

00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:28,920
using exchange to its full extent which

00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:30,809
is also an interesting thing that the

00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,670
proprietary software typically is so

00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:34,710
overloaded with functionality that you

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,109
don't use everything that is in there

00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,270
but it got developed because someone

00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:41,099
threw money at the company to get it and

00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,640
typically in the open source world you

00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:46,880
get it extra tool for that he's

00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:52,759
collaborated for a raise and

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:55,940
device um they have some push stuff in

00:36:52,759 --> 00:36:57,710
there and I would consider it ready for

00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,309
enterprises and there is actually a

00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:03,319
company that is behind many parts of the

00:37:01,309 --> 00:37:05,329
development of Kolob and that is also

00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:12,170
offering enterprise support for coal up

00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:15,500
so yeah yeah so and there is a way to

00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:19,279
give back by buying it or by buying

00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:30,410
support from them so that's the solution

00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:38,900
for exchange anything else durex do you

00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:41,180
want to ask a question okay so which one

00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:44,720
do you want to answer an enterprise is

00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:47,059
giving back to open source software what

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,369
open source software components are used

00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:51,230
in the enterprise oh you have your own

00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:54,490
question okay i'm sorry i didn't know

00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:57,019
that you got your own questions with you

00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:59,180
so to fill the last gap those are the

00:37:57,019 --> 00:38:01,160
picture credits thanks to Creative

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,680
Commons I didn't write it on my slides

00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:06,109
but Creative Commons really rocks I

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:09,109
tried a new and different format for

00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:12,109
this session less content on my slides

00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:14,059
then typically and completely different

00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:16,430
slides I hope it at least somehow worked

00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:20,299
although I didn't manage to fill up the

00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:22,339
time once again i think i should just

00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:26,509
lower my expectations in terms of time

00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:28,009
i'm talking and propose shorter sessions

00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:32,539
i hope you enjoyed it if you have any

00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:34,819
more questions feel free to ask and with

00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:37,250
this i would like to gladly hand over

00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:39,789
the stage two dogs for his age a proxy

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,789
