Title: osc14: Robert Schweikert, Live Project Meeting
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Following the tradition of previous openSUSE Conferences we will once again have a face to face project meeting. It is always fun to have the meeting at the conference as being able to just speak instead of typing things into IRC makes things even more immediate.

Agenda items should be posted to the project meeting wiki and we will once again try to have a live IRC feed going to allow those not able to attend oSC to participate in the project meeting.
