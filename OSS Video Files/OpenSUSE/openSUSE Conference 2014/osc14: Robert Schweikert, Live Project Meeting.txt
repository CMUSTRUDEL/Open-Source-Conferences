Title: osc14: Robert Schweikert, Live Project Meeting
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Following the tradition of previous openSUSE Conferences we will once again have a face to face project meeting. It is always fun to have the meeting at the conference as being able to just speak instead of typing things into IRC makes things even more immediate.

Agenda items should be posted to the project meeting wiki and we will once again try to have a live IRC feed going to allow those not able to attend oSC to participate in the project meeting.

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
irc

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,040
papa open susa dash project

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,040
so we can if anybody's awake

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
the rest of the world they can ask us

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,920
questions and

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
we are live getting broadcast on

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,840
bamboozer

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,440
and we are live here so with that let's

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
get started with the project meeting we

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,480
don't really have an agenda

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,840
and i think the el presidente mr cloud

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,239
maybe has a few words to say to get

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,760
started

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,519
i actually don't have any what to say uh

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,400
we love to put you on the spot you know

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,040
that yeah well

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,439
um okay come to my talk this afternoon

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,319
at

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,799
2 p.m it's going to be about open stack

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,200
yeah streamless advertising

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,239
um so it's it's always good to have a

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,680
face-to-face meeting

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,400
uh for for the town hall as you know we

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,840
have the

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:18,239
bi-weekly meetings on iec um

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,280
and by the way don't forget to join for

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,880
the bi-weekly

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,320
meetings on ic because we'd like to have

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,000
more people participate

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,479
but having face-to-face discussion is

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
always uh very productive

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,919
and i think it's a good opportunity to

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
ask a lot of questions

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,759
uh if you want to raise anything uh

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,520
you'd like

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,600
i know there are some topics that would

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,639
like to discuss for example the

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,880
the release schedule and so on um

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,240
but it's really the place where you

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,360
should raise

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,080
uh anything that is important to you and

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,639
uh the board obviously will try to

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
answer

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,280
but everybody else here and hopefully

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,880
also in ic should also

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,560
participate and answer the questions

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,639
it's not just

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,280
you and us it's all of us together

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,520
so yeah i guess that's it you want to

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,440
say something or job

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,560
oh yeah well if you have any questions

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
if you don't have any question we're

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,800
done

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
no okay who starts

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,840
oh we should probably give the

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,840
microphone back

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
i don't have any questions

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:43,120
no no no no no no no

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,120
see yeah

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,160
so um i know very little about the

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,360
project i'm afraid but i'm eager to

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,720
learn more

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
and one of the things that i'm wondering

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,039
about is what's the relationship

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,039
between opensuse and the sleeve variants

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
yes

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,880
okay um so there was actually a session

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,960
about that

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,039
it was big on the schedule and was even

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,520
announced by costas um

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,280
in the opening keynote so you should

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,520
have gone there

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,080
but anyway so the simple and quick

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,919
answer is opensuse is the upstream for

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,280
suse linux enterprise

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,360
so we base our enterprise products on

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,199
some version of opensuse and every

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,280
development that we do

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,280
in terms of features specifically for

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,080
switzerland's enterprise

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,680
first or at least latest when it hits

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,440
suse links enterprise

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,639
also shows up in opensuse so it's our

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,919
test bed our development platform our

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,800
upstream project

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,840
that basically all suse employees

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,599
contribute to

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
and that we use as a base for our

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,240
product and more would be in my session

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,000
or we can do this

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,599
in a personal conversation one-on-one

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,960
because i don't want to steal one hour

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,800
of the boards

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,479
project meeting time

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
yeah that could be done in five minutes

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,840
i guess

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,840
i'm sorry so um

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,280
i know from well this sounds very

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,840
similar to the fedora

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,919
like uh how fedora's organized right

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,800
with the rawhide or fedora itself

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,720
being the testbed for the real products

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,759
not officially though and the fedora

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,720
people are

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,240
at least from what i know they try to

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,080
hide that fact

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,000
in fact they claim welfador is a

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,879
community product and all and

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,039
you know rather influence is negligible

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,800
and the community

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,639
well tries to hide that right how is

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,599
that in for the open source project is

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,960
there like a really

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:10,160
clear relationship as jan said

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,560
with the upstream uh it's as simple as

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
that

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,240
if we we've got no

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,319
no concerns over being an upstream

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,599
project just like gnome's an upstream

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,960
project for

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,000
desktop environment um it's

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,479
that simple we

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,199
we try we have our own releases which

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,599
are stable

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,320
etc we're looking at the development

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,680
model with

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,800
factory being a stable platform for

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,159
developers uh regular users who aren't

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,800
concerned about having the latest and

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,680
greatest

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:50,480
etc can use the the standard releases

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:54,160
but what goes into open souza

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,200
the sleep product has the option

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,399
of taking the best bits if they wish if

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,120
they don't want some of the

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
features that we have in open souza and

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,920
they develop

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,399
their own they can then submit them

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
they will submit them back upstream for

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,040
hopeful inclusion within open season

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,399
it's we have nothing to hide right i

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,560
mean there's nothing to hide and

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,560
and i mean this year we didn't but last

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,000
year we had statistics and the

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,360
statistics also were

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,200
available on the web

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,680
the contributions to opensuse

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
from community members they don't also

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,480
happen to work for souza

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,360
is significantly larger than those from

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,760
susa people so it is a community project

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,760
just based on the contributions

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,720
and as andrew said

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,160
a good example uh opensuse default

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,440
desktop kde

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,240
sli is gnome and it's been like that for

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
quite a while

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,680
so you know we stand on our own as a

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,000
community

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
and the seuss employees are just part of

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
that community

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,480
and just because jesus employees if they

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,640
try to do something that

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,839
people don't want then it doesn't go

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,440
anywhere

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,399
so there's no you know there's nothing

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:13,200
to hide and

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,360
and we are also a community project

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,680
meaning we're not just a distribution

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,399
because you only talk about sleep but

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,200
open source is

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,000
not just the open source distribution we

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,680
are

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,920
many more things than the distribution

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,160
we have obs for example

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,200
which yes it's based on suse people

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,360
mostly but

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
there are a lot of volunteers we are

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,839
also doing things like

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,560
producing i don't know debian and fedora

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,200
packages

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,040
which is not related to the distribution

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,760
but related to the project because

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,440
as a pro there are people that are

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
inside the open source project but don't

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,839
use open

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,079
source as a distribution they use debian

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,640
or making packages for fedora or

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,839
gen 2 or whatever you know i'm writing

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,800
on them do so

00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:02,079
it's it's not fair to converse less

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,440
we slay with uh open source because open

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,800
source it's much more than the

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,920
distribution for a desktop you know

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:13,519
and we are really proud because

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,560
even though suse is sponsoring us

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,279
we have in we have we are independent of

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,120
doing things

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,120
our way and nowadays this is very clear

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,360
with the latest things that happen it's

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,360
very clear that

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,959
even though they sponsor us they give us

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,360
great freedom of doing

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,320
whatever we whatever the community

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,760
thinks right

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,680
to be done so and

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,120
it it but it is a two-way street as well

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,640
which is yeah i can give you a really i

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,760
can give you a nice concrete example of

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
one that's just happened over the last

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,320
couple of months

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,160
um where you know i work on the

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,079
maintenance you guys had you know 312

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
coming out at the same time there's a

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,320
new version of slee on the way

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,680
so if and that was being based on what

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,720
we were committing to open sousa

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,959
so if we had included 312

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,560
as quickly as we possibly could have

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,920
that would have actually

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,920
made things a lot more complicated for

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,160
our friends who were constantly

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
so just talking with them we figured out

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,639
a way where

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,320
we were committing to factory we kind of

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,440
held back and left 310 in there for a

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
little bit longer than we would have

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,800
planned

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,200
we did our stuff elsewhere in obs so you

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,839
know

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,120
it it really is sort of a nice proper

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,680
community effort from sort of

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,279
all sites how you look at it you know we

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,600
will you know we'll make accommodations

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,680
to make things easier for susie

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:39,839
and yet we still get to do everything

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:39,839
crazy that we want to do

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,880
do you have any other derivative

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,279
distributions apart from

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,720
sleds is that it does anybody else try

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,839
and use your stuff as a base

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,519
um there are

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,360
um so one of the

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,959
projects that susan started with scissor

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,920
studio

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,040
which is effectively a an online tool

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,040
for

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,440
building custom

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,160
distributions or it was more focused at

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,680
appliances

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079
but there are several projects on there

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,880
now

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:29,440
that use studio exclusively

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:33,760
but with a very narrow focus

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:38,720
some of them are quantum physics that

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:41,040
things of that ilk that aren't really

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,839
going to be taken up by a the wider

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,079
community

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,320
but they have a very small niche that

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:50,320
they're quite happy in

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:53,920
so in theory yes

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,480
practice there's not a linux mint if you

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,440
will

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,320
or something along those lines there was

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,000
an effort

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,760
um a while back

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,639
to have a a full-on derivative

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,279
and i think that's quite down somewhat

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,639
due to

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,120
workloads etc of people involved

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,800
so there's no real derivative but you

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,399
can go on to studio and you will find a

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,760
whole heap of

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,760
niche um variants if you will

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,279
what fraction of your seven thousand

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,920
packages end up in a in

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:33,440
the slash server enterprise district

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,600
jan can correct me if i'm wrong but it's

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,440
around about two and a half

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:45,839
thousand yeah about two and a half

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,839
thousand packages out of seven thousand

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,959
on a wiki page that none of us here knew

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,959
about

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,480
oh all right okay so there's a question

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,800
on irc and ivan's asking

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,800
is there any plans for some lts editions

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,839
well we already have an lts edition with

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,720
evergreen so the evergreen project is a

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,079
community project

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,639
to give long term supports so

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,760
patches for specific versions of the

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,560
distribution the

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,120
latest version being thirteen one five

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,079
years

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,079
five years thank you

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,839
oh the question is now five years um i

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
can't remember how long ever green is

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,560
because i think

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,800
two more years after the sub after the

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,000
18 month support that we give

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,839
okay so it's three and a half years

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,839
rather than the usual 18 months

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,680
yeah but yeah anyone is free to join and

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,040
make this

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,360
for most more time

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,519
yeah so uh on the on on our wiki if you

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,279
if you look for the the evergreen page

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,880
i'm sure those guys have an email

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,480
address or mailing list that you can

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,399
get involved and help with because i

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,320
know they need it and

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,480
from what i heard from what i read in

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
the mailing list there are some packages

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
from older

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,880
distributions that are still being

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,959
maintained maintained because some

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,360
people just don't want to throw their

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,880
servers or change their server so

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,040
it it's at some points it goes

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,000
further than three and a half years or

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,800
however that

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,639
is some secure i think they make some

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,199
security

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,079
yeah i mean the point is that you know

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,320
we don't

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,160
plan the stuff from you know from a

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,320
board level this just happens

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
evergreen just happened there's a group

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,759
of

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,120
uh opensuse users that decided they

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,759
wanted a longer

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,880
cycle of security releases and security

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
patches

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,560
and they decided to create evergreen so

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,120
there was no plan

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,120
there was no oh we should do this and

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,240
you are the chosen ones to do that

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
this is not how our project works

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,920
uh you know we don't have a technical

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,720
steering committee

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,000
that's on purpose we want things like

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,679
that to just happen so

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,120
if you want to have a five-year opensuse

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:14,559
distribution with security patches

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,079
start it join the factory list join the

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,240
project list

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,400
gather a couple people generally this is

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
really easy in the opens who's a build

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,039
service

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,360
okay we have all the tools that are

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,280
there it only takes effort from whoever

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,400
is interested to do it

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,000
and you know none of us that sit up here

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,000
and happen to be elected on the

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,919
board nor you know the guys that

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,320
put together factory and do all the

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,320
maintenance there are going to stop you

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,080
so you know this is an open project

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,480
everybody who is willing to put in the

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,280
effort

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,320
and the work and share their work you're

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,480
welcome to do it

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,919
so if you know if evergreen is not long

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
enough

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,360
more power to you you know do it i mean

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,480
you know we have people that are

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,400
um interested enough to trying to keep

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,400
kde 3 alive in the open source build

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,280
service and it's becoming increasingly

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,919
harder because

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
upstream is no longer maintained but

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,000
they're doing it right

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,039
and um so that just shows you the

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,679
freedom

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,360
that people have within the project and

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
the opportunities that they have by

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,240
using the tools like the open source

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
bill service which is really great

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,840
i hope that answers the question

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
anything else

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:39,200
one question i have is what do

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,320
people feel the focus is

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,919
or focus should be for

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,280
opensuse as a distribution

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:53,200
is it focused on

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,280
end users focused on

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,240
desktop developers focused on web

00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,320
developers

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,960
or developers in general bleeding edge

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,600
what do i'm interested to find out what

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,720
people

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
think the focus should be and what they

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,840
feel the focus

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,840
is now

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,360
if you don't feel that there is a focus

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,559
then

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,520
by all means you know you can air that

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,160
and

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,799
you may be right i i'm not trying to

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,679
guide and put words in your mouth i'm

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,919
interested to

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
get feedback to understand what people

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,760
think

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,080
and why they think that but is there

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,360
really a need for a focus for open souza

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
i mean um if we look at what robert just

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,520
said with

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,280
lts if you want to have a little bit

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,960
more of evergreen if evergreen's not

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,480
enough go ahead and do it i mean the

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,039
community is about people

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,640
who do stuff if you want to have open

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,440
souza to focus on

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,960
desktop developers then go ahead and

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,520
create an environment and

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
build a team of community members who

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,640
think alike

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,080
to focus that and maybe even create a

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,400
derivative like

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,440
open source education which adds

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,919
education

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
focused topic packages on top of the

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,679
open souza distribution

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,600
but if we are a community project that

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,799
should be welcoming to everyone

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:26,320
if we really set a focus area or focus

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,600
for the distribution um don't we exclude

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,679
people

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,600
i mean if i'm not a desktop developer

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,919
and the open source project tells me

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,600
like

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,960
we are focusing our distribution on

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:38,240
desktop developers

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,679
um then it seems that the open source

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,120
community and the open source

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,600
distribution is not the right choice for

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,679
me

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,200
and i have the feeling that with tools

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,679
like obs we have

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,600
the possibility to create any

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,080
distribution we like and we can

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,200
mix and match packages from the ob from

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,320
the open build service

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,400
into opensuse to create what i want to

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,159
use opensuse for and i think that's

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,720
the really good thing about opensuse

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,159
that we are not focused on

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,720
one specific use case

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,720
while i

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,720
do partially agree with that that

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:19,039
having not having a focused target

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,720
means that we are as inclusive as

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,159
possible

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,919
as with anything if you're doing

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,919
something without focus

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:31,360
it's never going to be as good um yeah i

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,120
would disagree

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,039
when i joined the project one of the

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,840
greatest things that i found out was

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,640
that

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:41,120
i could have the same system as admin

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,640
but he had more

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:47,919
repositories included but

00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,919
when i had a problem i could easily

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,400
guide him because i'm a net user and i'm

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,039
not a developer or something so

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
what i want to say in technical terms is

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,880
a bit

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,120
you have to read between the lines in

00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,520
order to understand me so it was amazing

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,159
that

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,440
i could do that also for i have some

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,080
developer friends

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,880
and what i got from them is that it's

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,880
really nice

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,080
that they can actually understand they

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,120
like open source because they can

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,000
actually understand

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,760
end users that have problems like we

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,480
cannot actually

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,159
say what the problem is i say we find

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,000
something and this blips and i don't

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,159
know what to do you know

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,200
what do you do it's it's like a life bug

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,559
report and

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,080
it's amazing that someone very technical

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,159
can share the same desktop the same

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,159
distribution with someone else and be

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,679
able to interact each other and

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,159
actually bring results and making users

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,960
life

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,919
better if there is either this is an end

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,880
user either

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,000
either this is a sysadmin or whatever i

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,880
mean just has

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,679
millions of modules that people can do

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
amazing things

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,600
with that yeah if you look at some of

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,200
our

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:03,039
peer distributions they've managed to go

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,720
they've managed to grow their reach

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,640
because for instance they

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
focus somewhat on for instance

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,559
developers

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,760
then you get users of a specific

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,600
application

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,520
that they've tested and they've tried

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,640
and think oh this is great

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,559
and that they then look at what that

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,400
developer has used is the just

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,120
distribution for development

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,320
they go well i need to use that distro

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,799
because

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,840
the developer used it so it must be good

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,679
and it must work great

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,880
i probably agree to that part but i

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
don't think that

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,159
opensuse as a project is really missing

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
focus because

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,559
we got it you should go away from that

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,440
speaker

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,840
we got different teams that are focusing

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
on

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,919
different things i mean there's the

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,520
gnome team which i'm sure has the

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:59,039
goal to deliver the best and most stable

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:01,760
gnome and most latest gnome

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,559
for opensuse there is the kde team which

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,520
i'm sure have

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,799
exactly the same thing we have community

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:10,159
members who are working on

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,679
subscribers for creating

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:17,039
publishing material

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,679
we have in obs we have

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,679
development tools projects where you can

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,720
get the latest python the latest

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,600
perl and so on so i think

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,200
we have a lot of choice we are not in

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,679
the position that we need to

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,880
that we need to focus on a specific area

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,000
but you can really

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,600
build what you want opensuse to be with

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,080
obs if i look at my

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:45,360
system then i have around 13 to 14

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,240
different obs projects in my repository

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
list because

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,600
i want the latest python packages on my

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,760
system

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,960
i'm looking for the latest libreoffice

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,159
packages because i

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,520
want to have the latest stable of that

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,640
so i don't really get why we

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,240
should enforce ourselves into a position

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,320
that we are focusing on end users or we

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:12,000
are focusing on desktop developers

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,080
and by the way if you want to do this

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,840
how do you want to achieve it if what

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,320
robert says is true that the board

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,320
can't point into any direction

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,840
and we are not like any other so

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,559
it took me three years to understand

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,880
that

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,720
well as for your last point it's

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,039
probably not a matter of enforcing but

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,640
soft massaging into that direction

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,400
with pouring especially with pouring

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
mono money over things

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
if you wanted to focus i think the rapid

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,480
developer example was good if you

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,559
wanted to be a web development platform

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,960
whatever then you would probably want to

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,080
be compatible with the latest opera

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
release say

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,840
yeah that would not be a focus of say

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,360
other distributions because they would

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,880
not care about proprietary software

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,080
right working by default

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,559
or you would care for firefox 0.8

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,159
because

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,000
you know your web developers might have

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,880
the need of being compatible with legacy

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,320
applications

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:10,400
but yet opensuse does not even ship gtk1

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,559
i guess which which might not even have

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,440
to be used by firefox 8.8 i don't know

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,880
but um the point is opensuse does not

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,480
care for legacy right

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,640
so there is no

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,080
while there is there's the absence of

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,600
focus if you focus there

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,360
then you would need to actually develop

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,600
into that direction by for example

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,039
pouring money money over that and if you

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,240
say well there's no need for focus then

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:39,840
let me ask you

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,840
is there a need for open suse then

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,400
i think if you want to sell something

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,799
it's maybe

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,600
that we tell people more of it they're

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,240
not just getting a distribution they get

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,880
a tool chain around it open qa is the

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,320
build services we can if we can

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,919
a lot of times if i show people the

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,120
build service and they have some basic

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,520
understanding of packaging

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,200
that's like aha moments it's not like

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,000
i'm just getting a distribution rather

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
than have to do

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,279
everything manually on top i get a

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,080
framework

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,840
which is integrated into our

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,200
distribution somewhat could be better

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,120
maybe

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,880
but i think vets could be a selling

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,520
point

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
and if you cater to developers that's a

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
big one

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,520
so i personally would be more for some

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,559
focus or

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,399
areas of focus but in on the other hand

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,240
we are focusing on variety

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,240
because we make it easy to package

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,200
things we are make it easy to

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,600
build a repo for a certain project like

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,520
desktop environment is there which is

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,520
well maintained and i think this is a

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,679
good thing on the other hand

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,960
i think there are some areas which could

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,159
be improved maybe

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,640
some kind of usability for new users

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:11,120
to find what um what they can use

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,279
and also documentation is lacking so

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,440
maybe just make it a year

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,360
or the year of documentation or year of

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,000
usability whatever

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,640
it doesn't have to be a focus like 10

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
years

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,919
because no one can look into the future

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,960
and

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,600
project so much so i think

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,960
to think about more areas of focus not

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,200
only one focus

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,320
because currently the focus is very

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,559
variety and i think it's great

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,559
okay

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:49,120
so just to answer the

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:53,679
rc uh comment about uh

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:56,720
my question from manu um

00:28:53,679 --> 00:29:00,240
it's like i say it it's an open

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,440
question to to everyone to to air their

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,480
feelings so if

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,480
you don't feel that we do need focus on

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,520
any specific point then

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,480
great i'm just trying to get some

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,360
feedback

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
from the community to understand the

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,840
current

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:21,200
mindset that's going around

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,520
at my work it's

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,440
i see a lot of different viewpoints from

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,000
different distributions on their

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,120
targets usage etc so i'm just curious as

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,200
to

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,880
you know the community that i'm involved

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,360
in what their

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,360
thoughts are

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,240
hello on this topic i would say

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,240
that

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,039
there's a great infrastructure in open

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,240
source

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,240
all the tools all the build services and

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,080
so on

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,520
and i think that not a lot of people

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,159
know that really

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,080
and maybe one focus should be to promote

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:06,320
that

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:09,360
so maybe it shouldn't be about

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,240
focusing on a desktop user or a web

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,000
development or

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,760
something like that but maybe just

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,039
finding focus on

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,919
which direction in what stuff that you

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,520
have that is specific to open source

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,640
that you should promote

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,840
and also uh i would say that

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,120
just is a great thing and i also don't

00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,720
think that

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:36,880
a lot of people know about it

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,640
yast is quite a

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,399
polar and quite a divisive

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,840
uh tool uh i know

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,039
quite a few people that they've used

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,600
you know souza or susan the past and

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,600
as much as they liked it they were put

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,960
off by us

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,159
um my response to them is well you don't

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,640
have to use it

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,320
if you like using your config files and

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,919
you have specific scripts for

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:11,679
configuration whatever else do that

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,840
um there are alternative

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
gui's to configuration that you can

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,679
install

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:23,600
instead of using yast it's not mandatory

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:27,200
but back to your first point of

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,720
raising awareness etc yeah that's

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,440
unfortunately an issue that we've had

00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,399
for quite some time and we've never

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,760
really

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,440
in my viewpoint we've never really

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,720
worked out

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,840
how we should do that

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,840
so ideas

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,840
most welcome

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:58,720
hi as an old developer

00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:02,159
unix developer i can say that i was

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,960
it works for me developer 15 years ago

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,799
now it's not so it's nice that you ask

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,480
people what you want to be

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:14,080
opensuse as developer

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,960
i would like to have nice distribution

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,159
which already have everything inside and

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,880
all of us knows that

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,000
it's impossible definitely impossible so

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,799
i think

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,279
that you should create product which is

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,000
nice

00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,120
for end users not for us developers

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,080
because i think that

00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,200
developer must know what he is doing on

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:37,200
that system

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,760
if he don't know anything about linux or

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,039
windows or anything how he can be a

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,000
developer

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,559
so for developers yes you can have chain

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,159
tools

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:52,399
like ming w or etc etc packages

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,720
but i don't see any reason to go in

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,159
there

00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,120
in many directions with distribution

00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,679
so you have to you must have stable

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,799
noise

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,120
and good distribution for end users

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,919
so that's the only way how how can you

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,320
attract them

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,000
to use it and there there is a point

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,880
that just is amazing it's an amazing

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
tool yes

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,399
if you are a rookie and you don't want

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,840
to learn anything you just

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:21,279
want to set up a system that runs as all

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,480
windows users last time last time when i

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,960
installed open source in my virtualbox

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,200
just crashes so okay i made my config

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,000
files by hands by vi

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,760
but that's that are things which which

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,440
must work perfect

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,120
perfect perfect for end users not for me

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,880
yeah i'm talking as a net user i always

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,120
can write it it works for me

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,200
because i will find a way how to set

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,880
something set up something

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:52,720
so as as a developer sorry cooler

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:56,559
as a developer do you think we should

00:33:52,720 --> 00:34:00,240
look at having

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:03,600
an sdk release if you will so

00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:06,399
an open suse release with the

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,159
develop projects for the different

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:13,200
languages etc enabled by default so that

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,480
a developer can do that install

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,480
and if they need a specific

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,960
language whatever else it's a simple i'm

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,159
core developer of lazarus project

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,839
that's multi-platform rad

00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,079
eja i mean it's copy of delphi on linux

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,399
on windows on mac it works so i create

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,599
my binaries on one machine on linux

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:37,679
native binaries and i push it

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,280
so that means i can install my tool

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,000
anywhere if you want to attract

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,720
developers

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,679
okay you must have people who will

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,399
maintain

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,560
development packages and it's very

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,399
important i'm using fedora at the moment

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,960
because they push the cross-compiling

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,760
tools

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,720
in their distribution and they maintain

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,000
that

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:01,760
so that's the point you can you can

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,960
develop on linux in vi

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:09,599
and compile it definitely

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:13,280
don't just move away for example gtk1

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,720
it's still used it's still

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,359
used believe me it is so

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:20,800
developers are one world and end users

00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,800
again

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,800
are another world when they install

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,760
distribution they want it to work

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,680
out of the box so i think the focus must

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,160
be on stability

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,520
and hardware support you have yes tool

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,960
which is pretty nice

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,760
for end users so i think that

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,720
focus should be on distribution which is

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,880
stable

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,359
and which works thanks that's all um

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,200
thanks i mean the thing is you know as

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,720
developers we're also end users

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,880
right yeah you develop and you know how

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,839
to set up your development environment

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,359
but if everything around you falls apart

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:00,480
you're not going to be happy with that

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,079
either right

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:07,760
so the end user and developer

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:11,359
part is that distinction is very fussy

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,160
and you know the term the end user is an

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,000
unquantifiable animal right because well

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,599
there are end users that love kde and

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,560
the end users that love gnome and the

00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,720
end users that

00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,079
love something else and i think in the

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,320
end

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:25,119
if you look at what we have in opensuse

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,880
with

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,280
five integrated desktops and i think

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,520
they all work pretty well

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,400
uh i think we're you know we're catering

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,040
to a large

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,359
community of end users that you know we

00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,520
may not advertise enough

00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:41,200
but i think we're a step ahead of other

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,920
distributions in that area

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,359
and cool had something to add or

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,079
different changing topic

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,079
so go ahead

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,839
bless you

00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,960
i actually can't hear the terms

00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,920
developer and users in this context at

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,160
all because this just as you just said

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,680
it's

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,200
basically everyone needs everything and

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,040
no matter who asks for focus if the

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,880
discussion continues just a bit longer

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,359
than the first 10 minutes you will

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,359
figure that he needs everything else too

00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:22,720
like i'm a web developer i just need web

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,480
tools uh and the browser

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,560
and the editor and the kernel oh a

00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,599
bootloader too i just agree of course i

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,720
need zumba shares

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
and uh yeah gnome okay norm2 oh my wife

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,880
needs kde

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,359
and she plays games okay then yeah okay

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,440
then

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,440
make it everything but focus

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,960
well as uh and i see sf just said

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,079
focus should be stability and i think

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,079
the the

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:57,359
changes being made with factory uh etc

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,880
should hopefully address that issue

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,800
and and that's one reason why i ask the

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,200
question is you know

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,000
some people have a specific viewpoint

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,119
and there may not

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,560
be as knowledgeable about

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,520
the bigger picture um whereas as release

00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,160
manager you

00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,040
get to see all sorts of crazy nonsense

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,119
so you

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,400
slightly more in tune with what is

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,839
actually required

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,880
um but focusing on stability

00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,640
i see that is obviously a sensible thing

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,040
i mean you look at debian debian's quite

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,040
stable

00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,280
i mean sorry but with the whole focus on

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,640
are we focusing on instability i mean

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,320
you know we don't exactly want a distro

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:45,920
that crashes

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:46,320
isn't it kind of implying who you ask

00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,359
the

00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:52,720
the focus on stability is really

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,480
something that you put on presentations

00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,000
but i don't know who said it but i think

00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,440
it's still true that fixing a bug

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,800
doesn't got you late

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:04,240
so you need something fresh

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:06,640
and i mean yeah you can say yeah

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,800
the new release came out two years and

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,160
we fixed 900 bucks

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,960
unfortunately not the one you are

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,079
interested in but 900 other bucks

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,760
and we did not implement any features

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,520
because we wanted to implement

00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,040
focus on stability so the feature you

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,000
wanted is still not in

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,800
but we fixed 900 different bugs so it's

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,040
kind of not

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,960
really a selling point you can you can

00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,640
talk about it but

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,880
it's there's a reason why debian has so

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,560
many derivatives because

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,560
debian concentrates on stability

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,160
yeah but the the users are actually

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,079
tested using tested or unstable or mint

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,520
or ubuntu or

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,480
what you can go on i i don't know anyone

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,640
who uses

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,480
who uses i mean they deploy it but they

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,839
don't use debian stable

00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,079
i don't know anyone perhaps there is one

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,880
there are a couple here so but now i

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,280
have to

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,640
i think we can you know go on with the

00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,319
focus discussion for

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,880
probably the rest of the day but there

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,079
was also um a point on irc about the

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,640
release cycle

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,480
so maybe for the last uh 20 minutes that

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,760
we have maybe we can uh

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,760
switch that topic yeah okay

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,079
well yeah so yeah we had a question from

00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,599
sdf about the release cycle um

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,280
just to make sure everyone knows you

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,640
know unusual release cycle is eight

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,480
months

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,000
this year the next release is going to

00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,280
be in november so that's

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,520
12 months after the last release and

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,280
sort of the questions open to you know

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
what should our release cycle be should

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,839
it be

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,599
eight months from next november or

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,400
should it be 12 months or should it be

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:44,240
something else

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,599
and that's definitely one of the

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,720
questions sort of i wanted to ask the

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,480
room

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,920
to get everyone's feel of where should

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,880
the 13

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,079
3 release be and and maybe cooler should

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,079
give

00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,520
some background from a release

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,560
management perspective

00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,839
since he also had a very nice summary

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,599
when we had the discussion on the

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,440
mailing list about

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,280
summer releases and how that's difficult

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,720
and things like that so maybe cooler you

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,640
just want to say a few words to that

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,680
before we get into

00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,680
the rest of the discussion

00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:24,160
joey

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,880
yeah there are several aspects of

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,119
releasing

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,200
that are very hard to summarize in a

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,839
sentence

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,839
but the thing is that

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,800
eight months are very challenging

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,480
because they have one spot

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,720
that or they actually have two spots

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,720
where

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,240
that are challenging for the november

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,359
release

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,520
is is okay because you have the full

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,880
autumn to

00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,200
concentrate but the

00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,000
the spring release or the july release

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,040
that we have

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,040
right now is very

00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,640
challenging because there are so many

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,160
holidays and easter i mean not not in

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,319
every country but in

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,960
those countries we have our contributors

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,280
in the

00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,680
the spring is really full and people

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,760
start to go outside and don't fix bugs

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,720
and and additionally to that you can't

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,400
really delay the july release because as

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,680
we learned in the 11-2

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,720
there's a huge vacation spot

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,960
spot right after which is also also

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,520
a challenge for the whole marketing

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,240
because you usually release a market

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,880
market to marketing after the release

00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,000
but

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,119
if the journalists or the bloggers are

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,880
on vacation

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,119
or the readers of those blocks are on

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,400
vacation it does not really pay off

00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,280
doing marketing and

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,480
so actually from from the actual point

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
of releasing

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,000
it doesn't make sense to release just

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,520
once a year and find a good spot for

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,800
that

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,839
and the other thing is

00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,839
that having

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,400
in have no release for 12 months is a

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,400
huge challenge for

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,000
having a conference i mean now it's

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,280
april and the

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,319
31 is just six months away you still

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,760
remember it

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,680
but if this conference would be in

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,599
september it would be quite challenging

00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,160
to talk about

00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,640
13 1 because it's really old then by

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,760
then

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,440
in in terms of iphones

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,880
i mean this is really the world moved on

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,359
from uh it's okay to have everything

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,319
have have something only once every two

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:53,839
years

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,160
and yeah it's

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:58,000
it's challenging to find topics then all

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,200
the time to to talk about or

00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,400
to to to to keep to keep

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,560
people to remember opensuse distribution

00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,119
so that's that's why we think we thought

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,720
about

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,160
um having

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:20,720
factory more more in the focus

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,599
so that we as someone in irc mentioned

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,440
arc linux

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,760
so move to grab those that are really

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,359
in need of having something to talk

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,960
about and having

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:36,000
someone to to yeah to

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,760
to show the new stuff always something

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,319
something fresh because factory will be

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,720
released every two weeks

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,760
by by means of milestones that work and

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,240
tested and

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:51,760
are stable by by means of

00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,400
open qa and open um yeah generally test

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,720
it

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,960
and really have factory not as a test

00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,040
bed for something that will happen

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,720
somewhere but really release factory

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:07,839
daily really and mean it by by

00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,839
also having it release ready every day

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:16,240
that's basically our main idea

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:16,240
for the last couple of months

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,839
and we think once we're there we can

00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,040
move

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:25,440
the opensuse releases as we know them

00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,640
well as they used to be to a different

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:31,200
release cycle

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,680
so we use this cycle now to actually

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,880
work on changes and we would actually

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,480
have loved

00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,920
if more people contributed to that

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,000
effort unfortunately this does not

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,520
happen

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,640
to make factory really kicking ass daily

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,440
and once we're there we can talk about

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,079
releasing only two years or one year or

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,560
whatever

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,839
and then also talk about more once we

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,520
have less

00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,880
code streams we can also talk about

00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,000
longer

00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:03,040
release maintenance cycles but the the

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,760
number the the years of maintains

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:07,440
is is limited by the number of code

00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,079
streams you have to maintain this is

00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,800
something

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,800
that you have to realize also and

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:20,000
so i think the first step should be

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:20,880
to make to to split in the minds of

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,079
people

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:28,560
factory and opensuse releases

00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:32,560
and then make opensuse releases

00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:36,960
and boring and factory bleeding edge

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:39,280
and kicking so because i think

00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,880
there are two two groups of people i

00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,720
wouldn't call them developers and end

00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,079
users but there are two different

00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,920
groups of people in the open source

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,800
community and in the linux community in

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
general

00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,040
and i think we have to offer two

00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,319
different things to

00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:55,839
do these so

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:57,839
that's why i don't think we should

00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:01,599
discuss a release cycle

00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:05,040
for opensuse releases without also

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:06,240
splitting the opensuse releases into two

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:10,079
one question

00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,680
on that i i would really like to see

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,119
factory working like that but

00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,319
what about what's happening with

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,319
tumbleweed which is

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,640
partly the same thing you're talking

00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:24,319
about factory to become right

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:28,640
it's no it's not it's actually a very

00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:28,640
big misunderstanding of tumbleweed

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:34,160
the can you explain the difference

00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,160
between them

00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:41,839
so it someone called it

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,040
tumbleweed uh rolling release yes but

00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:45,599
unfortunately it's not

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,800
tamil weeds are rolling the tumbleweed

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:52,960
distribution is

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:56,000
only jumping so the

00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,440
tumbleweed in general is just

00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,599
i i greg can you see it it's i put it in

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,960
quotes uh it's really a lot of effort

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,280
but it's just an add-on

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,640
repository to the latest distribution so

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,640
you get the latest kernel it is

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,119
kitty gnome libreoffice whatever greg

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,680
puts in there with a lot of effort

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,599
on top of the latest release and once

00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,400
the new release comes out it jumps on

00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,280
that

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,240
so you still have the the bump between

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,680
the releases

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,640
that are people usually afraid of so

00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,200
and factory will not do that factory

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,760
will

00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,400
or is doing this for years already move

00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,319
on

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,079
from from one small step to another

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:36,800
small step so you have at one day

00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:39,359
you you get a new gnome the next day you

00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,640
get a new gcc and you need a glc

00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:46,160
and it's really moving in small steps

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:49,599
so out of my experience

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,160
once i i decided to use factory okay

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,720
i i'm a rookie user i'm not into

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,760
everything

00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,640
like that so after restarting my

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,359
computer for

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,440
a second time and making an update from

00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:04,559
factory i had my computer

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,119
christmas tree you know no computer i i

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:07,760
know i

00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:09,599
probably did something wrong right but

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,800
you know i was trying

00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:16,079
i think i was trying to build a

00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,119
lump or something like that and from

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,040
some upgrade

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:24,319
that my point is that is factory

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:27,280
dangerous to new users

00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,960
to use meaning that okay you have some

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:31,920
new user that wants to have

00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,720
the latest thing in the in to his uh

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:35,839
laptop

00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,520
or his pc and he says okay

00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,000
in that terms that you said that factory

00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,440
will work i will install factory

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,079
is that dangerous does

00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,720
do those dangers exist if someone

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,680
installs factory

00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,480
the thing is with even with the new

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,200
kernel

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,280
even if you don't exchange any other

00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,240
piece if you just update from the latest

00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,599
upstream kernel

00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,599
to the latest upstream currently latest

00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,200
upstream kernel there's always danger

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,800
that your machine will break

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,359
no matter what other component you

00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,920
touched the latest kernel might not work

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,599
on your

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,800
driver as simple as that

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,960
and so there will always be a danger

00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,319
no matter what release cycle no matter

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,800
what release way

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,160
your machine might break with an update

00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,880
and this happens with ubuntu this

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,800
happens with

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,559
fedora this happens with everything it's

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,760
just a matter of fact

00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:32,800
my point here is that maybe we should

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,920
probably use since you're doing all this

00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,800
do uh do that more obvious to people

00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,960
because

00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,720
i i had people around that were on

00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,119
factory in order to make back reports

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,800
and help however they could and

00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:49,200
they had that they believed

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,280
they believed that factory would be like

00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,800
what tumbleweed promised

00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:59,119
i i yes

00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:02,960
you can compare what's factory in 2013

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:06,400
with what it will be in 2014 because the

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:09,359
we put a lot more effort into

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:09,839
actually releasing only what works and

00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,920
that's

00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,920
that is the precondition of what i what

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,000
i meant so we have three steps

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,960
and we are already done with half of the

00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,319
first step that is first making factory

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:26,240
test it then make it

00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,960
uh promoted or split in in the mind of

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,599
people

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,800
factory from opensuse releases and then

00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,800
change the release cycles

00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,119
so there's also a question question on

00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,440
irc about

00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:42,319
um whether we get more stability with a

00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,480
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,160
month release cycle so i mean stability

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,839
is always

00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:50,480
questionable right as cooler said

00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,760
earlier there will always be somebody

00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:57,200
who will find a bug it is software

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,920
right just like linux supports

00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,800
more drivers than any other operating

00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,480
system

00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,640
but there will always be one or two

00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,119
users whose hardware is not working

00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,520
because

00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,240
that particular driver is missing so

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,760
does that mean

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,240
linux doesn't support enough drivers yes

00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,119
uh does one bug mean we're not stable

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,839
probably not

00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,880
right so the stability question i think

00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,760
is you know it's

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,800
it's loaded and it really can't answer

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,440
um

00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,839
as far as you know more newer packages i

00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,359
think

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,480
that you know stefan answered that

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:33,440
already with saying well once we get

00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:34,079
once we move forward with the new model

00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,160
uh

00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,800
you will have the opportunity to

00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,559
basically live on factory tested

00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,119
and then you get the latest and greatest

00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:45,280
if that's

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,200
where you want to live uh i think and

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,960
then even in the new model i think

00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:51,680
you know where i disagree is that i

00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:53,040
think there's still room for tumbleweed

00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,720
because tumbleweed is really a

00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:58,319
collection between

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,040
major releases of various repositories

00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,119
such as

00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:03,440
you know sometimes the latest gnome

00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:06,000
sometimes the latest libra office

00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,599
almost always the latest release kernel

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
so i think it's a collection and it

00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:10,559
would

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,760
maybe you know people like yan instead

00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,800
of having

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,119
20 repositories can you know maybe cut

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,200
i mean not you personally but you know

00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,960
in many cases for many people it works

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,680
out that well instead of adding 20

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,400
repositories such as gnome stable and

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:28,000
python and whatever else often it works

00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,079
for them to just switch to tumbleweed

00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,160
and get the latest stuff that the

00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,839
developers consider stable and basically

00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,079
ready for release so i think

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,040
there's still more leeway here and and

00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,720
more

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:42,559
facets to the thing but so i hope this

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,359
answers the question

00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,359
i haven't seen any other one that

00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:55,599
what yeah yeah you already answered

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:56,319
about the dangers of factory i think

00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,400
it's good

00:53:56,319 --> 00:54:00,319
it's like paragliding that's why i'm

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,160
working in open source

00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,760
you know when you live on the edge all

00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,760
the time

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,040
it's not for normal users do you read

00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,520
warranties in in

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,160
licenses nobody guarantees anything

00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,960
there

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:14,000
so i'm developer if i'm at factory at

00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,400
suse or i'm

00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,359
at rawhide at fedora i know what i'm

00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:21,040
doing

00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:24,079
and there is you can write there

00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:27,359
no warranty is that there is no warranty

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,359
your disk can be swiped and

00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:31,119
yes you should have seen the meters

00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:33,440
presentation i don't know if you did

00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:35,599
about linux teams and the people who are

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,880
inside universities and try to promote

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:42,640
open source linux free software

00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:46,559
the thing is that people

00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:50,480
think that they will take opensuse

00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:54,240
and do whatever is on their minds

00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,920
the truth is that if you study end users

00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,319
users that don't want to be experienced

00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,240
user want just to have a browser and

00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,839
you know go to facebook the thing is

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:04,480
that when they

00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:05,280
pass from a proprietary software to free

00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,000
software or

00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,400
into open source software they suddenly

00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,599
have more demands from their system

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,599
and that's you cannot teach them i think

00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:18,559
if they not have a will to do that

00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:18,960
i agree i agree with you so i'm just i'm

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,559
just

00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,440
yeah you're putting the elephant in the

00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:26,480
room again we are on two kind of users

00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:29,280
yes i mean i had a guy who tried to

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,240
set up a lamp when he installed the open

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,839
source

00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,920
and he told me oh i cannot do that

00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,400
because blah blah blah blah and i told

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,640
him

00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,839
have you ever tried to install something

00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,000
like that on windows and

00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:41,440
he said no but you said you told me that

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,720
i could do everything so

00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,680
you know yeah okay thank you so

00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,000
so we're slowly reaching the end um so

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,000
maybe

00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,640
mikhail wanted to say something earlier

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,720
um we're coming to a point where

00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,839
we will interfere with the next speakers

00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,520
and

00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:00,000
bruno would have the right to kick us

00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:02,319
out so let's let's try and avoid that

00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,760
yeah i had just a little comment of what

00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:07,520
was cool saying

00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:11,200
basically uh and what was costa's

00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:14,559
question actually uh factory was really

00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:17,359
bleeding back in the days nobody was

00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:19,839
well users were testing it but they

00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:21,520
usually run into some troubles and

00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:23,280
it happened to me a few times that i

00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:25,760
basically just throw

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,000
installation away and just started from

00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,880
scratch

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:32,000
with what we are doing and what we are

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,240
testing now

00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,040
we should avoid these uh kind of

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,160
problems

00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:39,680
and there still will be bugs there still

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,720
will be problems

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,520
but there shouldn't affect your ability

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:46,240
to

00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,040
start your machine this shouldn't affect

00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,799
your ability

00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,559
to update to the fixed version so

00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:55,359
yeah it might happen that your favorite

00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:58,799
program would crash and it wouldn't work

00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,359
for a week but you will be able to move

00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,240
on

00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:04,319
without throwing away everything that's

00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:07,520
what we are trying to achieve

00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,440
and that's what i really would like to

00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:12,240
have on my machine i don't mind if

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,799
if it breaks from time to time if i'm

00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,319
able to

00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:18,720
recover from that relatively easily

00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:20,400
okay great thanks so as i said we're

00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,119
close we're almost running out of time

00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:26,079
and bruno is itching to kick us out so

00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:28,160
uh anyway i think this is a good time to

00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:31,280
break thanks thanks for everybody to

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:41,200
participating we have

00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:45,119
okay one more from kulo

00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:47,119
um a final remark i hope

00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,240
that i hear it very often that this is a

00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,359
community project

00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:54,559
and this is not susa and this is blah

00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:56,480
um i would like everyone to remind that

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,760
this is only a community project if

00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,799
there are people helping beside me and

00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,079
my team

00:58:00,799 --> 00:58:04,079

00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:12,480

dubrovnik

00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,559
i am sure february and his team are

00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:35,280
doing a tremendous great job in making

00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:37,760
you all feel green inside

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:39,839
hopefully not on the outside

00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:41,599
unfortunately due to some nasty health

00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:43,520
issues i was unable to attend this

00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,319
conference and out of sheer annoyance

00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,400
therefore have

00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:48,480
offered to organize the next one in my

00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,480
hometown

00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,920
a person should have goals hopes and

00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:53,599
dreams right

00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,640
so next year's location will be the

00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,559
international city of peace and justice

00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,000
the hague in the netherlands it's a city

00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,319
known for its broad cultural

01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,880
influence which also pretty much means a

01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:07,040
great diversity in party locations

01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,599
which i'm sure we can show some of you

01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,280
