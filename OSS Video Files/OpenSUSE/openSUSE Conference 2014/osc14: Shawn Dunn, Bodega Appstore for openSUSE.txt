Title: osc14: Shawn Dunn, Bodega Appstore for openSUSE
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Bodega is an appstore developed by the Plasma-Active team within KDE. This talk will be an overview of Bodega, how it works, how and/or whether the openSUSE community would like something like this included in the distribution, as well as some demonstrations of how it works. Additionally, Bodega does offer "Store" Functionality, and this would be covered, as an informational/discussion topic, as it could potentially offer a revenue stream to openSUSE

no we're literally I came from food unto

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,450
I was the ke maintainer over there and

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,550
we came over to opensuse as part of the

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,309
clover leaf project where we were

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:17,789
intending to create an open Susa based

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,880
distribution and our developer support

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:23,250
kind of fell apart and we found a number

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,140
of the folks in opensuse community that

00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,289
were pretty supportive so we decided to

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:33,360
just contribute directly instead of

00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,770
working with open Suzanne up screen I am

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,980
a current member of the opensuse KDE

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,050
team and I'm maintainer for a couple of

00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:44,010
packages I contribute the window maker

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:48,539
you can all laugh now but that's where I

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,910
come from the food unto was a very end

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,090
user focused distribution while it while

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,399
it existed so that's kind of where my

00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:59,609
development focus is at is on end-user

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:12,330
experience so that's that's where this

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:13,409
bodega thing comes from really okay so

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,850
when I said I live in the middle of

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:19,290
nowhere that's where I live it's three

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,100
and a half hours from my house to

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:25,290
anything even resembling civilization

00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,400
yes that green truck is mine just

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,100
thought I'd give you guys a picture of

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:35,490
how I define middle of nowhere okay so

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,720
what is bodega um this actually comes

00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,509
from air in CA go with the KDE team who

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,799
wrote the original program it's a cross

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,509
platform app for digital stuff in fancy

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,509
words it creates a catalog of metadata

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:54,060
which represents digital assets digital

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,369
assets can be anything they can be

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,200
pulling applications from the pipe from

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,530
your package manager in the official

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,509
repositories could be pulling music from

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:10,050
somewhere movies books whatever I bodega

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:12,379
is not tied into any particular data

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,379
source

00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:20,010
so I kind of wanted to look a little bit

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,620
at some of the history of app stores you

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,850
know the one that everybody is most

00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,990
familiar with is the Apple ecosystem

00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:30,570
they kind of started that when they

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,890
release the iphone through itunes and

00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:35,250
through the store on the phone itself

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:40,760
and Google quickly followed with the

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,760
Android and Windows / microsoft also did

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:50,370
you know everybody knows the google

00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:55,170
earth deep apple store on their mobile

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,910
platform google obviously has theirs it

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,370
was originally branded as the android

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,280
store it morphed into the google play

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,620
store after chrome OS came around and

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,160
the chrome web browser they've kind of

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:11,580
folded a bunch of stuff into it the

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:15,780
windows phone also has a application

00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:19,110
storage like anything else so what's

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,300
happened is a lot of end users have

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:23,940
become used to this paradigm of having

00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,860
an app store where they go to get all of

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,830
their applications and in most cases

00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:33,690
most of their media to go find things so

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:35,240
naturally it evolved into they've done

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,800
this for their desktops as well

00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,860
including some Linux distributions

00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,660
opensuse not being one of them so they

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,730
bridge the gap a little bit for what the

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:48,230
end users expecting between their mobile

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,230
experience and their desktop experience

00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,230
the OS 10 app store obviously anybody

00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:59,490
that runs a Mac is run into this now and

00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,870
then the google play store is available

00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:06,870
on the desktop as well now with the

00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:09,420
Chrome OS devices Chromebooks etc with

00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:11,220
the release of Windows 8 Microsoft now

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,690
has a store that was kind of leveraged

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:18,870
off their technologies from the xbox

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:21,299
live marketplace Ubuntu has had a

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:23,820
Software Center for a while on it's

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:26,430
actually a pretty decent Software Center

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,230
I spend some time looking at hoarding a

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:31,740
lot of what they were doing over to

00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:34,230
opensuse for an end user experience they

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,670
just tie an awful lot into unity and I

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,840
didn't feel like pouring all those lives

00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:41,490
over it's just a lot of work and one

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,420
that a lot of people don't consider is

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:47,910
the steam store it is closed source I

00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:49,800
Greek I get that but it's an app store

00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,940
that makes an it makes it very easy for

00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,560
an end user to install things so they're

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,720
not having to worry about adding

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,640
repositories and going and looking for

00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,290
things they've just they've got this app

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:17,730
and I want that game they click on it

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:21,110
installs theoretically what yeah yeah so

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,990
the current state as a 13.1 anyway um

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,970
and I going to refine what I've said in

00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,470
this first point on this slide there is

00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,910
a unified application management

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:34,800
installation or face it's through you

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:36,360
ask everybody knows that one um but I've

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,340
been on the forums and in the health

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,530
channels on freenode enough a lot of

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:43,410
end-users people that aren't technically

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,510
inclined or either intimidated by or

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,730
don't understand you ask they don't

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:51,350
quite get it and it's a little hard for

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:54,750
somebody to find things in yes at times

00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:56,460
and then we've also got some fracturing

00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,170
depending on the desktop environment I'm

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,930
only going to deal with gnome and KDE

00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,840
because of the two biggest in the user

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,510
base and you know as always there is

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,560
zipper which is what I personally use I

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,020
just do a direct to the command line

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,210
there's gas and then the one-click

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:15,540
methods through software not opensuse

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:18,210
org which works very well as long as you

00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,630
know what you're looking for I was going

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,570
to look at a couple of different things

00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:27,060
those with the use KDE a / is kind of

00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:33,690
the the default KDE tool for installing

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:37,200
things I it does all right it's a little

00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:41,280
hard to use if you're looking at

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:42,810
I want to look at graphics programs it's

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,330
a little hard to break those out the

00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,340
categories aren't well set and that's

00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:51,090
not necessarily a failing of a per as it

00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:56,820
is the categories structure underneath

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:58,020
in the repositories no my actually

00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,440
talked to one of the gnome guys today

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:03,110
because i didn't know i don't use gnome

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,060
they are recommending you use you asked

00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:09,150
gnome does provide a gnome software

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,710
installer but apparently with our

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,560
package kit implementation that's got

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:18,480
some bugs so it's not a default install

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:21,240
for gnome users and then obviously the

00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:25,350
two oldest and completely platform

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,060
agnostic tools yeah Stan zipper you know

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,800
yes it's the eight headed hydra it

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,100
controls everything in the system if you

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,160
want it to which can be a good thing and

00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,990
can be a bad thing like i said i know a

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,550
lot i have end user types that are

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,110
confused by you asked and what it

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:45,390
doesn't doesn't do etc zipper works

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:49,110
great if you're comfortable dropping

00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:50,370
into a terminal you know then a lot of

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:54,000
people aren't or a lot of people just

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,560
don't want to i don't personally

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,180
understand them all that well but there

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:03,630
are the people that don't want to so you

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,680
know why why am I looking and the couple

00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,600
of guys that are working with me at an

00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,730
app store you know for an average user

00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:11,910
it's an easy interface to find

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,470
applications to install stuff that are

00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:16,350
compatible their platform where they can

00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,790
just click and it runs you know it pulls

00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:22,230
out of the repositories everything goes

00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:25,140
um and it also maintains a record of

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,960
your purchases and etc so you can go

00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,990
back and look at things not the zipper

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,099
and/or yes don't you know you can always

00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,060
look at what you've got installed on

00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:39,630
your system but what a lot of the other

00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:41,760
stores do is you download something you

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,700
try it you didn't like it you uninstall

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,440
it it still maintains a record that you

00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,790
would install that at one point so later

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,470
on you can go well I'd like to try that

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:52,330
again and you've got a listing of every

00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,630
that you have downloaded that's not

00:08:52,330 --> 00:09:00,160
necessarily installed which can be handy

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:03,070
i use it on my android phone a lot so

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,100
why bodega as opposed to some of these

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:09,760
other technologies technically bo Duggan

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:12,280
is platform agnostic ah obviously my

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,830
initial focus is for opensuse there's no

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:19,210
reason bodega couldn't run on arch

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:21,660
Fedora debian even on the BS DS if some

00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:25,000
of the bsd guys were interested in it

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:28,690
right now as written it does leverage

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,370
package kit so any distribution that's

00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:33,160
got packaged kit you could technically

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:36,150
take what i write install it and you

00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,160
would be able to use the use the program

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:40,990
the current client that i'll show you a

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,000
little bit later here it is written with

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:45,900
plasma active in mind this project comes

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,640
out of the gov kds plasma active project

00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,250
so it's a it's sort of designed with it

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,400
with a touch interest reen interface in

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,380
mind but it does work and i do i'll show

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,310
that a little later I've got it

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,570
installable one for everybody to check

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,950
out so the advantages to this is you

00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,580
know obviously the plat being platform

00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,890
agnostic um the nice thing about bodega

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,940
even though opensuse as of right now

00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:16,570
isn't set up to do this is you can use

00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,560
it to provide a revenue stream I'll talk

00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:22,650
about that a minute here and we can also

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,900
create stores for non official

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:30,790
repositories that give all of the proper

00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:34,890
licensing warnings end user agreements

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:37,900
things like the Nvidia and AMD drivers

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:41,470
closed source programs like Skype the

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,580
google chrome and the stuff that most of

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:46,180
us are currently getting from pac-man

00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:49,390
like the video and audio codecs where

00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,720
it's not having to be added into the

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:54,640
official opensuse repositories you just

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,870
create a store for them within bodega

00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:00,820
that pulls from those repositories and

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,890
as i said with the appropriate licensing

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,779
warnings that way nobody's getting in

00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:09,660
trouble for viola

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:13,170
licensing and patents the current state

00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:14,970
it is in its original form I've got the

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:16,079
link up there to the repository where it

00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,740
could be installed if you want to have a

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,439
look at what currently exists it's a

00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,930
little screwy in that the command is

00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:28,680
started it has nothing to do with Bodega

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:30,360
and I haven't fixed that yet so it's

00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,160
actually active add-ons as part of the

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:38,249
part of the plasma active add-ons for

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:41,399
KDE this is just the initial window for

00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:42,990
the client as you can see they haven't

00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:48,209
put a whole lot of work on the active

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:50,249
site into making it pretty yet and I

00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:52,019
don't know how readable it is but it

00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:59,309
does have a couple of default stores set

00:11:52,019 --> 00:12:01,290
up there's a couple of apps in here

00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:03,660
there's some books they've got it tied

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,970
into google's gutenberg project you can

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,680
download books that way and then they've

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:10,740
got some wallpapers and they're

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,939
currently working with a project whose

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,220
name I can't remember right now to

00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,600
provide a lot of theming and wallpaper

00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:22,290
stuff for your various desktop

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:23,910
environments so where am i planning on

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,360
going where we planning on going with

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,980
this I'm actually looking when I write

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,639
the front end for this to take it a

00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,439
little further away from package kit and

00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,009
work closer with the ass team and

00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:42,180
leverage lives if instead of package kit

00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:44,579
for opensuse purposes just because I

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,920
like it better oh it's going to be

00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:51,829
written a pure treat cutie client no

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,850
Katie dependencies so gnome users xfce

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:56,069
window maker who have whatever

00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:57,540
environment you're running you're not

00:12:56,069 --> 00:13:01,889
gonna be pulling half of Katie Ann with

00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:03,329
it just to run this program and I need

00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,129
to get down and I haven't done this yet

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,889
there's a server-side parser I need to

00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:10,589
write it'll most likely be an oj s that

00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:13,040
is going to parse all of the app data

00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:15,270
xml files and build the stores

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:18,540
automatically it'll

00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:21,650
just troll the repositories pull that

00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:25,260
xml in and turn them into bodega assets

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:28,140
that way on the end-user site you don't

00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:32,040
ever have to really add repositories the

00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,990
stores will be set up and you click on

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:40,080
it it'll add the repositories and you

00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:41,670
ask and you're good to go and then you

00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,250
know items that are possible in the

00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,990
future that I'm not going to or we're

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,890
not going to worry about right off the

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,940
bat is the monetization angle the

00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:52,110
biggest reason we're not worried about

00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,270
that right now just because it's

00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,120
opensuse as an organization doesn't have

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:59,040
any way to handle money that's a board

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,120
issue I know it's been discussed ad

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,830
nauseam and I've heard some rumblings

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,170
that they're working on something to

00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:10,710
deal with that sort of thing but that

00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:14,160
monetization could be you know the

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:17,880
example I use you could set up a store

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,350
through the amazon affiliate program for

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:24,210
buying mp3s or books or whatever

00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:25,620
whatever whatever organization opensuse

00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:28,280
has set up could be making their half a

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,630
cent per transaction off of those and

00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,950
pay for things like travel assistance

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,480
doing these conferences I you know

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:40,470
whatever the board decides to do with it

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,490
or organization obviously the external

00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:46,080
repositories the were most of us that

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:49,140
use it opens who's on the desktop or

00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,400
running I don't like Skype any better

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:54,600
than you do but everybody in their dog

00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:57,690
uses it pacman obviously has some of the

00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,190
the non-free license stuff that we all

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,780
use on a regular basis and then you know

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:06,900
the last item would be porting to other

00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:08,480
platforms once i get the client written

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,610
it's not going to be that big a deal to

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,440
get it out there into the open which

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:15,690
theoretically could bring me help in

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,360
from other platforms that don't have an

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:24,320
app store set up that want to get in on

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:27,060
it and the last slide I've got is just

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,080
you know the install of previews are on

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,530
OBS

00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,660
and those will be updated as I go my

00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,030
working source tree is on bitbucket I've

00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:38,820
got the earlier and then the upstream

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,520
sources on katie's get it's an official

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:43,890
KDE project that they're hammering on so

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:47,190
if you'd like to have a look you're more

00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:49,830
than welcome to and that's all I've got

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:52,080
as far as the presentation goes does

00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:59,700
anybody have any questions or want to

00:15:52,080 --> 00:16:01,860
tell me I'm crazy or otherwise just a

00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,040
little comment you said that you are

00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:07,260
looking for expanding the client our

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,290
getting help from under distributions

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,570
and on the same side you said that you

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,960
are dropping package config and going

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:18,060
for lips it directly which will actually

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,030
be counterproductive to getting more

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:23,100
help from the outside right ah and

00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:28,440
that's because a package kid already

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:31,820
works oh ok you know so I don't need to

00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:34,440
do any development on that I just I

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:37,320
we've all run into issues a package get

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:40,170
here and there and if I can tie directly

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:45,210
in the lib zip for opensuse purposes it

00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:49,880
would really be nice ok I might be a

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:51,930
little bit confused there was a

00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:57,120
application in the beginning that was

00:16:51,930 --> 00:17:01,230
kt1 plasma thingy right and you are

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,500
writing pure cutie qml dingy yeah that's

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,270
the right of the origin application or

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,449
Fork of the urgent application modified

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:12,089
or something from scratch it's gonna be

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,520
working partially from scratch i'm going

00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:16,680
to use their i'm actually working with

00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,480
the KDE guys to get this developed the

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,170
desktop because this was originally

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:26,010
intended for their plasma active set up

00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:27,930
which is for tablets phones etc so i

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,680
will be up screaming everything i do

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:34,790
back to the KDE guys so it can then be

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:38,010
poured it out to wherever it needs to go

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:41,780
ok thanks oh no problem looks because

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,780
looks looks really exciting

00:17:52,159 --> 00:18:00,659
hello I did you wait you mean to have

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,909
all those repositories defined do you

00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:06,659
mean to provide the service on your

00:18:02,909 --> 00:18:09,350
servers where you will have all let's

00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:13,649
say upstream repositories defined

00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:17,340
outside then that part I am actually

00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:19,020
still working out you know it as it sits

00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,950
right now as soon as I get that partial

00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:26,909
written that file could actually just go

00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:28,440
into the repository on OBS I need to

00:18:26,909 --> 00:18:31,169
talk to the OBS guys to see if they're

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,360
okay with me adding a file but it's

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:34,740
gonna be minimal overhead for that it's

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,440
going to be you know basically a single

00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:45,179
XML file that bodega will look for when

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:47,250
it's looking at a repository so um yeah

00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,169
one one thing and I mean this is less of

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,570
a question or more of her comments I

00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:53,220
guess cuz it's something I I understood

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,440
when I talk Aaron about this at some

00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:02,090
point and I didn't see your presentation

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:04,770
so much and is this element where bodega

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:08,279
can grab content from multiple locations

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:11,700
and show it in one place right this this

00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:15,870
is something and it can do them in kc

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:19,309
more about that or yeah that's um let me

00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,309
get back to that slide real quick

00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:29,029
so in this view which probably isn't

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,069
really great the pictures a little small

00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:35,639
you would have a list of your various

00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:37,919
stores here where I could break it out

00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:39,599
when I do my parts of the official

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:47,359
repositories which is where I'm focusing

00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:47,359
to begin we're using the app data from

00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:56,669
the XML files that are generated by OBS

00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:58,679
you'll be able to break it out to you

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:00,269
basically create a group that's a

00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,619
desktop group or if you were looking for

00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:04,949
desktop software you click on the

00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:06,479
desktop tab and it would list software

00:20:04,949 --> 00:20:07,979
the suitable for the desktop but you

00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:11,459
could do a server tab you could do

00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:14,339
whatever and you can aggregate through

00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:16,109
this anything you want you could build a

00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:18,329
store for anything if you're an

00:20:16,109 --> 00:20:20,039
independent software vendor and you have

00:20:18,329 --> 00:20:22,459
a product that you would like to get on

00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:26,039
here it doesn't even have to go into the

00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:28,769
official opensuse repose if you can

00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:32,329
package it to run on opensuse you can

00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:36,209
build your own back-end for this and

00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:37,229
bodega will go find it and you'll be

00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:41,039
able to provide it through this

00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:42,809
interface obviously but it can also be

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,539
other things right I mean he gave

00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:49,109
example about if you're an independent

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:51,059
book writer you can actually set up a

00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:52,949
take on your own server at home and sell

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:56,369
your book there and then it will be

00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:59,339
available for well on every you know

00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:01,919
book including but they got you r I if

00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:03,719
they want to so I mean the thing is of

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,699
course we on the linux platform we have

00:21:03,719 --> 00:21:07,589
a very fragmented platform at I mean

00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:10,619
there is there is Ubuntu and there's

00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:12,839
opensuse and fedora and arts and Oman

00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:15,629
jarrow and whatever else there is and

00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:19,709
they're all different so if you try to

00:21:15,629 --> 00:21:21,209
sell say you know a movie if you want to

00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:22,589
sell it to linux users that kind of

00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:23,969
pointless because you can't reach them

00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:26,429
all and let you go through all these

00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:27,509
learning different districts and this is

00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:29,999
actually a solution for that problem

00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:32,699
yeah so you basically immediately grab

00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:34,289
the whole market potentially which makes

00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:37,380
it a lot more interesting actually to

00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,600
try and reach then its users

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,880
for content providers needs an

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,050
application providers etc yes and that's

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:49,560
why once I get something working on

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:53,580
opensuse I intend to look at porting to

00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:56,670
other platforms obviously opensuse

00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:00,630
packages from the default repositories

00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,460
are going to work on fedora or debian or

00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,980
whichever disco you want to play with

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,470
but all of the other stores you might be

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,540
able to do and anybody can create a

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:13,080
store it's actually very simple or sir

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,300
there in the repository they get

00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:19,350
repository from KDE there's a bodega

00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:22,440
server so if you're writing books are

00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:27,050
making music or making short films or

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,270
whatever you could tie that in notify

00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:31,980
whichever main server I'm going to have

00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:34,790
a query in which I don't have I don't

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,010
have that part of decided yet and that

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:40,740
would make it available to anybody

00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,840
running the bodega client on whichever

00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,420
platform and the nice thing is that you

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:47,430
can also have multiple UI for it so if

00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:50,480
you are that book writer you can also

00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,980
create a store you I for your website

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,330
that only shows books because after all

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,430
your visitors will probably only

00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:59,760
interested in books and that hides all

00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:01,650
the software and all the other stuff so

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,020
it can basically become a whole network

00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:06,900
of connected stores that all offer

00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:09,750
various things and you ice for it that

00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:14,520
all only show parts of what is available

00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:18,720
on the network basically it's it's quite

00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,630
a bigger thing than single vendor single

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,580
person controls you know single channel

00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:26,070
thing you have to see there's a multiple

00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,200
backends multiple from bands and then

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,120
one Bottega surf in the middle which

00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,580
doesn't actually host the content that

00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,370
doesn't have to if you have opensuse

00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:36,780
packages in Bodega then his server his

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:39,330
bday go server if you would run that

00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:41,820
doesn't host the packages it just hosts

00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,470
basically XML files basically one-click

00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,420
install files that just grab the files

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:48,570
from the downloaded of zoos the dog

00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:50,250
server so it's really about federating

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,880
all this content from all these sources

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,010
in

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,510
while different stores that are all

00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,250
optimized to mean on the gnome desktop

00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:58,530
you can say well I just want to know my

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:02,100
applications fair enough you can do that

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:04,680
quite easily and only show relevant

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,870
applications and if fedora and ubuntu

00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:08,520
and debian are all in there well you

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:11,040
only share what relevant on your wrist

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,380
row so it's all based on tax not even

00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,490
groups or category but text so it really

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,810
is very flexible it can be anything yeah

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:23,520
which one sorry I left out of the

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:31,670
presentation luckily I'm here ya go oh

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:38,850
my so that's all I've got on it unless

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:40,940
anybody else has any questions ok thank

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,940
