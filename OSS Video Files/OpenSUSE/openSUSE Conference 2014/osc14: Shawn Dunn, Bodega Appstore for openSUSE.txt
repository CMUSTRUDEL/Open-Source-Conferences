Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Bodega is an appstore developed by the Plasma-Active team within KDE. This talk will be an overview of Bodega, how it works, how and/or whether the openSUSE community would like something like this included in the distribution, as well as some demonstrations of how it works. Additionally, Bodega does offer "Store" Functionality, and this would be covered, as an informational/discussion topic, as it could potentially offer a revenue stream to openSUSE
