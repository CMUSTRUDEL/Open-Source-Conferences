Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Jolla is the company founded and run by ex-Nokia employees to continue with N9 legacy. They didn't have anything left from Nokia, except the idea for making a great phone that is based on real GNU/Linux and uses modern trends in OSS world. They managed to create such a phone, started selling in and this talk with cover my personal experience from both using it and developing for it. What is cool about it? What is not cool? Come and see.

	00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:12,980
so hi everybody my name is Michael Hirsh

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:19,760
its key and last year I got my new phone

00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:24,689
this is it and it's really amazing and

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,460
I'm going to talk about it here so let's

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,039
start with a little bit about history

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,550
what this phone is about and where it

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,700
comes from so what start with ancient

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:39,510
history back in the days there was

00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,820
something called sharps hours it was one

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,410
of the freeze first PDAs I think it was

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:52,590
the first PDA that was based on linux it

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:57,620
was second okay what was the first now

00:00:52,590 --> 00:01:00,780
this was before the eye bags ipex were

00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:06,150
building on top of the UI that sharp

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:09,600
head so it was using linux kernel and it

00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:14,310
was using beauty based you I it was

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,850
called utopia then there were some buddy

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,780
there were some people porting this UI

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:26,670
and clinics in general to their devices

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:30,420
like mentioned I packs and then came

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:34,979
Nokia and started doing this linux

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:40,049
tablets it was running some debian like

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:47,159
system it was it had a GT car gtk based

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:51,090
UI and they gradually evolved into cell

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,030
phones and they created something called

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:57,030
mingle and that was the last step of

00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:02,700
their evolution and then something else

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:07,950
happened what happened next was they got

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:11,819
new CEO and this CEO was former head of

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:16,109
some business division and Microsoft

00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:19,469
and Nokia made the deal with Microsoft

00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:22,409
and they stopped all the development of

00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:25,790
the Linux phone started promoting their

00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:30,239
windows phones and pretended that Linux

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,340
never happened and never was there and

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,290
they got rid of all the people that were

00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,480
working on it at least that's what I

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:41,430
gathered from the outside might be there

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,700
are some mistakes and then these people

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:47,340
that got out from Nokia and they were

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,730
working on this Linux phones that they

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,419
liked they started a new company and

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:58,829
call it yola and they started working on

00:02:54,419 --> 00:03:02,609
this phone it was possible to preorder

00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:07,699
it last year in May and they started

00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:11,040
shipping it in december so few people

00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:13,829
who were trusting them enough send their

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:19,259
money in May and hope that they will get

00:03:13,829 --> 00:03:23,220
something back for the Christmas so what

00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:27,750
did we get hardware-wise is something

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:35,340
not exceptional but so also nothing

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:42,560
really slow to course arm v7 gigabyte

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:46,979
RAM and all the usual stuff what is

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:53,069
really cool about the phone is actually

00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:57,419
the software and let's start with basics

00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:59,879
now root file system is butter FS many

00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:04,500
many distributions are not brave enough

00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:09,599
to use battery FS as a default we are

00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,849
one of the exceptions it's using Wayland

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,539
I don't think there is a distribution

00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:19,560
that is already brave enough to put it

00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:23,760
as a default we are slowly getting there

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,020
on desktop but references little bit

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,849
further away

00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:34,199
and its uses systemd as most of the

00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:39,360
modern distributions and it also ships

00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:43,620
with QT 5.1 with some cheat snapshots

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:49,710
and intention is to end up at QT five

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:53,509
dots too but it's not there yet and one

00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:59,069
cool thing is that they actually have

00:04:53,509 --> 00:05:02,130
android vm well this java vm or it's

00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,590
actually dalvik vm running there so you

00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,710
can actually run native android

00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:11,039
application on your phone and it kind of

00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,340
integrate it doesn't behave like a

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,699
native application but it integrates

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:20,849
quite good you can just download apks

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:23,099
install them and it will they belong you

00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:26,250
can install most of the applications

00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:29,909
that you could install on any Android

00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,030
device issues are that multitasking

00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:35,759
works differently in android so it

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:41,279
doesn't integrate with multitasking on

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:44,669
Nuala and there is also there are also

00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,009
some small issues like accessing contact

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:49,349
lists your Android applications actually

00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:53,190
can't access your local contacts on your

00:05:49,349 --> 00:06:02,630
yola which is actually kind of good I

00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:05,370
would say and like that another part of

00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,060
selfish that's the name of the operating

00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:12,300
system is that is based on the Nemo

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,690
which is open source project open source

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:22,620
successor to me go as far as I remember

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:24,990
and the company behind is committed to

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,990
do regular updates they are currently

00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:30,860
doing updates every month so every month

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:35,130
you get new bug fixes and new features

00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:37,849
so it's really evolving and every month

00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,629
you get a bunch of surprises

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:44,360
mostly Pleasant funds and yeah that's

00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:47,869
what I like about linux in general that

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,929
I'm always breaking some new versions

00:06:47,869 --> 00:06:55,819
and I'm giving new features every day

00:06:49,929 --> 00:07:01,339
yay and whole system is just just your

00:06:55,819 --> 00:07:03,860
based so it's not about clicking small

00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:08,539
button somewhere but about swiping

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:12,999
around what's not so cool about this

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:17,719
phone is it has pretty ancient colonel

00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:20,300
let's because they are a small company

00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:23,749
there are they just entered the market

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,300
and they explained it it was really

00:07:23,749 --> 00:07:29,809
difficult for them to get hardware

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,580
vendors to work with them so their

00:07:29,809 --> 00:07:37,699
solution was actually kind of cool they

00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,099
told the hardware vendor we don't need

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:43,219
real Linux adaptation just prepare us

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:46,309
the Android adaptation and they made the

00:07:43,219 --> 00:07:50,180
wrappers and it so they are using

00:07:46,309 --> 00:07:53,329
android kernel and made the wrappers

00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:57,139
around it so they can use android

00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:59,180
drivers in wayland and basically use the

00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:03,139
android app tation layer that they got

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:06,349
from hardware vendor also there is also

00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:11,619
quite old GCC they are working on new

00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:18,979
one and the UI is actually close to us

00:08:11,619 --> 00:08:21,669
that's one big disadvantage now when I

00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:25,449
spoke about you I let's take a look at

00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:28,639
how you can write applications for it

00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:35,959
native applications are written in C++

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:38,060
and QT and qml for me it's kind of nice

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:41,360
because I can finally write applications

00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:44,060
for my cell phone in C++ that's nice I

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
don't have to touch ugly Java let I

00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:49,450
don't like

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,960
and the little bit nasty part is that

00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:57,910
you can't actually avoid cutie and qml

00:08:52,960 --> 00:09:01,780
parts all you i should be in qml and to

00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:06,340
get stuff to qml you have to go to cutie

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:09,220
and yeah I love cutie I used it as a

00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:11,860
library to help me with many things but

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:15,690
I've done like being forced to use it

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:22,740
for everything I like to use libraries

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:27,760
that are using stl and also not all

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:30,550
api's are considered stable yet which

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,400
means that there are parts of the phone

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:37,240
that you can access but if you do that

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:41,350
you cannot get into a fish store for

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:45,340
example one issue is GPS location you

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:48,100
can get access to debt and get to the

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:52,720
official store that's why there are

00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:57,040
unofficial stores which actually doesn't

00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,600
have any QA and anybody can do pretty

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,540
much anything which is also on other on

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:08,590
other side of the spectrum so there are

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:12,180
packages that are installing some files

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:14,740
into sue doors and stuff like that so

00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,850
you have to be cautious about that part

00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:21,880
and the other way how you can submit

00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,710
applications to Jana is you right

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,790
android application and because it has

00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:30,000
pretty good android layer you actually

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,690
can install the android applications and

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,240
actually there is this trick that

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:39,700
android has stable api so you can access

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,490
even this gps location that you cannot

00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:49,210
access natively at least in official

00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:52,330
store the other important part about you

00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:55,140
there's actually one really exciting

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:58,470
hardware part and it's the other half

00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,370
these back covers

00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:07,100
they are made in different colors and

00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:10,680
they are replaceable and to make it more

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:15,540
interesting they're a little bit more

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:22,020
than just a color for color cover they

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:25,860
have RFID tags that you can so the phone

00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:29,340
automatically recognizes what cover did

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:33,450
you put on so it can reach the color of

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:36,150
that cover and download the team that

00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:39,810
will match the cover so when you replace

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:42,530
the cover also your OS will adapt to the

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:47,970
same color so it will match the cover

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:52,080
and what's more interesting for people

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:56,210
that like to play with hardware is that

00:11:52,080 --> 00:12:00,180
it actually has access to I square C and

00:11:56,210 --> 00:12:02,760
it has power in and power out so you can

00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,070
actually church your phone from the car

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,840
and you can charge additional

00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:09,150
accessories that are in the cover and

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:17,430
communicate with them we have ice i

00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:19,740
square see this image is the back of the

00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:25,830
cover and you can see here are the pins

00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:30,630
for i square c and power output and here

00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:34,350
is the power input and part of the phone

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:37,050
is also sdk where you can find

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,950
descriptions how this stuff works and

00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:45,120
also 3d model so we can print out your

00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:48,050
covers actually my friend print it a 3d

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,210
cover printed on 3d printer cover for me

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:54,930
but unfortunately I forgot it at the

00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:56,670
hotel so tomorrow I will bring it and if

00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,810
you are interested you can take a look

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:03,720
at it we are still iterating and it's

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:07,350
not perfect yet but I feel that the

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,830
first iteration will be really great and

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,720
will fit

00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:16,350
so now little bit more about the other

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,450
house what people actually did one of

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,470
the cool improvements was somebody

00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:26,970
actually created the cover with building

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,339
solar panel so he can just turn his

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:35,520
phone around put it on the Sun and

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:37,770
recharged his battery and other thing is

00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,520
that plenty of people were actually

00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:44,370
missing hardware keyboard because here

00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:46,470
people like to ssh from their phone they

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,220
like to coat on their phone and stuff

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:54,000
like that so somebody actually made the

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,490
cover with crack the keyboard so you can

00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,240
actually pull down the full qwerty

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:07,950
keyboard and start riding dance thanks

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:12,060
to I square C and as I was speaking

00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:14,040
about development developers mode is

00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,029
just a click away it's actually one of

00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,829
the settings in the cell phone you just

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,779
goes to the settings and there is a

00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:25,770
developer mode so you click on it it

00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:28,770
says hey it's dangerous don't do that if

00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,520
you know what you are doing and you

00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:35,610
really want to do that click yes and

00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:38,790
once you click yes it will root your

00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,250
phone install some more utilities that

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:45,899
you might find helpful and since then

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:48,360
you have ssh available you have sooo

00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,510
available you can be root on your device

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:55,170
you can install zipper and you can play

00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:58,950
with whatever you want yeah operating

00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:01,980
system is rpm based and they actually

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:05,040
have public OBS thing stands that you

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:08,190
can use to build packages for your cell

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,550
phone and what I also try it is

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:14,670
installing opensuse into change hood so

00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:18,000
as there are not so many utilities for

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:20,610
the selfish already are installed arm

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,360
open suse so i have plenty of packages

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:27,060
now

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,870
and that was this part if you have a

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:33,000
questions I can ask answer them now and

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:35,670
in the rest of the time i will show you

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:39,660
actually how how it looks like in

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:48,050
emulator the system so any questions

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:53,690
right now no so let's go to the emulator

00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:53,690
this is uh oh yeah

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:16,680
okay Tess okay so this is the home

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:22,100
screen how it looks like when you unlock

00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:26,730
or power up your phone and your eyes

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:29,580
vertical based so i will just swipe down

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:33,720
and it will show up the applications

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:36,450
that I've got running these are just

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:40,340
minimized applications what you can see

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:45,690
out of them now is called cover and

00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:50,850
these covers can be if you don't provide

00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:53,900
the cover it will be running picture of

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:57,990
your application actually it will be

00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:00,270
scaled down your application with

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,410
everything that is on there but you can

00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,860
replace it with something that is

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:07,800
actually more useful because if I put

00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:10,140
their big screen and just scale it down

00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,110
it would be hard to read so you can just

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,439
pinpoint some information for example I

00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:19,790
have load and uptime in one of the

00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:24,180
applications shown the other part is

00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:27,120
that the discovers can also be used to

00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:32,100
do some actions like the color on the

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:36,450
right I will just drag it to a they get

00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:40,260
to one side and now I did some action

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:42,150
that is defined in the application so

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:47,550
without actually opening the application

00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:51,930
full screen I can do some basic stuff if

00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:57,510
I click on it it will maximize there is

00:17:51,930 --> 00:18:01,140
no home or back button as you are used

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:05,790
to from Android back is done actually by

00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:10,170
swiping to the left and if I want to go

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:12,930
home I will just swipe from outside of

00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,110
the screen and it will minimize the

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:19,179
application

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,420
if I swipe down from the app which is

00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:24,420
basically from outside of the screen

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:28,720
then it will close the application and

00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:33,670
if I swipe from down from outside of the

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:40,390
screen and I broke it that doesn't

00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:45,820
happen on the phone and i'm not sure

00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:52,960
what to do with it now yeah it should

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:58,799
have braked up the notifications now

00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:06,280
let's see if I will manage to recover it

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:08,799
yeah I'm back now applications doesn't

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:11,980
also have this menu button that you are

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,950
used to from android menus are also used

00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:17,440
little bit differently you will just put

00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:22,179
down not from outside of the screen and

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,880
it will show up the menu and by

00:19:22,179 --> 00:19:29,230
releasing you would actually select the

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:32,020
option that is highlighted so i'll

00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:40,780
switch apps only and will show all

00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:43,750
processes and if you want to run

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:47,350
applications after this home screen with

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:48,929
the covers you can scroll down and there

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,429
is the rest of your applications

00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:54,400
unfortunately in emulator i don't have

00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:56,679
that many that will overflow but on my

00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:02,860
cell phone i have multiple other screens

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:06,490
full of applications so that was the

00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:10,780
quick demo if you are interested more i

00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:13,510
think i have tomorrow some lightning

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:16,900
talk about how to write applications for

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:20,049
this OS i will show you how to do it in

00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:25,900
QT creator and show you what this qml

00:20:20,049 --> 00:20:27,049
about and some basics so thank you for

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:32,720
your attention and

00:20:27,049 --> 00:20:40,100
do you have questions now yeah I think I

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:44,110
were was first is the gesture support

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,600
open source or in the closed sauce pot

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:53,090
gestures are part of the UI and that's

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:55,879
close for clothes so spot my question is

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:59,450
if I want to get it the dead phone but I

00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:03,710
should do right now because yeah okay

00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:07,039
now you should go to show dot yo la calm

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:10,279
and they are selling the phone they will

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:15,460
ship it to you Calculon available only

00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:18,970
in Europe and it costs I think 400 years

00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:23,929
which is I don't not really cheap that

00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:27,679
it's really good okay did you say that

00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:32,649
um it has it uses zipper by default or

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:37,909
is that just for it uses RPM and it uses

00:21:32,649 --> 00:21:41,659
stats over but it uses package config by

00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:44,299
default for their store and other stores

00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:47,239
they are using package config but you

00:21:44,299 --> 00:21:50,539
can install zipper it's available in the

00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:51,859
repositories and also what would the

00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:54,919
what are the reasons for the

00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:57,559
restrictions on their app store and the

00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,940
animal and on the API you know at GPS

00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:07,820
okay yeah jurisdictions aren't there

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:10,639
because the API in QT is not marked as

00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:15,529
stable or was not marked as the stable

00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:19,549
and might change in the future and they

00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:21,769
didn't want it to well basically force

00:22:19,549 --> 00:22:26,570
everybody to adapt their applications

00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:31,999
when they go to the final qt5 point to

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:34,730
where it should be stable so that was

00:22:31,999 --> 00:22:37,609
their reasoning for not stabilizing some

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,850
of the api's but they are going to

00:22:37,609 --> 00:22:42,910
stabilize them

00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,549
and i saw on Melanie's they are going

00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:48,280
even to provide more like they're

00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:52,360
working on providing options to write

00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:56,440
applications in Python and I saw some

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,809
discussions about sdl so once they

00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,150
consider this API stable enough they

00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,370
might be able to enter the official

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:08,760
store currently they are available in

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:11,740
unofficial one yep one addition to the

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,960
question how can you get it normally at

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,390
every open source conference you can get

00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,039
a promo code I don't remember was ten or

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,679
twenty percent I'm surprised you can't

00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:23,049
get one here I can contact them this

00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:24,970
evening I'm not sure how flexible they

00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:28,150
are better we will have one tomorrow but

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,919
I will try so if you're em seriously

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,250
interested ask me tomorrow but was the

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,250
result

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:49,310
is there a way to run an x over on it or

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:55,110
any let's say desktop environment or

00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:57,750
just minimal with and well x server in

00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:59,910
and sorry add additional after that is

00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:04,080
there something that you can lock it

00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:10,890
into and may be connected to hdmi or a

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:16,230
screen okay so hdmi i haven't seen it

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:22,500
yet and adapt because i don't think that

00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:24,810
it will pass through i square C and for

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:28,920
the xserver it's running standard valent

00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:32,130
so and most modern tool kits are

00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:36,560
supporting violent I think gtk and QT

00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:42,150
already do and don't three supports it

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:45,450
also I think plasma as well so it's just

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:48,450
a matter of time till they will make

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:50,820
sure enough or just try to compile them

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:55,500
with veil and support and then it should

00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:59,040
be possible to run them on viola because

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:01,830
it was it already has the valent other

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:05,130
option is i think there is a way how to

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:07,620
run x applications in wayland but i

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:11,310
don't know much about it i haven't tried

00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:13,650
it and the issue with running purex

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:16,160
would be that you will be missing all

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:21,020
the drivers for graphical card and

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:25,170
therefore most of the acceleration so

00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:28,260
yeah they built a rapper to support

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:35,390
vaillant but they didn't care about X

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:35,390
that is going to die soon maybe

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:44,170
so which GPU is it on the snow dragon

00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:47,260
thing and I don't remember something

00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:49,870
okay but we can take a look at after the

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:53,890
topic or well after the talk I have

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:55,210
another dog but yeah we can meet me

00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:58,480
during the conference and take a look

00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,670
because i've used n900 few years which

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,140
is nice and i just say is the Predis at

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:05,350
the last phone you could do this kind of

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:06,670
thing with and the ending but one big

00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,470
disincentive for my point of view is

00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,000
that it's our p.m. stuff you know it

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,260
isn't bad it's just that I don't know

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,520
all that and I don't really want to have

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,200
to learn it just to put apps on my phone

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,060
well are you going to teach me tomorrow

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,610
so maybe that problem is solved yeah

00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:22,240
well maybe for a PM stuff they actually

00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:26,080
won one other thing that they don't like

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,790
in the store is dependencies you they

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,110
actually encourage you to bundle

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:34,680
everything because that's the

00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:37,690
proprietary App Store thingy and

00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,630
actually I think some doctor guys or

00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,150
virtualization guys actually I thinking

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:48,100
about the same direction like bundle

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:52,120
everything and yeah you should give RPM

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:55,290
a try i try to debian packaging and i

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,880
will tell you that yes back files are

00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:06,490
heaven compared to what you have to end

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:09,730
your everyday i was wondering if they're

00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:13,800
in you have any plans for a hardware

00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:16,990
refresh like are they planning it and i

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,720
didn't know about any of future plans

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:24,010
but what I know is that they are working

00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:26,800
on porting selfish to existing devices

00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:30,480
because they have this under a petition

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:33,760
layer and there's already some

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:39,550
experimental ports to Nexus 4 and nexus

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:41,440
one these are without the android vm

00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:46,210
because they're licensed it from

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:47,710
somebody and this is due to license it

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:50,140
isn't they cannot

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:54,100
tell anybody to do it and I don't think

00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:56,080
these pots are official yet but people

00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:58,289
from community made them and it's

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:03,789
possible to try it even on other devices

00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:08,049
and I think they plan to grow with that

00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:11,460
way as well at least they they showed

00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:16,570
some beta of Android launcher that

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:18,789
simulates this behavior and yeah they

00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:22,500
said that they want to go this way if

00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:25,299
you are able to run sanaa en mode then

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,940
at some point in the future you might be

00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:30,789
able to run selfish without this Android

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,919
layer with native applications but

00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:35,169
native applications are getting better

00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,289
every day and there is quite some of

00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:41,110
them already and I'm able to do most of

00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:45,840
my stuff inside the native applications

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,840
what I use android 4 is games

00:28:52,980 --> 00:29:06,360
we have two minutes in follow-up to the

00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:09,340
debian package installed when n900

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,669
ceased change to me go and there was the

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:16,419
change from debian to RPM I think there

00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:18,909
was an application called forum that

00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:22,299
allowed you to install Debian package to

00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:23,769
the RPM based system I would not be

00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,710
surprised if you can still compile that

00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:32,379
and it would work but I don't know but

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:34,090
that would be a way to go for you but in

00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:37,720
general if you are writing new

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:40,200
applications for selfish the spec file

00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,669
that you need is very simple and

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:47,850
actually QT creator will create it for

00:29:42,669 --> 00:29:51,399
you so you don't have to bother ok so

00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:53,590
thank you and see some of you tomorrow

00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:56,769
on my ad talk about developing

00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:58,899
applications and if you have any more

00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:01,919
questions or want to play with it catch

00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:01,919
