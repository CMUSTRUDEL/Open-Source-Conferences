Title: osc14: Michael Meeks, The Document Foundation and LibreOffice
Publication date: 2014-04-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Come hear the story of The Document Foundation, from the
birthing pains up until the latest LibreOffice features of today.
Hear why we did what we did, the key players including openSUSE and
the parts they played. Hear how a vision of a collaborative ecosystem
around the code-base created something bigger than all of us, to which
we are loyal. See how we managed to build consensus, co-ordinate and
make decisions between hundreds of contributors in a meritocratic and
vendor neutral fashion.

Finally, I hope to showcase the latest juicy features we have in
LibreOffice 4.2 and under development.
