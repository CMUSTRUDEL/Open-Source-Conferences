Title: osc14: Michael Meeks, The Document Foundation and LibreOffice
Publication date: 2014-04-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Come hear the story of The Document Foundation, from the
birthing pains up until the latest LibreOffice features of today.
Hear why we did what we did, the key players including openSUSE and
the parts they played. Hear how a vision of a collaborative ecosystem
around the code-base created something bigger than all of us, to which
we are loyal. See how we managed to build consensus, co-ordinate and
make decisions between hundreds of contributors in a meritocratic and
vendor neutral fashion.

Finally, I hope to showcase the latest juicy features we have in
LibreOffice 4.2 and under development.

	00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:06,990
all right good morning everyone I hope

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:08,580
you had a great first day at OC before

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,679
we get started this morning somehow I

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:13,259
turned into the announcement guy so you

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,100
have to listen to me for Babylon here

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:18,289
for a couple of minutes food today

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,260
hopefully all turned in your little

00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,750
cards yesterday we have decided to bring

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,300
the food in so the food will be brought

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,269
in even if you didn't order takeout it

00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:32,279
will be brought here we will also try to

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,829
arrange to have the food right out here

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,739
in the lobby so we don't have to stand

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,600
in the rain and eat the second

00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:42,570
announcement is that there are three

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,969
cruise ships in town today plus 35

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,789
thousand visitors for some religious

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:50,340
event therefore the old town will be

00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,840
rather crowded it is of course up to you

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,050
whether you want to go there tonight or

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,699
not but so and also the bus schedule is

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,760
a bit different because of the amount of

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,070
people that I here so be aware of that

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:05,760
that things will be a bit clogged up and

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,189
now it is my pleasure to introduce

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,470
michael meeks who many of you will

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,610
probably know michael has worked in

00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,350
genome open office and then was a

00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:20,310
leading contributor to create the

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:22,890
document foundation which is the

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:26,820
organization that is dedicated to

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:28,920
promoting libre office and it's been

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,869
involved in open source for a very long

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,689
time involved with the opensuse project

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:36,060
he used to work in Susan now he works at

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,920
collabera and I'm very happy to

00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,140
introduce michael meeks so please coming

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,710
up and thanks for being here and please

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,710
enjoy the fall

00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:48,200
Israel is there a walkie about you

00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,830
microphone somewhere used to be 14

00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,690
questions I have to be bored or I can

00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,850
just shout as you like Oh over there can

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,010
I can I can they have it thank you I'm

00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,420
prove it let me move on this is what I'm

00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,520
gonna say but I'm not gonna say it just

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,950
now because then I'll have said it and

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,350
that would be really quick so yeah here

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:11,630
we go five seconds so I would point out

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:14,780
this is a historical narrative it's not

00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:15,890
a phase today's world and the reason

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,540
that I'll say that is that the

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:20,050
openoffice project you see today is very

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:22,370
different to the one that came before

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,980
nevertheless it's perhaps useful to

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,530
understand why libreoff has happened and

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,300
what went on so there are a number of

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,150
things about openoffice in the bad old

00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,769
days so we're really quite comic the

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,510
first thing was a massive processed

00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:37,160
burden you know so it was decided that

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,360
in order to change anything in

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,030
openoffice because obviously was the

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,670
pinnacle of perfection you know it was

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,070
necessary to write a heavy-duty

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:48,049
specification so you know if you weren't

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:49,880
writing text then there was a problem

00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:51,260
you know if you're coding that's that's

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,299
probably bad because you might be doing

00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,580
something wrong I said better to write a

00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:58,310
specification instead and talk about it

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,049
mm-hmm in order to do that it was

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,970
necessary then to change the UI to form

00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,450
what they called an i-team which have

00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:08,600
representatives a user experience QA

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:10,970
documentation they even allowed a few

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,560
developers in if you're lucky and it's

00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,260
here you sat down in a room although

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,290
this is difficult on the internet and

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,760
and worked up your specification and and

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,670
you know then had it approved in a very

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,829
formal process and this was to lead to

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:28,090
quality software you know I mean the end

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:30,170
goal of course was to improve quality

00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,579
unfortunately you know adding endless

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:33,890
process steps to change doesn't

00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:36,290
necessarily improve quality it turns out

00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,239
which means obviously I mean the obvious

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:40,250
reaction when you notice your process

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,500
isn't improving quality is to add more

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,640
steps I mean that there's this is what's

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,170
going to solve the problem right and

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,489
make it more difficult to change stuff

00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:52,459
and so on and so this is a bit of a

00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,079
problem in a junk in conjunction with

00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:55,640
that it was not as if there was a

00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,620
shortage of problems

00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,530
there really was a lot that needed

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,990
fixing the bug seemed to be everywhere

00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:05,600
and you know there was no no lack of

00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:09,140
people complaining about them but still

00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,780
changing things was quite difficult in

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,520
terms of a release cycle initially there

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,980
was a great resistance to having a short

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,919
release cycle because you couldn't push

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:21,079
a box set through the retail channel if

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:23,030
you had more than about one every 18

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,730
months or so say the conventional wisdom

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,730
went I'm so an 18-month development

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,230
cycle attractive as it is for those

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:34,040
people who don't like to get new bug

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:35,480
reports um it is a bit of a long thing

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,570
in an open source world on that time

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:40,700
we're releasing six monthly or so and so

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,200
what we did was we set up our aim branch

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:45,050
to backported all the nice features

00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,270
thank you from from a pan office into

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,130
another thing that was sort of open

00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,900
office so all of the Linux's were

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:53,150
shipping that because it was way better

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,010
like four years and years you know it

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,660
had all of the features that were going

00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:58,490
to come in the next thing but you know

00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,530
bug fixed and ready and you could

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:03,890
actually do it so that the route to

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,020
market which was a boxed product sort of

00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:07,910
died I mean you know pretty vigorously I

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:09,770
mean if you Sousa is probably still

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,200
doing it somewhere but you know I think

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:13,910
we sold it to someone else right um-hmm

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,890
but you know going into shops and buying

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:18,260
boxes it's going away of blockbuster you

00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,090
know it's a it's on a speedy downhill

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,740
decline so all of the Linux is were

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:25,340
using something wasn't really open

00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,620
office in addition to a massive process

00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:31,430
burden a release cycle was not helpful

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:34,340
and you know social problems but it's

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,169
also very necessary to retain control

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,270
and ownership of the code and you could

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,370
talk about this for hours but this is a

00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,500
picture of fedora contributions and

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,690
somewhere around here they drop the

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,370
requirement of a contributor license

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,039
agreement that you had to sign first and

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:50,539
send off this is the number of accounts

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,300
that are open with people contributing

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:54,590
stuff and this is time so i think i

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,140
think this graph by itself it's a pretty

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,360
impressive picture of what happens when

00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:01,160
you start to be open and starts you have

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,500
you know reciprocal licensing that you

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,360
accept other people accept and everyone

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,289
is on a level playing field rather than

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,240
having one special privileged

00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:15,189
company your organization that wants to

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,830
own and control everything hmm the

00:06:15,189 --> 00:06:19,930
governance there was a governance set up

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,159
to make the community happy the way the

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,259
governance was structured was quite

00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:24,819
interesting in itself so of course it's

00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:26,379
very important that the sponsoring

00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,149
organization you know start a vision had

00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:30,279
a guaranteed seat on the board so they

00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,439
have a guaranteed seat on board but in

00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,699
addition the vast majority of people on

00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:40,659
the board were elected by a slate of

00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:43,180
people appointed by sun.star official so

00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:45,550
and which were vast majority of these

00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,589
were employees so I mean the net result

00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,089
was there was one seat that you could

00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:51,729
potentially be elected for which was the

00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:53,289
quotes community seat on the board I

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:54,849
mean it sounds like a bad joke right i

00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,199
mean III don't know any of it these

00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:59,409
things happen a lot and the community

00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,449
seat was extremely gala therrien anyone

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,039
could vote for it like you know if you

00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,300
had only just turned up and actually I

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,099
didn't think there's even any kind of

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,659
admission process at all you just went

00:07:06,099 --> 00:07:08,969
to the website and you could vote for

00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:11,529
the who was going to be the community

00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:13,209
representative see so having put years

00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,490
of effort and work into trying to

00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:17,409
improve the project contribute cared my

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,899
voting representation was just the same

00:07:17,409 --> 00:07:21,490
as someone who went to the website you

00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,080
know that was their main contribution um

00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:26,680
so this is quite an extraordinary

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,019
governance and hmm certainly in tdf of

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,029
document foundation we make sure that no

00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:33,039
one organization control more than

00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:37,180
thirty percent of the votes anywhere

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,909
because I mean as just healthy so um

00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:41,680
this all went to build up a bit of a

00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:43,629
frustration problem i think the culture

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,430
is well described by you know a problem

00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,439
for every solution you know there are

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,969
you know I think that's a that's pretty

00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,559
much where we were you know any time you

00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:52,569
had a creative idea for how to improve

00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:54,819
things I like reducing the process

00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:58,269
button say you know there would be some

00:07:54,819 --> 00:08:00,459
horrible problem yeah you know I mean I

00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:01,779
let me don't don't let me go to too far

00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:03,129
overboard there were some wonderful

00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:04,779
people there in Hamburg you know some

00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:07,330
some great individuals who are charming

00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:09,999
and friendly who would even go and write

00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:11,589
the massive specification for you to try

00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:13,809
and help you get your stuff in you know

00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,969
who are sort of a firewall between the

00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:17,979
monstrous mess and individuals and they

00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:20,330
really worked hard you know these people

00:08:17,979 --> 00:08:22,280
trying to attract volunteer

00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,490
and get people involved and you know

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:27,319
some great friends from that time so

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,590
however the big picture one was one of

00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:34,250
significant problems and cultural I

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:36,709
guess corporate cultural issue so

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,990
eventually everything came to a head and

00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:40,190
we decided that this really couldn't go

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:42,740
on we were actually waiting around

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,990
hoping that when Oracle acquired this

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,000
division that things would get better

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:48,980
you know that they would they would kick

00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,459
its backside and something happened it

00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,990
turned out that wasn't likely so while

00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:55,579
everyone was going on a boat cruise to

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,750
the apron office you know the OpenOffice

00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:58,450
conference through a group of us that

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,040
went instead for private meal and

00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,140
discussed how we could solve this

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,089
problem and what we came up with was

00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:07,760
effectively Libre Office and so on the

00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:09,410
10th anniversary of openoffice a 10

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,110
years off it was promised to set up a

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,870
you know an independent nonprofit with

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,550
with a governance and so on which just

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:19,040
hadn't happened we decided we were going

00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:22,820
to do it anyway and invite everyone to

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,310
join of course so this is the 2011 slide

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,510
you know can you blame Oracle is it all

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:29,180
their fault and the answer is of course

00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,500
no you know basically you know we've

00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,050
been waiting 10 years we were patient

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,310
there is some real opportunities you

00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,529
know fantastic opportunities

00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:39,769
opportunities big ones for improvement

00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:41,540
right and really start a vision had

00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:43,430
significant autonomy they did what they

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,560
liked and they took they took the rap

00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,519
for it ultimately so you know we did

00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,199
this because we want to do the right

00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,540
thing not because we don't like anyone

00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:52,850
right and we'd love to have oracle

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,010
involved so then how do you launch a

00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,130
brand new project with you know with

00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:59,089
with significant reach how is it done

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,010
well it turns out there are a number of

00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,930
problems in this the first thing is you

00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,579
need a press release now writing press

00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,310
releases it's quite easy you know you

00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:09,709
just type with both fingers for double

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,209
the productivity and i discovered this

00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:13,459
actually recently you can speed up

00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:14,810
anyway um you just need to type faster

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:17,000
and your programs will be longer you

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,769
know it's wonderful anyhow and that the

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,880
problem is not the press release because

00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:21,800
that's easy to bribe the problem is

00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,860
getting people to back it right you need

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,970
people to sign up and we had souza in

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,339
one corner we had read her in another

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,790
corner the two main powers of you know

00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,140
putting actual investment into this but

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,860
each of them wanted the other to jump

00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,920
first

00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:38,450
you know after you know after you like

00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,910
this you know all a bit of a problem huh

00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:42,589
and so I don't know who remembers Jeremy

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:45,050
Allison but he's he's a cool guy you

00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,089
know and he he works with us Souza for a

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,829
long time good friend of mine and Chris

00:10:47,089 --> 00:10:50,870
DiBona of course at Google and they

00:10:48,829 --> 00:10:52,370
provided this just fantastic quote that

00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,290
broke the deadlock so it's like well

00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:56,300
Google's going why aren't you you know

00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:57,860
so you know google is proud to be a

00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,630
supporter of the documentation which

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,010
this time of course doesn't exist you

00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,680
know like we're just announcing it you

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:06,079
know so this is and you know so this

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,519
lead quite really actually enabled the

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,250
launching of the documentation it's

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,320
fantastic so of obviously on the other

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,260
side you know then Mauch Ostrovsky jam

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,399
one ball and Ford mark shuttleworth

00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:19,459
Richard Stallman gave us quite simon

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,810
phipps oasis in the office but various

00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:23,120
the people at the time when we could

00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,040
round up and encouraged to support us

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,480
which was great so we had a great press

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,920
release we get it put that out and yeah

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,390
and then hit'll they go right what so

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,450
you need all this in a marketing and

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,620
branding collateral right another time I

00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,990
was convinced that libre office was a

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,800
terrible name and the logo was

00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:44,600
absolutely awful um but it turns out

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,550
that what's important about a Lego is

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,990
not and well you know I didn't act I

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,250
mean I'm quite attached to it now maybe

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,480
I wear it a lot you know I think I've

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,130
probably got it good here somewhere you

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,010
know but it's not just me if you go to

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,269
look at the Wikipedia logo page

00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,860
wikipedia editors have a fantastic sense

00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:02,180
of humor because the three legos they

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,890
choose our documentation IBM right next

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,649
to it and and then some other random

00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,120
highly noisy logo yeah it turned out to

00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:11,209
be good very beautiful in its simplicity

00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:15,920
and kristoff no accuser is a hero so I

00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:16,760
retract my previous negative feedback so

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,740
then there's a whole lot of you know

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,230
being up all night and you know typing

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,550
web pages again very quickly with with

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,740
with several other people and git

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,089
repository ISM key mashing things

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:29,630
together with other people and you know

00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:30,890
also think eventually I'm pre briefing

00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:33,740
journalists you know it was great to

00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:35,839
have scissors PR support Red Hat's a PR

00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,490
support google prepared to brief people

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,170
and so on you need to go and reach out

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,360
and precede the story that something's

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,279
going to happen of course at this time

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,170
we invited Oracle as well to join and

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,640
get involved sadly due to various

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,850
reasons they they

00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,290
not to so launched and suddenly anyway

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,090
we're wanting people to get involved

00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,980
please you know come and help us in

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:57,200
other news is out there it's hot it's

00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,690
live everyone is interested to to get

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,710
involved and you know um we really need

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,450
people who are actually going to get

00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,340
stuck in and do stuff right because it's

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:06,350
all very well writing press releases at

00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,690
the end of the day the code is in

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,370
desperate need of improvement so we're

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,440
extremely pleased and actually we were

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:14,210
quite surprised to see suddenly this

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,760
huge spike of people that we'd never

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,450
seen before a committing code actually

00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,860
almost directly out of the box bang

00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,230
loads of people arrived that we hadn't

00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,060
seen before which is to me quite

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,470
exciting you know it almost validated

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,270
what we did that there was really

00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:31,010
hopefully that you can see the trend

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,950
going up i think we had nearly 3,000

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,780
commits in February which is which is

00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,240
pretty impressive are the links colonel

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:40,070
of course has more mozilla has more but

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,230
it's it's gettin it's gettin into the

00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,220
same orders of magnitude of you know

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,590
some of the really big really

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,820
established projects which is which is

00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,770
fantastic and the other thing you see is

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,130
just diversity of it all you know we

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:55,190
have mmm we have of course red hat &

00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:57,350
schuster now collabera we have a patchy

00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,960
which is I think this yellow a thing

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,580
here and in a various other people and

00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,830
multi-core where you know various people

00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:06,670
doing specific things and getting

00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,110
involved which is just quite cool and

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,900
when you look at individuals rather than

00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:14,780
volume of code contributions you know

00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,670
just the dominant body is the volunteers

00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,890
people that we never saw before the

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:19,940
project started there's another line for

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,200
people that we did see before the

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,300
storage study this green one is known

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,620
contributors I think is that right it's

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,020
on the bottom so they're still around

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,310
right it's it's not terrible but there's

00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:30,140
just a lot more people and of course

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:33,020
unfortunately Oracle you know chose to

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,590
leave I guess at this point but you know

00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:40,610
we kind of carried on which is great so

00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:42,020
yeah that's the picture there and of

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,120
course the news you know keep keeps

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,550
coming and lots of lots of marketing

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,230
opensuse conference provided one of the

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,200
first places for us to actually have a

00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:52,790
office meetup actually so this is a this

00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,290
is I think probably the first libre

00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,870
office at fest come mini conference

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,730
which was tacked onto other I think

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,920
Nuremberg it was something

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:02,600
this to you something was it was pretty

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,699
awesome anyway you guys free kindly

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,800
hosted us way back in the bidding in

00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:10,970
this is halston burns talking about the

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,380
future amazing so so there we are and

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,850
this is another slide from the Foss dem

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,110
launching it basically explaining why

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,540
we're doing that what we're doing we're

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,510
doing it right within a neutral and no

00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:22,250
code ownership aggregation you know

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,230
making a real free software project none

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:26,300
of this you know fake stuff you know we

00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:27,470
had the FSF and the OSI finally managed

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,389
to agree on something which was

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:31,430
supporting a Libra office which is great

00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:33,110
we had boycott novelle and novell

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,519
supporting it you know which is good you

00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:36,110
know right I honey that there's

00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:37,699
something these things tell you you know

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,579
that some something the time has come

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:42,589
you know a free desktop hosting it mixed

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:44,120
licensing and you know what the goal was

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:45,860
to make a beautiful office so you can

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,410
actually be proud of rather than kind of

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,029
embarrassed off you know Gus we're still

00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:51,560
hoping to achieve their goal but I

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,050
promise you if you go back to what was

00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,930
there in 2011 you'll be yeah much more

00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:59,389
embarrassed and so yeah and of course

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,370
ODF made it possible to to actually get

00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:04,819
there you know to to migrate with your

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,319
data so then you need lot solve you know

00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:08,990
sort of public outreach random

00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:11,389
conferences for stem talk booths

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,850
collateral freedom never tasted so sweet

00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:14,959
you know these terrible puns you know

00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,870
they get onto the back of everyone's

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,600
clothing before you know it the bags the

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,920
lanyards the USB keys with a software on

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,230
it so you don't have to download the git

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,699
repository and you can just get it get

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:27,440
it on your think the cakes you know I

00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:29,360
mean confectionery plays an important

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,100
part in Brazilian culture it seems you

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
know look at that you know and and and

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,860
so you know unless you have a cape

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,860
really brought us on it you just not

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:40,100
made it unpack fests left left and right

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,930
munich and freiburg at hamburg and quite

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,300
a lot of them in germany in japan we

00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,889
have people you know volunteers and of

00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:48,440
course you know it's somewhat difficult

00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,420
often to draw links to asia and you know

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,769
actually interact people with people in

00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,750
a very different times of these people

00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:55,970
sprung up they contributing code there

00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,709
they're setting up booze printing

00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,329
collateral none of this done by by nuts

00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:01,279
just you know we see the pictures right

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,139
which is amazing isn't it just really

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,780
really encouraging the enthusiasm and

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:09,230
the hard work going in from everywhere

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,030
it was fantastically encouraging so

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,079
governance here is the boring government

00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:15,620
slide let me show

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,939
how it works so basically to make sure

00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,939
that this works we have a meritocracy

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:22,309
it's necessary to have done something to

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,079
be able to vote in early profits I'm

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:25,490
sorry about that this was controversial

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,039
initially you know that you ought to

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,360
have contributed a certain amount of

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,950
code that you ought to make a commitment

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,899
to sticking with a project for a few

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,350
months three months we asked for a

00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:38,240
nominal commitment hmm but either way we

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,309
then select and review these people and

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,220
of course documentation evangelism all

00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,990
of these things count and so we have

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:47,059
these these members and they elect the

00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:49,250
membership committee that then approves

00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:52,630
them so the Sun circularity and all

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:55,010
these things and they like the board and

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:56,899
we have an advisory board who provide

00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,450
advice this has leaves of companies on

00:17:56,899 --> 00:18:00,919
it and companies are not entirely stupid

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:03,200
things sometimes you know they actually

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,929
have good people inside them and they

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,260
can provide you with good advice like

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:10,700
you know don't put it all in you know

00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:12,620
emerging country debt the money for

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,260
example right this kind of clever advice

00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:17,269
and they also important it point an

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,850
engineering steering committee there's

00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:22,100
quite a lot of engineering going on that

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:25,159
needs actually very minimal steering but

00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:27,049
we'll look at that so power is vested of

00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:31,309
course in the board legally responsible

00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,590
and but really that they're elected by

00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:40,039
the members who well everyone that does

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:42,980
stuff which is great um what do

00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,139
you--what not doc trashed yet no it's my

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,620
my button requires a big push for some

00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:49,519
reason anyhow I'm so ESC I I know Cesar

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,580
doesn't have one of these and it's

00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,799
decided not to um but we got pretty

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:57,440
bored of having IRC meetings in the in

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,240
the Sundays because I'm ioc meeting is

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,919
something that's so boring but I did I

00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,440
just fall asleep in this next I can't I

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,690
can't cope you know between each thought

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,460
there's a 20 second break and my brain

00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:09,380
is completely checked out by the time I

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,929
you know it maybe you could read the log

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:15,080
afterwards if you cared so we instead we

00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:18,200
have a phone-based meetings and we do

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,490
those weekly and it's relatively diverse

00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,880
I mean there's a whole load of different

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,830
companies involved in that um and we do

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,370
everything consensus-based so we argue

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,010
but

00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:29,900
in the end we agree one controversial

00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,200
decision we voted on ever which is when

00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:35,360
to have 4.0 so you know that's kind of

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,860
fun and it's packed with the right

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,660
people it has everyone you know that's

00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,730
doing that the key working QA user

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,680
experience development translation

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,630
whatever anything that's to do with the

00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,240
engineering release process libre office

00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:51,250
the people are there we publish minutes

00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:53,540
each week and yeah it seems to just work

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,130
which is which is pleasant as soon as we

00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:57,740
see some kind of flame war on a mailing

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,090
list because we tend to believe the

00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,679
mailing lists aren't a great place for

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,510
flame wars you know I mean this is very

00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:04,580
satisfying isn't it to get very feel

00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:06,770
very attacked and write lots of angry

00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,900
prose and if you're lucky you can then

00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,940
get angry again as you re read it before

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,440
you're sending it and then feel bad that

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,520
you're cutting out the harshest bits and

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,950
you know all this sort of thing if

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,990
you're really you know if you're ilion

00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:20,809
same mode but you know that the bile

00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:23,390
spewing flame wars we tend to think that

00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,250
they're not terribly constructive for

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:28,010
building a community feeling so as soon

00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:29,960
as soon as something pretty dodgy

00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,640
happens and you usually hope that

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,679
there's a decision involved I mean it's

00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:35,330
not just like you suck was no you suck

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,670
it's more like you suck because you

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:39,200
don't like this technical thing in a you

00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:42,410
suck because you do like it and so on

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,200
and so hopefully we'll say okay you know

00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,370
wave a flag will have this will discuss

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,770
it in the engineering steering committee

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,790
meeting and you two guys aren't actually

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,690
on the engineering steering committee

00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:53,120
meeting you know you're not actually

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,130
doing much so you can come to the

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,300
meeting and tell us about why it's so

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,790
important when we do this or do that

00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,200
right and it turns out that when you put

00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:03,770
people in a phone call and they can hear

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,540
each other and they tend to be less bile

00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,590
spewing for some reason and if you

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,210
listen to them and you ask them

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,220
questions and things often we can come

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:13,520
to a compromise that doesn't result in a

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,380
thousand male spew and a 15-month way to

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,530
know whatever right so we can make a

00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:22,010
decision hatefully compromises it

00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:23,840
doesn't always work about which right so

00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:26,720
you're shunting conflict off into a

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,320
better medium for conflict is helpful

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,059
for us so the advisory board you see the

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,170
lovely logo in the middle um we have all

00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:35,660
sorts of people here so this is the

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:39,170
Saudi Arabian government the immortal

00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:42,170
kacst that's the name of the Institute

00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,730
they make nuclear reactors and also

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,580
LibreOffice so you know you can see the

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:48,620
synergies Nemo is a representative of

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,060
the French government which is which is

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,040
straight whole load of inter-ministerial

00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,900
things obviously the FSF this is a

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,640
German nonprofit around at spi are the

00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:57,740
heroes behind debian that raise and hold

00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,540
money for us actually in the US and

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,000
other things i think most people have

00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,830
heard of this company AMD and Intel

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,930
which is encouraging aimed actually

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,640
investing a lot of money in development

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:11,000
of LibreOffice and improving it for

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:13,460
their Hardware souza mm-hmm collabera

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,020
lon ido and red hat so you know a good

00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,590
number of companies are supporting

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,490
because i say they provide advice

00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,630
actually one of the interesting things

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,890
if you're interested if you happen to

00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,140
run a company and you have you know

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,080
$10,000 you want to give us one of the

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:29,720
interesting things is that we have a

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,720
public approach of being positive about

00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,550
competing projects so you know I check

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,020
them out they're great you know mm-hmm

00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,420
however it's important to have a

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,740
realistic approach somewhere that

00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:42,110
actually measures and looks at all the

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,220
metrics and the heart you know the hard

00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,080
decisions we have to make and

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:47,780
competitive positions and so on and you

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,400
can't really have that in public no wait

00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,470
you can't have a nice thing probably and

00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,990
then do this as well so these guys get

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,370
to to suffer the hard analytics behind

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,440
the scenes and to some degree called us

00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,450
to account and measure progress in a way

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,550
that we can't really do without looking

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:04,460
like you know the swine's that we really

00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:05,840
are anyway there we go so the Libre

00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,150
Office conference we had three

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,560
conferences so far Paris as you see we

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,390
tried to enlarge the number of people by

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,950
a well-placed mirror you know this is

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,570
this is a very important strategy I

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,300
would recommend it to you um no no I'm

00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:22,580
not being mean I really um so the next

00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,990
conference was a German Federal Ministry

00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:26,960
of economics and Technology lovely

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,490
people nice building lots of and we're

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,440
getting slightly better at actually the

00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:33,140
idea of taking a photo I don't know this

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,700
one you know almost no one is looking at

00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,080
you know in the previous previous guy

00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,060
that you know what is happening here

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,980
this is not a conference photo um this

00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,540
one is a bit better you know like I mean

00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,760
there's still people arriving here who

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:45,460
haven't quite got there yet and most

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,540
looking those are people not in there

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,180
now this is getting there you know the

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,250
enthusiasm the you know the style but

00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,600
then that's Italy for you say where you

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,130
thank you for all the people there but

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,540
the good news is the fourth LibreOffice

00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:58,310
conference which will be our best yet

00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,840
because our conferences get better and

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,940
better in everything we do you know

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,580
kaisan you've heard about these Japanese

00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:06,650
people that get better and better um so

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,240
constant improvement in burn nearby you

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,970
could go it's going to be beautiful look

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,250
at it looks it looks nice um maybe fewer

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,530
castles than dubrovnik but i'm gonna

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,280
it's going to be great so September is

00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,390
our next conference please do come there

00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,770
in addition to actually making the

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,450
software it's nice that people started

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:24,950
to use it I mean you know be it would be

00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,540
fantastic to have a project like this

00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,160
with this excitement with no one using

00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:30,530
it but it's encouraging that there are

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,660
people using it so you know the small

00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:34,970
small migrations in government just

00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:38,480
looking at 11 sector you know Munich

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:41,270
using it copenhagen netherlands defense

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,060
valencia you know some quite encouraging

00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,890
numbers of deployment that but of course

00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:48,920
large numbers of individual users use it

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:50,300
and it's very hard to count them so for

00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,390
example you know i don't know how many

00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,190
you think there are on the linux desktop

00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,140
but the population grows by you know a

00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,530
billion each decade of something so you

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,300
know there's probably quite a lot it's

00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:04,250
those small percentage games the product

00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,290
managers love so much anyway building

00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:07,700
predictions of the future you know you

00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,410
only increase your small percentage by

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,090
very you know double it it still looks

00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,400
small but it's good for the numbers

00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:17,960
anyhow so um the global linux user base

00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:19,130
gives us maybe 35 million maybe which is

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,200
nice none of that's measured in this

00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,780
this is just the downloads and these

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,370
guys phone home for asking you know is

00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,050
there an update its erupting i want an

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,060
update what's new tell me is something

00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,910
you know if you got a new thing and we

00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,470
get a more than a million new IP

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:36,230
addresses so not once we've seen before

00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:38,150
once we've never seen before a million

00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,610
more than a million new unique IP

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:43,130
addresses every week which we're quite

00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,990
pleased about and this rate is you know

00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,060
double what it was a year ago and we

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:49,700
seem to be going up which is always

00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:53,990
encouraging this is 70 million or so on

00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:55,550
the vertical axis which is nice so but

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,810
more than that you know i'm quite apart

00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,120
from users getting getting developers

00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:01,310
involved i was pleased Carl Fogle is a

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,860
great guy and being heavily involved in

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,179
the Apache project route great book on

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,820
how

00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,470
to do open source software and initially

00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,480
tried to work with openoffice back in

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,190
the day basically couldn't you know it

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,929
was really really hard and he now says

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:15,490
quote sleeper office is ridiculously

00:26:13,929 --> 00:26:17,889
easy to build you know it actually

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:19,360
compiles so I mean this is usually a

00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:22,240
good step in getting people into project

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,249
compiling a step one I'm so you know

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,629
going to make ports we can now compile a

00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:27,970
massive parallel if you want a

00:26:25,629 --> 00:26:29,649
supercomputer to be tested we can

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,070
destroy your supercomputer for you you

00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:34,330
know we can compile 10,000 wide C++

00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,100
files something like that you know so we

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:38,379
pre process and build all of our

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:40,139
generated code and then you know we can

00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:43,809
compile just massively massively wide

00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:46,450
which is pretty good so in about 15

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:48,580
minutes on a beast of a machine you know

00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,679
with with with lots of CPUs you can go

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,659
from clean to having a working libre

00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,059
office and I'm just changing the culture

00:26:52,659 --> 00:26:56,320
to say look we want you to be

00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:58,029
contributing it's really important you

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,619
know and so we have a thing called easy

00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:02,440
hacks that makes easy to get involved

00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:05,169
you know just doing simple stuff we have

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,610
a code overviews documentation we have

00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:08,740
training slide where to get people

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:10,509
involved and previously when people

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:13,929
built slide we're about open office

00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:15,759
often the emphasis was basically a mac

00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:17,590
is mo your machismo you know it's

00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,909
impossible you can't do it Hey look at

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,249
this dependency graph it's so

00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:22,929
complicated no mortal can understand it

00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:24,850
it turns out it's actually not that

00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:27,159
complicated there's just really bad

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:29,139
graphs so with a bit of better graph

00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,570
work and dependency generation we can

00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:34,210
now actually show the not unreasonably

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,129
simple complicated structure of

00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:39,070
LibreOffice which is clicking William

00:27:36,129 --> 00:27:42,309
link that's silly huh let's try not

00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:44,259
clicking on the PDF perfect and we start

00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:46,539
to do features so interoperability is a

00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:48,610
pain so let's embed the fonts fonts or a

00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:50,830
real problem so kindly funded by the

00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,289
open-source business alliance everyone

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,700
wants to make a a slideshow with massive

00:27:53,289 --> 00:27:57,460
images in it you know that 100 mega

00:27:54,700 --> 00:28:00,309
pixel camera you are lusting after this

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,570
is a 1 megapixel screen right so when

00:28:00,309 --> 00:28:03,789
you project you're going to just scale

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,769
it down to you know a fraction of its

00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:09,190
size using your GPA which is the best

00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:10,629
thing you know so anyhow now you've got

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,009
a you know 100 megapixel image you want

00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:14,200
to put lots of them in a slideshow to

00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:15,970
make everything ultra-efficient you know

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,440
anyway so there we go you can easily do

00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:19,360
it you can even rotate images

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,220
inward writer now which has been a

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,559
feature will be missing for years you

00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,870
know beautiful new graphing things base

00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:27,759
improvements are we got a sidebar from

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,799
from IDM and apache openoffice which

00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,769
which is nice it's actually not even

00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:35,679
experimental in 4.2 and lots of other

00:28:32,769 --> 00:28:38,470
integration things gstreamer better

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,539
searching libre office for two pretty

00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,549
shells so you can see your recent

00:28:40,539 --> 00:28:45,279
documents and thumbnails of them at

00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:49,269
android remote as i was telling wiki

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:51,549
earlier the blue z5 revolution we've

00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,899
only just caught up with and not it not

00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:53,980
in a way that works with suspend and

00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,330
resume so you know we've just got

00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,549
bluetooth roommates working beautifully

00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,820
on linux because they still work on

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:03,159
Windows and Mac and the API was

00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,330
radically broken underneath us with no

00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:06,580
one to come and help fix it so we've

00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:08,649
mostly fixed that but the client is now

00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:11,559
more beautiful to it even has this kind

00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:13,509
of laser pointer stuff so you can use

00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,419
your thumb as a laser pointer slightly

00:29:13,509 --> 00:29:19,450
bigger than the laser but it's quite

00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:21,460
pretty Google Drive integration pretty

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,500
conditional formatting there's a whole

00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,200
lot of heavy lifting stuff going on

00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:29,279
paying down decades of technical debt in

00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,139
calc I suggest a huge team here um

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,970
turning calc from this this thing that's

00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:36,940
highly object-oriented every cell was an

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,289
object so each of them looked like this

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:41,470
with this stack of different you know

00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:43,240
types and derived derived classes and so

00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:45,549
on and it says this is a disaster area

00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,830
so instead now we have a raise of flat

00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,240
doubles which is basically what you want

00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:52,809
down your column to do any fast

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,789
arithmetic and blocks of similar similar

00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:57,100
things I'm previously we would duplicate

00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:59,320
every formula say you fill a column for

00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:02,259
the formula each one of those would

00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,029
duplicate every formula twice like its

00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:06,009
passed into tokens each of them

00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:08,049
allocated separately just tons of memory

00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:10,149
wastage turning this into you know

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:11,919
something simple like this helps us to

00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:15,220
see our dependency structures better

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:19,240
calculate more quickly and so pretty new

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:22,120
icons Firebird database integration so

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,009
instead of some horrible java java thing

00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,700
you know we have this room should be

00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:29,409
nice a c++ database new features open

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,970
external interoperability everyone hates

00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:33,309
losing data in the document

00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,690
or it appearing to be broken or when you

00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:37,270
round through a bit so just improving

00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,340
round-trip things we don't understand it

00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:41,200
open xml we keep internally now and we

00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,090
start spitting them out again to repair

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,130
your file as we save it so it may not

00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:47,559
look perfect in your office I'm having

00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,900
edited it it comes back like it should

00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:53,799
have been right which is pretty cool I'm

00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:55,450
bcp 47 aha so actually this part of the

00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:56,980
world might be interested in this so

00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,350
there are some languages that have two

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,990
orthographies Cyrillic or Latin for

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:03,789
example for the same language this we

00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:07,600
couldn't represent before and now we can

00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:10,270
bcp 47 tags we can do that which is

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,250
great a man year of work for something

00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:15,330
that's used in you know just this

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:18,429
location so that's great um what's that

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,919
in Serbia you're right not in Croatia

00:31:18,429 --> 00:31:23,260
and Serbia but it's near here right yeah

00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:25,720
i think it's near here I mean my girls

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,520
stood geography is yeah pretty pretty

00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:30,850
pretty tendentious we are near australia

00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,350
right perfect um important more legacy

00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,360
mac document side so i'll talk a bit

00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:36,100
more about this in a minute keynote

00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,890
filter which is quite good getting three

00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,770
menu integration improving you I so I'll

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,809
lay out a switching to a decent you I

00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:44,789
where she's starting to nearly get there

00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:47,610
when this number gets to the bottom

00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:50,799
we're done which is pretty cool so um

00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:52,960
new trend lines actually this radical

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,280
idea of unit testing one of the

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,110
unpleasant things about working in

00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,419
OpenOffice was the disdain the

00:31:56,110 --> 00:32:00,880
professional programmers had for the

00:31:58,419 --> 00:32:03,610
unwashed masses like myself who were

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,500
hackers y'know non professional

00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,610
programmers well since we started we've

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,799
started doing all these non professional

00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:11,260
things like writing unit tests which

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,480
were not really there before and and you

00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,010
know all of that terrible stuff and and

00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,960
so you know suddenly we're starting to

00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:19,150
get much more of the code test it every

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,309
time you know we break a document is

00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,770
broken on import will write an import

00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:25,990
test for it and we'll fix the bug having

00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:28,510
check your test fails I would then

00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:30,700
re-export that document re-import it and

00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,169
run the test again so we're confident

00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,020
that it makes it through save load re

00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:37,740
safe reload and so on so lots increasing

00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:40,149
numbers of round trip interop testing

00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,490
we're pretty excited about opencl right

00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:44,279
so i don't know if you've read many

00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,720
graphics libraries

00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:48,190
multimedia libraries but when you get

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,200
down under the hood what you discover is

00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:52,419
all of them have these hard hand coded

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,130
assembler stuff their inner loops you

00:32:52,419 --> 00:32:55,570
know and it's cool it makes people I

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,909
quickies job beautiful because every

00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,409
time there's a new cpu architecture you

00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,730
have to go right more hand care to the

00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:04,929
assembler which is full employment

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:07,059
scheme it really is good you know and it

00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:08,380
gives some great wins as well all you've

00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:10,330
got to do is slightly tweaked the CPU

00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:13,899
and you know this NK December is no

00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:15,159
longer as efficient so um opencl solves

00:33:13,899 --> 00:33:17,679
this problem you write in a relatively

00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:19,360
nice see like language like a fragment

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,429
shader and then it will compile it for

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,250
exactly your CPU you know with exactly

00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:27,909
your weird sse3 Prescott native

00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:29,350
whatever's and kinetic live rocks anyway

00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:31,690
you can read a bit about what AMD is

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:33,820
doing with HSA are sharing sharing

00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,260
memory and so on and look at it it makes

00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,850
such readable code when you also

00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,230
generate it you know from formula I

00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,720
don't know how much opencl you've read

00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:42,700
but uh mmm and so it's quite interesting

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,080
for a longer some you know you can get

00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,090
this stuff on under the hood it's

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,419
compiled and guess what it's even faster

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:51,220
which is amazing isn't it um so there we

00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:53,860
go unfortunate say much faster you need

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,330
a log scale on the bottom so you know

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,210
when it when it haves here that's that's

00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:59,950
doing pretty well right but good sir

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,919
it's pretty nice so between 30 and five

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:06,399
hundred times faster versus the legacy

00:34:02,919 --> 00:34:07,960
the old style calculation on Kaveri so

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,399
that the you know we kind of encouraged

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,899
by that sort of thing what else

00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,060
paralyzed leading so if you've got lots

00:34:10,899 --> 00:34:15,609
of data on to crunch you want to elite

00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,679
it in parallel ring quicker get it into

00:34:15,609 --> 00:34:20,169
the machine XML is not very quick to

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,790
pass so we split the passing from the

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:24,460
interpreting of it and populating the

00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:26,470
data sheets to pieces and you get

00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:28,780
effectively fifty percent of the work in

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:32,560
each it's quite interesting i'm sooo

00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,060
yeah we can now use 16 32 threads as

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,919
many as you like really we're even

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,270
compiling to open CL while you're

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:38,530
leading in the background which is

00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,750
pretty awesome and as another thread

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:43,810
that just draws your progress bar which

00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,639
is which is important um so you can turn

00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:47,290
that on and does it work well there's a

00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:49,960
reference here I don't know if you can

00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:52,179
guess what the reference is it's another

00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,069
industry standard program used for

00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:55,780
spreadsheets and shorter is better we

00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:57,640
don't beat the the reference in every

00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,910
case but in some cases and again this is

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,000
a lot

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,950
scale we're doing pretty well you know

00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,260
so this was the old stuff this is the

00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:07,599
new stuff and this is the reference and

00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,660
so you can see in some cases we can load

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,849
xlsx spreadsheets are better than the

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:17,319
reference which is encouraging anyhow

00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:19,690
say we've also done a huge amount of

00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:21,640
work on trying to liberate a legacy file

00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,260
formats or proprietary file format so

00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,299
people can actually get their data into

00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,670
ODF and be confident it'll still be

00:35:25,299 --> 00:35:28,869
there so and we even set up a

00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:31,930
sub-project now look at this beautiful

00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:33,700
logo for it you know inspired by a TD

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,500
evidence is part of a part of a tdf

00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,839
project but sort of separate because the

00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,359
KDE project use a number of these pieces

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,880
can own a project to you know people

00:35:40,359 --> 00:35:44,380
around the place scribus uses some of

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,539
these filters and we want to be in a

00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,760
plural we you know people don't want a

00:35:46,539 --> 00:35:49,990
sport libre office maybe but they're

00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:52,150
they're eager to support these filters

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,240
so yeah publisher works keen a vizio

00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:57,099
loads of obsolete binary formats mac

00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:59,380
writer three or something you know you

00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:01,930
never heard of it but we do it in a

00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,700
happy word mmm ebook you know free hands

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,549
and just lots and lots more of this

00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,250
stuff in progress reverse engineering

00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:10,599
horrible binary file formats what's the

00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,130
future like all the future is made while

00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:14,380
everyone to tell you that so here's a

00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,539
picture 0 for android version tiled

00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:20,039
rendering to make a very slick fast

00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:23,619
zooming and panning and pinching and

00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:25,270
operations quick on tablets collabera

00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,680
productivity just a quick pitch about

00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,049
this and i'm nearly done you'll be

00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:32,410
pleased to know how am i doing for time

00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:34,240
I'm good no I'll slow down perfect so um

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:35,770
collaborative this is the shameless

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,109
corporate plug feel free to leave now

00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:41,170
see this guy integrity leaving and the

00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:43,690
core plugin I love it and keep going um

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:45,010
so I can I productivity is the company I

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,099
now work for it's a subsidiary of

00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:51,849
collabera and I would argue we are a a

00:36:48,099 --> 00:36:53,260
the leading open-source consultancy we

00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:55,270
have a mission which is to make open

00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,859
source kick-ass liking it yet that's our

00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:59,710
mission you know it's not to enrich our

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:01,720
shareholders or two I guess we want to

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,490
make our employees happy too but our

00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,799
primary mission is to make open source

00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:07,440
succeed as a methodology and you know

00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:10,809
get it deployed everywhere I

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,290
productivity has 12 certified liberals

00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:13,690
developers

00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,910
pretty good we're kind of the place to

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,680
come and we fix problems for people we

00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:19,840
implement new features we maintain do

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:22,930
long-term support and so on and the team

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:24,880
was spun out of Souza I guess six seven

00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:28,570
of us was spun out of Souza back in the

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,250
day and we're now 14 um Cesar really

00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:32,170
needed a focus I mean you know you can't

00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,940
do everything well it turns out you need

00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:36,880
to focus on doing some things are

00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:38,230
brilliantly and Libre Office had all

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,240
this great potential you know I mean

00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:43,260
that there are lots of areas where it

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:46,750
can grow but primarily they're not linux

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,970
why linux on the desktop sadly their

00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,370
windows they're android/ios there you

00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:53,400
know the cloudy something or others but

00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:58,060
this is not a terribly great match for

00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,070
suz's business honestly and I think this

00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:02,770
was really the best possible outcome you

00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,110
know spinning the team out rather than

00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:07,030
redeploying everyone was really the best

00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:09,040
possible outcome given the circumstances

00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:11,710
given the need for Souza to focus which

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,120
is a genuine you know business need it's

00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:17,080
not something that's optional you know

00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,210
you have to do it I think I think this

00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,730
really was the best option for Souza and

00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:23,140
you know sometimes maybe in the opensuse

00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:24,760
community you can wander around thinking

00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,770
and it does souza care about community

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,270
you know do they actually you know when

00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:31,420
the rubber hits the road do they care

00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:32,890
and through this process I was just

00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,780
amazing a privilege to work with you

00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:37,240
know Ralph and Nils and Gerald's and all

00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:39,460
the people in the senior end of scissor

00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,560
and be just amazingly impressed by their

00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,780
commitment to doing what was right at

00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,300
least for my community and I assume this

00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,570
applies to every every community out in

00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,800
fact I'm convinced of it so until until

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,810
the rubber hits the road you don't see

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,310
it but I saw it with a vengeance and

00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:56,110
these guys did the right thing so really

00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:57,340
kudos to the only guy here is young

00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:01,000
Weber so you can buy him a beer

00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:03,400
afterwards a few of you okay if you want

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,530
to um but you know it it was not an

00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,900
ideal ideal experience but it was I

00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,400
think incredibly impressive from the

00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,520
point of view caesars integrity and

00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,560
doing doing the right thing so yeah so

00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,270
here we are the conclusions are libre

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,150
office continues to grow and hopefully

00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,130
execute we are changing constantly we

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,170
like new things you know there are new

00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,820
ways of doing things that are better we

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,050
want to do them right so you know maybe

00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,390
have some ideas maybe you can get

00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:30,520
involved you're more than welcome to get

00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:31,870
stuck in to become a key member of the

00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,300
community and hey you know shape the

00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,670
future of office productivity you know

00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,800
we have a market interesting product

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,440
that the moves other products you know

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,240
we can see people adopting in other

00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,410
products are features shortly after

00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,850
their we're doing them so you know if

00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,520
you want to influence the the world

00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:50,800
office market we can we can do that

00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,990
together um arcade and feature sets much

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,250
better we are very diverse there are

00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,310
lots of companies and individuals

00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,990
supporting and thank you for help I mean

00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:00,550
an open Cesar has been a key part of the

00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:03,400
story caesars invested a lot in the

00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:04,810
project you know and and you've done

00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:06,360
conferences and things together thank

00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,740
you for your help and your support

00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:11,380
ultimately you know there's no way that

00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:13,240
I can do anything by myself we as a team

00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:15,760
can do it without your support and

00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:17,410
remembering our brand you know you know

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,360
it's a they say about Mozilla you know

00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:21,550
it's it's said missoula it's pronounced

00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,900
Firefox or something rain or whatever

00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,070
but you know what I'm saying it's

00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,650
pronounced libre office these days

00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,690
that's that's all I say um so get people

00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:30,490
excited about free software get involved

00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:33,280
and help us we'd love to have you work

00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:35,920
with us and any questions we were now at

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,330
the end yeah I have the microphone I'm

00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:50,920
Yvonne you possible thank you thank you

00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:52,510
you'd be very patient be a good question

00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,730
wiki cuz i have the embarrassing photos

00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:56,770
nearby yeah okay I'll bear that in mind

00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,620
yes so I'd say when you set this up and

00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:01,270
started there was a how sure were you

00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:03,640
that all those contributors were going

00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,930
to turn up how scary was it going do you

00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,250
think everyone's going to join toys this

00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:08,320
year a full flower in his face and will

00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,540
look silly yeah so when you consider we

00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:14,680
were up against some pretty significant

00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:16,480
entrenched opposition and yeah you know

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,190
we had a hundred and some person company

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,800
of full-time engineers we were as

00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:24,070
effectively soft for king it was a bit

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,720
concerning and in subsequently when

00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,640
another large company and got involved

00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,170
with support supporting that to you know

00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,970
you're looking at hundred billions of

00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,190
dollars companies that you're competing

00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:36,040
against and effectively winning against

00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,530
which is slightly surprising on one

00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,910
surface on the

00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:40,500
other end you know the there are

00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:42,420
remarkably few people in the world that

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,260
actually do the work you know there are

00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,760
a huge number of people are very

00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,130
interested in talking about it but

00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,870
actually doing it is another thing and

00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,880
luckily many of the people that actually

00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,890
did stuff like all these linux

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,910
distributions all of the packages we

00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,190
knew would come with us they're our

00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:57,900
friends we've worked with them you know

00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:59,910
red hair we were just much better on

00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:01,110
linux so we were confident that all of

00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:04,500
linux would come and then it's really

00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:07,140
about brand I mean the sad thing is that

00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:08,910
we have a great office suite you know

00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,350
for all engineers in this room you need

00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:13,110
to go and look at the relative download

00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:15,180
numbers here because really brand you

00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:16,920
know is driving people to buy something

00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,630
you know that is sort by you know

00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,070
download something this this inference

00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:22,380
is still a challenge they're growing our

00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,150
windows user base and brand awareness so

00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,070
anything you can do to help is

00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,960
appreciated but yeah I mean I was the

00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:29,400
only real one in the boards that truly

00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,130
believed we would get a lot of

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,560
developers I was pleasantly surprised by

00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,780
how well we did some of the other people

00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,870
like whoa you know but what is going on

00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:42,780
here so so yeah it was very frightening

00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:44,550
and it turned out well so thank thank

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,830
God you know I I didn't its downfall

00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,510
great ability but I do think there was a

00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:50,670
moment there where it was just the right

00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:53,910
thing to do you know like I say boycott

00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:56,220
novella FL FSF and the ER thought you

00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:58,770
know there was just a lot of support and

00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:02,730
goodwill from many years so yeah it's

00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:05,570
exciting Andrew I'll repeat your

00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,570
question just different

00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:17,619
mm-hmm so when setting up tdf what were

00:43:13,809 --> 00:43:21,819
the driving factors for you of you know

00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:25,239
setting up in Germany or you know it etc

00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:27,880
Robin doing an EVO all doing it before I

00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:32,079
1c in the US or whatever I mean what

00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:35,199
right what drove your your choice yes

00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,859
actually see politics is something like

00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:41,140
a sausage machine and it doesn't perhaps

00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:42,759
reflect well to look to review carefully

00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,219
at what's going on in the sausage

00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:48,670
machine but let's lift the lid very very

00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:50,920
quickly before we shut it again so the

00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,109
best corporate legal advice said don't

00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,809
incorporate in Germany like you know if

00:43:53,109 --> 00:43:58,180
you asked the international lawyers the

00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:00,519
someone with someone else they said go

00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:04,569
for a common law jurisdiction the USA or

00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:06,249
the UK I was in the UK we would kept not

00:44:04,569 --> 00:44:08,799
incorporating in Germany like there was

00:44:06,249 --> 00:44:10,449
a very long delay in this process and at

00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:13,689
some stage it came to a head and I said

00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:15,339
to my co board members to be look you

00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:18,880
know we need a deadline we've got to do

00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:20,619
this if we don't do it in six weeks we

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,469
will set one up in the UK anyway right

00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:25,089
go for it and one of the problems is in

00:44:23,469 --> 00:44:26,709
the Germany you need fifty thousand

00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:28,529
euros which you just keep in the bank

00:44:26,709 --> 00:44:31,329
for a foundation to set up a foundation

00:44:28,529 --> 00:44:34,329
you keep 50,000 euros on body is today

00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:36,039
and a negative real rate of interest so

00:44:34,329 --> 00:44:37,689
you need to get you need to go to people

00:44:36,039 --> 00:44:39,039
and say please give me fifty thousand

00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:40,929
euros and they say what will you do with

00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:43,319
it and you say we will put it in the

00:44:40,929 --> 00:44:45,880
bank where it will become less valuable

00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:47,439
right and probably be invested in

00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,119
microsoft shares with it right i mean

00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:51,219
that's the reality of international

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,549
banking right and this is i thought was

00:44:51,219 --> 00:44:55,989
a hard sell anyway so the ultimatum was

00:44:54,549 --> 00:44:57,369
given look you know six weeks anyway so

00:44:55,989 --> 00:45:00,339
that the call went out then you know

00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:02,170
donate us money we need money to create

00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:03,939
a foundation and germany i was convinced

00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:06,160
it wouldn't happen and in the first

00:45:03,939 --> 00:45:07,989
three weeks or something we raised 50000

00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,910
euros in subsequent three weeks we

00:45:07,989 --> 00:45:11,469
raised I don't know it some day we had

00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:14,709
easily enough and say my cunning plan

00:45:11,469 --> 00:45:16,929
and it was completely stymied and so we

00:45:14,709 --> 00:45:18,750
set up in Germany oh and you know that

00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:19,740
there are pros and cons of every juris

00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,350
addiction there are great things about

00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,660
Germany and there are less less positive

00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:26,160
things but there's no really there's

00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,930
nobody right on so i would suggest that

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,340
you use an EV instead of a stiff tongue

00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:35,880
generally if you count so who who gave

00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:37,470
you that legal advice of go here go

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,480
there don't do this don't do that I mean

00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:41,580
it came from a very large blue chip

00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:47,090
American company who was at the time

00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:49,170
supportive yeah yeah yeah um see I mean

00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,760
one of the things I didn't present here

00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:52,440
is our financial picture today so we

00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,510
don't have a Mazzilli style governs in

00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,660
the mozilla style governance wareham the

00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:59,250
board is elected by you know tenure they

00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,780
they have been there for a long time and

00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,460
also by another key criteria that they

00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,020
haven't made a donation six years ago to

00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,910
someone we don't like today you know so

00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:07,410
that those are the critical factors and

00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,340
the Mozilla project but they do have you

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:10,220
know hundreds of millions of dollars

00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:13,050
coming in which they then spend on

00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:15,300
development we don't have that we have

00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:18,240
may be approaching a million dollars

00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,950
worth of donations from a very diverse

00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,020
set of contributors advisory board

00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:23,430
members you saw their contribute but

00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:26,490
large numbers of people contribute as

00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:29,400
they download they donate ten dollars 20

00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:31,500
euros 15 euros this little thing but it

00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,110
all adds up and a million downloads a

00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:36,810
week they don't have to give very much

00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:38,400
over 52 weeks you are you know actually

00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:39,960
really support project and because of

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,640
that we can employ an executive director

00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:43,620
for an effin burger of release engineer

00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:46,350
who does all the releasing QA engineer

00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:50,270
another half a QA engineer certification

00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:53,130
program various other things PR and dumb

00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,870
website developers occasionally when we

00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:56,940
need them a song so that gives us a huge

00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:00,060
flexibility some significant financial

00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:02,040
reserves and I hope some depth and if we

00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:07,050
need to spend money we can when we want

00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:09,650
to good question any other good

00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:09,650
questions ah

00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:18,580
hello elope how do you see the future

00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:24,640
with the other say open office product

00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:27,100
there is isn't who I don't know um see

00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:28,360
you know you saw the volume of code that

00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:30,510
we incorporate from there on our

00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,150
contributor graph in terms of commits

00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:37,000
there are differences in between between

00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,800
styles of committing obviously oh you

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,200
know I just you know wish them all the

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,330
best really happy and I we would love to

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,740
have their cage in our project will be

00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,910
great to work more constructively with

00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:48,970
them personally I think it's a bit of a

00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,620
waste to have two projects um but yeah I

00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:52,870
mean let's see let's see this does

00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,520
everything to play for um you know they

00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,290
have a very valuable brand which we

00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:00,280
collectively as a community spent years

00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:02,340
building and that they control and it

00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:05,710
was was sad to see that happen I think

00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:08,080
so for the time being you see at least

00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:10,600
two projects existing together at the

00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,340
same time absolutely I think that's I

00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:16,000
think that's likely for what and they

00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:18,220
check them both out you know hmm so let

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,100
me follow up with another question why

00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:24,160
am the choice of Licensing especially

00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:28,150
the NPR so that's a great question the

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:31,090
MPL is a weak copyleft license it's a

00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:33,690
very weak copyleft license such that a

00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:36,550
large blue chip company that we know of

00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:38,710
is actually of able to use that license

00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:40,300
unable to distribute their proprietor

00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:43,480
under proprietor products of the npl is

00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,910
effectively so weak as a copyleft if you

00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,350
have contributed your code back then you

00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:50,410
can ship under whatever license you like

00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:51,910
your binaries so it's basically focused

00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,760
on getting people to contribute their k

00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:57,040
back and after that all bets are off now

00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,690
it's a gross simplification if you want

00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,760
a ship libre office under an Apache

00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:03,550
License the binaries you can do that

00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:07,150
today and customers tend to consume

00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:08,350
binaries not source code so our concern

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:12,010
was really to ensure that people

00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:14,140
contribute back but not maybe constrain

00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:16,210
the binaries as much as say a stronger a

00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:19,570
copyleft license like the GPL or the

00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:21,290
lgpl would do so it's kind of a

00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,850
compromise

00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,770
licensed that's designed to be

00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:27,410
attractive to other people and includes

00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,910
as many as possible and why a copyleft

00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:30,530
license that's a really good question

00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,870
personally I'm a big believer in the

00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:35,870
copyleft for its community building

00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:38,120
properties we have many people who

00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:39,920
contribute to libre office and it's

00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:41,720
pretty clear when you join that you're

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,700
expected to contribute your changes I

00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:46,040
mean it's there in the license but it's

00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:47,990
there in the culture and that's

00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,090
important and sometimes you know we sell

00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:52,220
consulting so I have some guy that wants

00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:53,870
to invest say fifty thousand euros in

00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:56,270
Lieber office and he wants to do it

00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:59,570
almost altruistically like I want this

00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:01,610
feature for my product but I'm really

00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,350
really concerned that other people don't

00:50:01,610 --> 00:50:05,630
take it turn it into something

00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:07,100
proprietary and not contribute back you

00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,380
know if I'm going to put stuff in I want

00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,210
to get their changes to I want to work

00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:13,100
together with other people and you get

00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:15,020
that any mail it's like well you know

00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:16,160
it's really important to us that it's

00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,320
like this and I say well that's fine

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,840
that's how Libre Office is set up this

00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:22,640
is how a license does that we agree with

00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:25,400
you you know this is how it should be

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,480
people collaborating together and so if

00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,340
you want to do a proprietary thing on

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,560
the side that's fine but the chord

00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:32,540
changes we want we won't contribute back

00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:35,000
so I think it's a key tool to build

00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,820
community um it's a key tool to make the

00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,020
situation clear and yeah like why do i

00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:43,760
do anything different is that yes level

00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:46,760
I have to admit I'm not very familiar

00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:50,270
with the npl itself okay so um actually

00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:55,280
I was thinking whether the lgpl was sown

00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:57,170
Lee a shallow well Seychelle for people

00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,450
or to attract people and say well look

00:50:57,170 --> 00:51:01,940
at the lgpl but in fact you know it's

00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:05,150
the MPO i think the reality is you're

00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:07,430
right to a degree um so the MPL is

00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:09,800
actually quadra license but i think a

00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,750
corporation the wants to be evil would

00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,340
use the weakest choice of license and so

00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:15,500
I think the MPL represents the maximum

00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:20,030
extreme of how far we're willing to

00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:21,590
compromise that yeah so but the MPL is a

00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:24,770
quad license so for various reasons

00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:28,640
which you know too tedious to go into

00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:31,790
it's it's a lgpl it's GPL and it's an a

00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:33,230
GPL license so any MPL code you can turn

00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:37,070
into these other licenses

00:51:33,230 --> 00:51:39,950
okay so it's yeah pick you pick your

00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:41,540
license yeah all right cool one more

00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:45,680
question perfection okay and then we can

00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:48,650
get a first so you talked about branding

00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:51,830
job then you talk about community so

00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:55,400
from what I can see other than big

00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:57,680
conferences like false demo in local

00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,290
conferences you don't have any community

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,930
talk commute not only talks from the

00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:06,430
community that's well I mean so how is

00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:08,780
this working for you I mean so keep in

00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:10,820
the state that you have to strengthen

00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:13,910
branding your branding and stuff like

00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:16,369
that I don't see any talks of you around

00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:18,830
for LibreOffice at least in universities

00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:21,800
because I love to read programs of other

00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:23,990
conferences so yeah yeah yeah it's a

00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:25,520
great question um I'm primarily a

00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:27,950
developer if you want to go and talk

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,350
about the prophus at conferences have my

00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:32,150
slides they're all CC 0 we can help with

00:52:30,350 --> 00:52:34,190
funding if you need to travel to places

00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:35,690
if you want to promote your office with

00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:39,560
stickers and stuff we can send you

00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:42,560
collateral it's not a problem one of the

00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:45,710
things we are slightly averse to is

00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:48,560
handing out job titles so in the open

00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:51,410
office days there was rampant job title

00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:53,060
handing out so Luis Suarez pots would

00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,380
get around the world appointing blessing

00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:56,570
people laying his hands on them and

00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:59,030
saying you are now the ambassador of the

00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:01,640
official ultra project lead ambassador

00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:05,060
you know and um generally we don't do

00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:06,710
that we try and avoid titles so if

00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:09,260
someone wants to do something like that

00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:11,270
do somethings arms that send you emails

00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,130
and you'll appear in lectures and you'll

00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,630
be you know yeah on the website and

00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:16,280
become a member and whatever and you're

00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:19,310
most welcome to promote early groups of

00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:22,010
course maybe it's your geography but you

00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:23,630
know we do we do promote libreoff is

00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:24,800
quite quite heavily the other thing is

00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,970
that there are only a certain number of

00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,460
developers so in terms of attracting

00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:30,890
students you know make me we have a

00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:33,530
hundred committers a month and entering

00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:35,300
people is hard this question it was sent

00:53:33,530 --> 00:53:37,130
to me by email by some guys from some

00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:39,500
universities I want to talk about

00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:42,770
liberals because at least in greek

00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:45,530
universities teachers don't even know

00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:46,660
liberal perfect well no tell you

00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:50,709
all professor

00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:50,709
