	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,980
we're good to go then I think we'll just

00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,769
get started so is it cake and now i'm

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,719
going to talk about katie going places

00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:18,690
obviously that cake was written with a k

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:22,800
right so um that's about me and that's

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:27,859
live in berlin with my wife and dog

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,210
popcorn and camilla in the other order

00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:33,120
it work for unclad this community

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,910
manager i'll spend a few slides on

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,540
uncloudy in a few minutes I also do que

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,550
te marketing and promo and I'll help out

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,890
and the geek goes a little bit with some

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,600
writing here and there and of course I

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,910
love hugs now a few slides on clouds

00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,370
I'll have talked about it actually later

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,050
today but if you can't make it because

00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,850
there's other more interesting stuff

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,370
during that talk words I can totally get

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:03,660
then you know this should give you the

00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:06,600
basics and it's 2014 and most of our

00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,200
data is in the clouds right and we've

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,750
unfortunately learned over the last few

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,700
years that the government's and big

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,340
companies are very happily you know

00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,310
looking into that data and sharing it

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,450
with each other and analyzing it and

00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:25,860
extracting all kinds of stuff from it

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,590
and you know I mean just a lot smallest

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,750
us internet provider sprint had a couple

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,990
of million data accesses done by the

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:37,350
government in the last year alone and

00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:42,890
it's not just us in Berlin the police

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:46,500
accessed 4.2 million mobile phone

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:48,479
connections in like two years time and

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,299
that's that's just crazy right i mean

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,009
they had to apparently check we're at

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,490
least half the people in the city were

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,630
in the last two years it's the i don't i

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,469
don't think that makes a lot of sense

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,780
and if you see the laws being written at

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:06,270
the moment of being supported octa sopa

00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,920
you know they're basically not exactly

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,050
planning to stop doing all day

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,090
right they want more and more they make

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:16,140
it legal after the fact as you see a lot

00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:19,950
of new us now with the NSA so they just

00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,450
want to extend the surging now we have

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,120
seen some of the results of what you can

00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,890
do with that data our researches show

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,590
that an analysis of your Facebook

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,150
connections can tell your sexual

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,860
preference now there are quite a few

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,380
countries in the world where your sexual

00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,030
preference can get you killed or put in

00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,420
jail for the rest of your life so that's

00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,220
a problem yeah you don't need to write

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,560
it down anywhere that can just get it

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,569
out of the data and now imagine how

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,620
often that goes wrong too because it's

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:52,620
all kind of you know wishy washy vague I

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,100
mean a lot of you might be married and

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,560
still see Facebook you know trying to

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,030
get you to date which is kind of odd

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,220
because it should know that you're

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,290
married and probably not that interested

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,150
in dating anymore do you know they get

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,940
it wrong a lot and that can get you in

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,280
jail 24 pretty ridiculous reasons so

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:15,690
there is a bit of an issue of this now

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,670
insurers would be pretty interested in

00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:19,890
your data because you know maybe you

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,720
know you want to get pregnant or your

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,310
wife wants to get pregnant you know

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,930
that's that's interesting to know for

00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,510
employers gives you know there are

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,670
companies who actually don't hire women

00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,620
between 25 and 30 kids you know they

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,440
might get pregnant and then well they

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,480
don't work anymore this is nasty stuff

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,720
company shouldn't know that right this

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,340
is not how it should be and none of this

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,220
has anything to do with terrorists

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,560
rights I mean the NSA spying on world

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,720
leaders like you know Angela Merkel and

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
you know the president of Brazil they

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,200
probably don't do it because they expect

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,480
them to blow up an airplane they do it

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,150
for economic reasons they do it because

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,100
the trade negotiations between you know

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,230
Boeing and Airbus there is money to be

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,660
made if you're bowing and you know what

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:06,510
the Airbus guys are gonna offer the

00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,150
customer yeah we are all losing a lot of

00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,190
money over there is nonsense to which is

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,530
of course why our countries are so upset

00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:15,060
about it i mean the European Union

00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,769
doesn't care much more about privacy

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,169
than the u.s. does but they care about

00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:19,980
the fact they're losing money here from

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,100
the

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:25,630
so you're losing money and freedom now

00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,090
you can solve the problem by ditching

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,770
your phone in your internet connection

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:32,010
but my company works another solution

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,660
call them clouds which is basically

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:38,200
control of your data run it on your home

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,850
own home the open source a GPL file

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:44,230
syncing a sharing desktop and mobile

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:46,390
apps web interface easy to install and

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:49,390
run at home I'll get into those details

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:52,510
in the next presentation and feel no

00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:54,280
more just come there or talk to me now

00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,200
today the main subject is something else

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,930
I'm going to talk for a little under an

00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:02,140
hour about where KD is and where it is

00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,730
going both the terms of people and the

00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,490
technology we develop I'm going to start

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,170
with the technology and then I'm going

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,850
to go to the people side and the

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,530
organizational side of things and the

00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,850
changes that are happening there because

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,370
there are a lot of changes in both areas

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,010
if you have a question at any point in

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,980
time just you know wave or talk to me

00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:25,390
how I have no problem being interrupted

00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:28,080
at all so I'm going to start with 20 bit

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:32,770
of history Katy was started in October

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,150
1996 by German Mattias a tree plan was

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:36,610
to build a desktop and the basic

00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,160
applications on top of the c++ killed

00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,650
toolkit which was by far back then and

00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,880
still today the best in terms of you

00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:47,680
know free tool kit technology so the

00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:53,080
same year they already released the katy

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,570
library 0.2 0.1 but katie 1.2 until

00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,160
nineteen ninety-eight that's also the

00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:59,770
year there was the first KD conference

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,310
de que te one conference which was 14

00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:05,680
people in a hotel somewhere in Germany

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,630
small beginnings KD 20 came out in two

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,610
thousand and as you can read here that's

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,300
where de cop started which is the base

00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,750
for the modern d best technology and

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:20,170
arts got replaced by well our staff k

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,150
HTML which is basically powering eighty

00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,910
percent of the browser's these days all

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:27,430
the iphones all the android phones they

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:30,180
all run a que HTML derived web browser

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:34,090
which we developed back then

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:38,710
and Katie treatment I came another two

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:42,880
years later now 2008 we Unleashed caddy

00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:44,020
for window apollon unsuspecting world we

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,140
did that actually at Google's

00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:49,090
headquarters in California and that was

00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,520
my first trip outside of Europe that was

00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:54,220
kind of cool some of you might remember

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,380
it was quite a rocky release presented a

00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,230
lot of major changes in all areas and

00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,350
because back then we shipped KD four

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,630
point oh so that was still one thing the

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,910
K desktop environment and so we tried to

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,890
ship everything at once and that was a

00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:12,340
big pain because some parts were already

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:16,660
ready a year before in 2007 but other

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,400
parts were not ready until 2009 so well

00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,010
we had to compromise because it was one

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,670
big blob so we all shipped it and as for

00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:26,910
point on that did not turn out very well

00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:31,710
we worked on changing things since then

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:35,200
which is why after four comes five well

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,990
no because shipping everything at once

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,600
didn't work for Katie 40 so we're not

00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:42,880
doing that anymore this time we have cut

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,520
it up in pieces that make sense we're

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:51,580
going to do it in pieces now I'm going

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,380
to talk about the first piece since for

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:56,169
Piniella has been a lot of work more

00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:58,000
than just you know making clocks we have

00:07:56,169 --> 00:08:00,940
about four or five hundred people active

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,310
in the KT community as in coding we

00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,860
don't only do a desktop plus my desktop

00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,990
but we also do a variation for tablets

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,040
plasma active we have had a netbook

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:15,669
edition since 2009 there's media center

00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:18,460
edition plasma media center and the KD

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,950
applications they're now doing so many

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,800
more things than they did in 1999 and

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:26,560
2000 that you know there's a full office

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,600
suite there's a pimp sweet a lot of more

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,680
stuff so and we're working on mobile

00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:35,110
applications to and G compris joined us

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,300
a while ago and basically because they

00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,789
wanted to build decent mobile

00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:42,099
applications and killed qml and the KD

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,180
libraries are very helpful for that so

00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:44,800
we're having

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:49,000
all kinds of projects joining us i'll

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,190
talk more about that later so KD these

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,210
days is the people doing all kinds of

00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:58,240
different things and what we do which

00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:01,600
includes plasma and offers the media

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,730
center the tablets the applications and

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,790
libraries will build on it they are all

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:08,500
separate products now and they go in

00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:10,000
different directions so I'm going to

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,820
talk about these different directions

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,290
now starting with libraries the

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:20,260
frameworks now the KD libraries started

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:23,140
out as the base for KD applications and

00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,360
the rule was basically if you have two

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,270
applications that share a piece of

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,880
functionality turn it into a library and

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,070
put it in the KD libraries so more and

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,959
more stuff got accumulated there and it

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:37,180
became one big blob with all kinds of

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,430
functionality some of it was basically

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:43,300
extra functionality but a lot of it was

00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:46,720
also working around and fixing things in

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:50,200
cute for example k URL gives better

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,920
parsing thank you URL that is so it adds

00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,630
up and builds on what was there in cute

00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,520
now we've actually stopped releasing

00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,550
this now for two years it has been

00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:03,910
frozen since 4.9 in preparation for

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:08,560
what's coming because what's coming is

00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:11,260
called frameworks 5 and the idea of it

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,480
is that we take this big blob of all

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,870
kinds of pieces complete separate

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,089
technologies like HTML or little pieces

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,760
that just extend a piece of cute and

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:23,800
we're cutting it up in pieces a big

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,480
chunk of that goes into cute cute is now

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,750
an open source projects with open

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,900
governance it's lgpl it's easy to

00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:34,089
contribute to so well we are one of the

00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:36,400
bigger compute contributors to cute now

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:41,470
by moving a lot of code from the KD

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:46,240
libraries into cute itself other parts

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:48,430
are basically being split up and made

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,470
available easily for application

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:53,410
developers to use cute application

00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:55,970
developers so the idea is that the KDE

00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:57,680
libraries disappear as they were

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,350
and they simply become a set of

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,279
independent components that you can use

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:09,230
as acute developer just small libraries

00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:11,480
for all kinds of functionality well

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:13,670
alpha one is out of the tool is already

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,649
out I think we're getting to better and

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:20,420
framework five hundo comes out in june

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:22,939
first it's all well tested documented

00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,129
cross-platform has easy build system etc

00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:27,319
etc obviously there's still quite a bit

00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:28,850
of work to be done but we have a lot of

00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,560
people working on it there's a bunch of

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:32,689
companies contributing and supporting

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,519
people to work on this it's of course

00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:36,800
very important for the killed ecosystem

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,379
and there's about a half a million cute

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,899
developers so there are a lot of people

00:11:39,379 --> 00:11:45,170
interested in this and getting this

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:47,720
moving this quickly forward so that's

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:50,959
our libraries and they're basically

00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:56,000
going places to put it mildly now let's

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,759
talk about plasma now plus my desktop

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,550
technology the idea behind plasma was

00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:05,569
that you know the developers that

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,300
develop the the desktop in kd3 point X

00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:11,300
they realized that a lot of changes were

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:13,879
coming ok back then high-resolution

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,120
displays weren't very obvious but you

00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:18,410
could probably imagine they were coming

00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,389
tablets were nowhere to be seen but

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,100
mobile phones were already you know

00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,100
smartphones were already on the market

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:28,129
and media centers of course were being

00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,829
used televisions and the developer said

00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:34,250
look you know we need to build something

00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:36,470
that allows you to do work on a

00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:40,399
television and on the phone and the

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:42,439
tablets in an easy way something that

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,389
that can work with all these devices but

00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:45,920
you can't build one user interface for

00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,319
all of those that doesn't work and if

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,240
you're trying it you're well not very

00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:52,850
smart there are a couple of projects

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,350
companies still doing it Microsoft sell

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,449
tribes but they're backpedaling because

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,579
it doesn't work Apple or smart from the

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:01,329
beginning they don't even try and they

00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,860
build separate operating systems and

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:06,819
canonical hasn't really made up their

00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,819
minds yet I believe

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,650
it as far as I can tell it doesn't work

00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:13,120
a single user interface and I mean it

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:14,680
makes sense right you can't have the

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,710
same user interface on a mobile phone

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,150
with a full HD resolution and on the

00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,880
television where you're sitting 10

00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:24,190
meters away from with maybe also full HD

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,290
and on a computer screen perhaps also

00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,780
full HD but again totally different one

00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,690
use with mouse not reuse with remote

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,330
control another one you use with touch

00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:37,810
and there are tablets and everything in

00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:39,640
between and well there will be wrist

00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,480
watches that you have to control my

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,250
voice but how can you share technology

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,260
and that's the idea behind plasma share

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,610
as much of the underlying technology all

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:54,070
the logic is in the underlying plasma

00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:56,230
technology and the user interface is

00:13:54,070 --> 00:14:01,000
basically unique for application it's

00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:04,420
basically right now qml far but back

00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,980
then in 2008 the technologies that we

00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:09,520
were building on were not really ready

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,500
for this and we had to hack around a lot

00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,410
of issues and cue graphic few and other

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:16,000
parts of cute that we were building on I

00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,080
mean graphics drivers weren't ready I

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,930
mean if you used back then if you used a

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:25,210
plasma desktop with nvidia or ati or

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,190
Intel or any other graphical drivers you

00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:29,050
know it sucked right the graphics

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:30,610
drivers were totally not ready back then

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:32,740
and that goes for pretty much every part

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:36,520
of the stack it wasn't ready for what we

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:40,210
were doing luckily we are now right

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:41,800
technology has moved on and plasma next

00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:43,840
which is basically the code name for the

00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,940
next plus mod release and obvious i

00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:51,640
think is building on cute 5 + qm l two

00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,400
and these two technologies are perfectly

00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:56,350
made for what we want to do pixel

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,540
perfect design is finally possible you

00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,580
don't have all these weird you know off

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,840
x 1 pixel things that you have in the

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,510
current plasma desktop that are

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,730
impossible to fix you have full 3d

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:10,750
acceleration it totally runs on the GPU

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:14,350
it's fully separate threads it's really

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:18,070
butter smooth and fast and of course

00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,720
high DPI support is coming we're going

00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:24,060
to be able to switch transparent

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,939
if you have a tablet you plug it into a

00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,649
screen and a mouse in a dog station for

00:15:27,939 --> 00:15:32,860
example the desktop and your

00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:34,810
applications can morph over to a desktop

00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:37,209
interface you know your document is

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,819
still open your web browser still shows

00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:42,160
the same webpage just on a different

00:15:38,819 --> 00:15:44,800
user interface and there's the

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,860
competition is not even trying this kind

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,370
of stuff back to switch between these

00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,779
interfaces and well we basically have

00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,990
the underlying technology we had it

00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,850
already and in katy for but now we're

00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,990
finally able to really implement it the

00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:04,120
way it's supposed to work so this is

00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:07,209
really cool stuff basically that's

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,649
coming now the release is gonna call

00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:13,149
going to be called plasma 2014 point 6 I

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,149
guess you can guess then when it's going

00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:19,839
to be released at will indeed be in June

00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:22,509
17 to score Utley targeted now as I said

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:25,480
it's going to be pixel perfect there's a

00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:27,309
lot of work on new design but this is

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,100
still a couple of screenshots of the

00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:31,990
current theme d the old theme but as you

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,910
see you can now put things exactly in

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,529
the right place and that alone makes

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:41,379
things look a lot better already there's

00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:43,389
work being done on high DPI support the

00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,639
top shows like a testing widget for

00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:47,970
different you know screen sizes there's

00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:50,350
work being done on Wayland support

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,449
neither of these things will be perfect

00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:57,459
in the first release which is as I said

00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:59,639
in June but well they'll be in decent

00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:02,019
shape to play around to it and test and

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:03,519
the next the second release will

00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:05,860
probably have all these things you know

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,900
fully supported there's not just

00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:11,110
technical work that's going on under the

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,939
hood we have the KD design team they're

00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,780
working on a new theme they're working

00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:18,220
on new icons cleaner flatter and if you

00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,270
like that stuff pretty much everyone

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:24,640
seems to these days there's also the KD

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,589
usability team they have been working on

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,089
a new human interface guidelines which

00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,370
are basically coming together now

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:30,940
they've been giving usability trainings

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,580
at the cat

00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,680
me to the developers and they've been

00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,660
redesigning a lot of applications to be

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,150
more efficient more fit for the workflow

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,120
a lot of people have the network

00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,640
management a telepathy it's really all

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,230
over that changes in this regard and I

00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,630
think this will have a pretty big effect

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:51,550
as well for the end-users obviously so

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,000
it won't just be smooth but it'll also

00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:57,220
actually fits in normal workflows at the

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,470
same time you know the developers

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:02,890
realize that the workflows that you used

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,870
to are very valuable and it's just dumb

00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,190
to throw these things away all the

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:08,830
experience you have if the user

00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:11,440
interface shouldn't be thrown away out

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,570
of the window it you should be able to

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:18,010
build on what is there so the idea is to

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:20,470
keep things as much the same as possible

00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,240
and just allow more flexibility and

00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,600
allow you to optimize the interface for

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,920
your own use case and make it more

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,570
smooth make it better designed but the

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,250
parody games will stay the same what

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,260
you're used to will work the way you're

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,240
used to it working you don't have to

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,040
adapt the way you work your computer

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,590
should adapt to you after all it has all

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,270
these you know CPU cycles it can use for

00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:47,770
fancy things that you'd be able to do

00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:50,830
what you want right so the applications

00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:52,690
are currently at 4 13 and the libraries

00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,820
and plus my above frozen have been for a

00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:57,550
few releases to set the library since

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,530
4.9 it's a little over two years plasma

00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:02,710
has been frozen since four point 11 so

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,300
no more releases since a year now but

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,940
the applications are still releasing and

00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,380
they will probably continue to do so

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,910
we're now on a four-month release cycle

00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:13,900
of then the next release is coming out

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:15,520
in august for point 14 we're not

00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,500
entirely sure what we're going to do

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,840
with 415 we're currently discussing if

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,580
that should be long term release so that

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,350
the developers can then start moving

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,700
over to the frameworks because what

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,580
frameworks are going to be released in

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,020
June as I said so well in theory we

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,780
should be able to start porting the

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:37,380
applications some of them are already

00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:41,440
working on porting yes

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,970
so yeah we might do 415 as a long term

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,250
relation and start releasing the

00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,780
applications based on framework five but

00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,960
it's also possible that we want that

00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,360
will keep releasing a 4 16 and a 4 17

00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,650
while we do a framework 5 based

00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:58,060
applications release we're currently

00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:00,160
discussing how to do that in the best

00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,530
way possible I mean we want to disrupt

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,240
as little as possible what the

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,580
distributions are doing and not you know

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,330
get in the way there but we also have

00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:13,570
discussions about cleaning up things the

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:15,340
core KD set of applications I mean again

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,170
we still have a lot of legacy dare of

00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,250
the old you know desktop environment

00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:22,420
which should come with these

00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,940
applications but not of those KD pin is

00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,060
part of the KD application release but

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,230
caligra is not I mean why is the person

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,940
information management set of

00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:33,790
applications part of it but not the

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,500
opposite I mean these things make little

00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:39,760
sense we're trying to clean this up in a

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:42,130
way that what makes more sense and we

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,840
might be releasing more flexibly I mean

00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:46,510
amarok releases in a different schedule

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,520
than the applications so we want to

00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:50,440
accommodate that but having it may be

00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,480
part of it I mean what's happening I

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:55,210
mean it's literally being discussed like

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,210
this week and last week so I really

00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:02,260
can't predict where it's going but some

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:03,520
ideas are there already so that's all

00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:05,380
the technical side of things are there

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,730
any questions about this because I'm

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,190
going to change the Rex is now a little

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:18,590
bit yes

00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:20,809
I repeat the question okay so you asked

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:24,259
if it's possible to have both KD 4 and

00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:26,600
KD 5 or the framework five based apps on

00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:28,840
how you call them at the same system yes

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,399
that that should certainly be possible

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,889
especially with the applications because

00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:35,539
we might even do parallel releases some

00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:37,669
of the applications are still part of

00:21:35,539 --> 00:21:40,220
the 4 series some of the applications

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:41,899
are part of the 5 Series if they're

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,460
going to be called that I'm not sure

00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:48,230
exactly how we're going to do that but

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,789
yeah it should be possible to run them

00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:52,669
all I mean again this little disruption

00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:55,159
as possible I on a technical level this

00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:59,059
change compared to the KT 40 release is

00:21:55,159 --> 00:22:01,009
far smaller and we're moving in we're

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:03,620
basically refining the technology but

00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:06,049
it's not a huge change and a big

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,659
important part here is again to to just

00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:11,480
catch up with well now is technically

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:16,100
possible on the desktop and leap ahead

00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:19,370
again of everyone else as usual so let's

00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:22,639
talk then about the anymore crises by

00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:25,460
the way then I'm going to move on to the

00:22:22,639 --> 00:22:27,830
well social side so so to say the

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:31,309
organizational side so katie has been

00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:33,049
around since 1996 started as a bunch of

00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,720
people trying to build a desktop

00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:39,049
environment and has grown into a very

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:44,659
very large bunch of developers doing a

00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:47,210
lot of things now this is all being

00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:49,309
supported by the KETV this is our legal

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:53,570
organization and acadia EV they take

00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:57,830
care of organizing events Sprint's

00:22:53,570 --> 00:23:00,590
academy they protect us legally take

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:04,370
care of a lot of administrative work but

00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:08,509
the kdv also is an organization that can

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:11,179
help us change organizational change it

00:23:08,509 --> 00:23:12,860
provides a place where the core KD

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:17,029
contributors can come together and

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:19,460
discuss while all kinds of subjects I

00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:22,129
mean we decided four or five years ago

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,810
to do more sprints and put as much of

00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:25,550
our money into sprint so too

00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:29,270
so the budget pretty much goes to

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:31,370
basically developer meetings we

00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:33,350
introduce the code of conduct we started

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:38,210
a join the game program to get more

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:40,520
people to support us set up a copyright

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,250
assignment option for people for to the

00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,760
EV organize the desktop summits we've

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,520
known lots of other things now I'm going

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,980
to highlight a few of these because they

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,570
are particularly important I think one

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,370
of the biggest example of the things

00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,400
that we did they over the last year's is

00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:00,830
the cadet KD manifesto it's all

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,960
manifested at KD dorky was made possible

00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:05,660
by the mall among others the work of

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,500
Kevin Owens and it's basically a

00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:11,960
definition of KDE as our values and our

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:14,390
commitments so it's not about anything

00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,150
technical it's really about what do we

00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:20,120
as a community once and how do we want

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:21,950
to reach it and if you're part of katy

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,250
what does it mean what what is it to be

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:28,040
KDE project because a KDE projects can

00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:31,340
be but it's pretty fair right things

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,410
owncloud used to be Katie project which

00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:35,120
obviously doesn't use anything related

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,670
to kill it shares pretty much nothing

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,130
technically with KDE but what it shared

00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:44,450
were the people and the ideas behind it

00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,070
and there are lots of other projects I

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,930
mean fell grind I believe has been a

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,340
part of katy for a very long time and

00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,320
again that that has nothing to do with

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,780
killed or or anything of the KDE

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,810
libraries it's not Katie related at all

00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:59,810
on a technical level but the people were

00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:02,990
of a similar in our philosophy and had

00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,910
the same ideas so writing this down is

00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:07,940
really important but because it makes

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:10,520
clear to outsiders what you are about as

00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:12,170
a community and this is also what we did

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,510
in opensuse decayed the opensuse

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:16,250
strategy efforts we didn't change

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:18,260
anything with what we did was write down

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,940
what we were about and this is really

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,150
important for a community to have a

00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:25,130
clear idea of what you are about and the

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,750
manifesto is that and the results of

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:29,120
that speak for themselves since the

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:34,040
manifesto we had a youth variety of

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:36,240
projects join us you probably know about

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,950
some of these and

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,770
father she once let me quickly go over

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:45,150
some of them bib text I don't even know

00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:47,880
a bit text is but it's think a markup

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:50,580
language but we had a bit text editor

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,920
join us the wiki event project that's a

00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,290
universe italian university based

00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:58,679
knowledge database project that joined

00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,570
us we had educational application g comp

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,200
rejoin us that's actually former gnome

00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,990
application we had cute curve team join

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:11,250
us they were developing a cross toolkit

00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:14,309
style the kdenlive video editor to be 2d

00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:16,590
animation editor we had projects

00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:20,460
necesitas a minister join us they were

00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:23,340
projects that ported cute to android and

00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,470
were building build tools for androids

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:29,910
and they became part of the kt community

00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:32,340
and but we actually started a project

00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,440
called the KD incubator to help all

00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,720
these new projects join us because it

00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,600
was actually a lot of work to help them

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,910
all get ok the infrastructure and you

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,429
know getting embedded in our well in our

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,880
culture in the way we work actually

00:26:44,429 --> 00:26:50,550
Kevin Alton started that KD incubator to

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,470
I guess he felt bad for all the work

00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:58,170
that his manifesto had created for

00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:59,640
everybody so and that that's that's what

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,260
the manifesto will learned it but that's

00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,760
all all the changes we've been going to

00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:08,550
now the cute projects has not has been

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,620
very close always to KD obviously now

00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:13,679
the cute ecosystem I already mention it

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,600
it is huge I mean it's it's 500,000 cute

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,360
developers I mean that's more than

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,420
opensuse has users and developers using

00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:24,780
kills so this is well huge toolkit

00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:28,080
project and it's growing very fast and

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,120
has grown very closely with us now the

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,830
ecosystem around killed has grown I mean

00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,340
there's a huge number of companies that

00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:40,470
is contributing to cute and it's growing

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:42,330
and we um and as I said with the

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:46,679
framework five we're getting cold from

00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:48,660
KD into kills so getting closer that way

00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,710
but we're also building the KD

00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:54,149
frameworks

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,679
to be essentially a part of well the

00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,450
library sets available for cute

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,190
developers to use giving extra

00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,710
functionality to the cute developments

00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:03,419
around the world so on a technical level

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,179
we're getting close we're also doing

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:07,980
that on it you know social level we

00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:10,520
organized the cute contributor summit

00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:12,779
together with Academy last year and

00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:17,070
we'll probably do that again in the

00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:18,960
future so with Katie become more

00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:22,909
relevant to Q than cute more relevant to

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,770
KDE there's growing relation ship there

00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:27,720
so you've seen all the technical

00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:29,220
directors we're going you see now a

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,190
couple of the social changes that are

00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,840
happening for example of the manifesto

00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:39,059
so you might wonder where it's all going

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,640
right so a recent proposal from the KT

00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,799
if he bought gave a bit of a hint and

00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,590
the proposals called the Community

00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:50,010
Partnership Program and the idea behind

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,140
the proposal is to allow the EV to deal

00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:54,899
closed with other communities on legal

00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,580
and financial matters so for example if

00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:58,350
you have a small community that is

00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,659
developing an application they want to

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:02,669
organize a conference but they don't

00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,140
really have anything set up to handle

00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:06,720
the funds and take care of the legal

00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,980
side of things the ktv can help them

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,870
actually make this happen now there's

00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,590
that whole bunch of other similar things

00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,630
it's basically showing that we're trying

00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,860
to expand the scope we want to move

00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:25,679
wider and further in this and another

00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:28,980
thing is ktv has always historically

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,360
been not involved in development and for

00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,830
example if you wanted to sponsor a

00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,990
developer you had to find another way

00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:36,600
than KETV you couldn't ask for the

00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,760
nation's given to ktv and let that let

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,710
Eevee pay a developer we didn't do that

00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,409
in the past actually the critter

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:46,230
foundation had to set up or create a

00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:47,610
team set up that critter foundation to

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:49,289
be able to sponsor two or three

00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:53,070
developers working on critter and Emma

00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:54,990
Rock has done the same in the past set

00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:58,740
up their own foundation to handle funds

00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:01,409
for development of em rock now pay

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,940
development is a complicated topic as

00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:06,000
must well first

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:08,070
fkd contributors volunteered which make

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,540
us you know one of the largest free

00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:15,210
software projects that actually still

00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:17,700
really volunteer-based but at the same

00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:19,590
time you know there are is work that

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,740
needs to be done that it's hard to do

00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:24,930
with volunteers and that can be paid for

00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,180
and we have sponsors and people willing

00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,040
to support these things as a creative

00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,930
foundation have shown so one of the

00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,430
things that some of the people in the

00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:37,410
community are now looking into is how

00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:39,630
can we do more in this area as well it's

00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:41,610
not all change that we're doing right we

00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:43,230
want to stay true to ourselves it's

00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,660
important that we preserve what we have

00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:49,080
as a community I mean katie has gotten

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,850
to wear this today by the culture and

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,130
the practices that it had over the last

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:56,850
15 16 years so we don't want to lose

00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,650
that and I mean this this culture are

00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,430
things like you know a lot of these you

00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:03,870
know right these are similar in opensuse

00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:06,630
there's there's you know just do wear

00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:08,370
togas t credit where it is due assume

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:10,050
good intentions which is something i

00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:12,090
really like in the KD community if

00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,950
you're having a debate with other people

00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,930
you should assume that they want the

00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:18,810
same things as you want after all we all

00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:23,400
want free sorta to succeed at this this

00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:24,600
helps keep discussions healthy honestly

00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,250
this is one of the things are sometimes

00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,920
miss a little bit in opensuse as a

00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,450
community you know this is assuming of

00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:32,430
the right intentions of other people

00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,220
some people seem to assume others just

00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:37,650
want to kill the geek oh that's insane

00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,660
you know people don't want that let's

00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:42,750
say macavee it's a place with a lot of

00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,570
creativity innovation open you know

00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:48,420
people can have fun and do all kinds of

00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,190
different things little politics I mean

00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:53,010
katie is known for being a very a

00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:55,920
political organization really a

00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,990
meritocracy I discusses with people who

00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,700
really claim it's not possible to make

00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,980
meritocratic decisions with a large

00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,750
group of people or katie i think is by

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,060
far the biggest examples showing that

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,830
it's possible that companies don't have

00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,840
to direct the technologies that you use

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,860
but the other way around and there are

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,030
consulting companies active in KDE and

00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,559
that's when you talk to them explain

00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,970
that one of the reasons they're at

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,399
different katie is because it helps

00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,639
their consulting work if their customers

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,870
come to them and say look you know what

00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,149
source code management system should we

00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:29,190
use what tools should be used to build

00:32:27,149 --> 00:32:31,649
our software then they just look at what

00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,529
KD does and recommend that to their

00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:36,539
customer this KD is such a purely

00:32:34,529 --> 00:32:38,669
technical community they usually pick

00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:41,490
technologies because they're good not

00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:43,470
because they're sold very well and you

00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:45,090
know this is a piece of culture you want

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,419
to keep because it's very important to

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:50,610
keep things you know technical and well

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:55,080
smart basically we value these things

00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:58,350
you want to keep them so we set up the

00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,659
community working group about six years

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:03,749
ago which is there to basically preserve

00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:05,639
our culture too but it's a group of

00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:08,340
trusted community members that deal with

00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:10,799
conflicts in a you know social issues

00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,509
and they have been around for many years

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,129
and they never had any teeth they were

00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:16,740
not allowed to kick they had no

00:33:14,129 --> 00:33:18,779
authority they could just talk to people

00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,119
nothing else I mean they didn't really

00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:23,850
have any power couldn't kick out people

00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,740
nothing yeah and they've done a really

00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,289
good job and I think they've built up a

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,259
lot of trust so at the last academy i

00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:33,470
proposed to give them the ability to

00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,840
deal with the situations where people

00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:38,909
just aren't reasonable and don't wanna

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,409
listen sometimes this happens in

00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:43,440
opensuse this is something the board

00:33:40,409 --> 00:33:44,909
deals with and in KDE days is now

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,440
something the community working group

00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:48,659
deals with you need to have a process

00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,360
for this with is something you know I

00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:53,759
also noticed and my job here at Sousa

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,320
you need to have a way of dealing with I

00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,899
mean some people just aren't going to

00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,440
change it luckily only happens once

00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:03,139
every few years but it does happen

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,759
another change and that I actually

00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:09,419
kicked through myself as well is the KD

00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:11,879
community mailing list so governance

00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:14,460
related discussions like the manifesto

00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:16,950
used to be discussed on the KETV mailing

00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:19,740
list but KETV Melling this is a closed

00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:22,349
list it's a members-only nest private

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,210
list and well if you want to grow your

00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:26,700
community and be more inclusive you

00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,000
shouldn't discuss crucial things like a

00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:32,139
manifesto on a closely

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,389
right so we've set up the KD community

00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,250
mailing list and that's now the venue or

00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:39,070
we discuss things like the manifesto on

00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,419
and changes to it so we've opened up a

00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:41,980
little bit more of our governor's I

00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:44,940
think that's a good way of you know

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:48,010
keeping the open nature of our project

00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:50,110
so again there's change there are things

00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,210
that stay the same add the manifesto

00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:55,330
defines what we want it's broader than

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:57,640
others and then basically put kind of on

00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:00,940
paper what we want and how we wanted as

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:02,620
a community and we've opened up you know

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,870
we formalize community management a

00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,790
little more and the board wants to work

00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,820
with other organizations the frameworks

00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:11,620
bring us closer to killed our

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,620
applications and plasma are moving

00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,630
forward to new technology if you are all

00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,260
these things up I mean this is a

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:23,770
complicated world and KD it first moved

00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:27,190
to being a desktop to being people and

00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:29,560
now it's kind of going matter katie is

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,870
becoming a a community for communities a

00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,420
place where a lot of smaller communities

00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:37,060
like the M rock and the Kalinga but now

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:39,160
also gcom priests and the wiki of em and

00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,930
you know all these different projects

00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,330
come together and the one umbrella and

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:46,270
work together and what brings them

00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:48,100
together is not the technology but it's

00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,990
the people and the way they look at the

00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,480
world how they want to do things that's

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:56,710
what brings people together and that's

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,150
what matters so you know we have more

00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,280
and more people going in more and more

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,680
directions but that's a good thing right

00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,960
our technology adapt but it's also

00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,850
expanding and our organizational

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,010
structure becomes basically you know

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,710
this there's matter thing a community of

00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:13,720
communities so it's not a technical

00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:18,400
thing again it's really about how to do

00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:20,260
things and I think well this this had a

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,640
lot of this gives more room for everyone

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:26,530
basically all people have more you know

00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,360
there's more you can do with more people

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,840
together right we're all trying to move

00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:35,820
free software forward so if you have any

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,820
questions this is the time to shoot them

00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:47,229
does it make any kind of sense I know

00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:50,919
I'm I went a little quick I was supposed

00:36:47,229 --> 00:36:53,229
to talk for 50 minutes need for 37 so I

00:36:50,919 --> 00:37:00,609
might have skipped a details here and

00:36:53,229 --> 00:37:04,150
there I mean was it here apparently it

00:37:00,609 --> 00:37:07,169
is no questions well then you're out

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,169
