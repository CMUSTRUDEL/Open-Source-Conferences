Title: osc14: Richard Brown, High Availability Clustering on openSUSE
Publication date: 2014-04-28
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Everyone likes to talk about how Linux is a robust, stable choice for a server operating system, but reality is a little different - Even the best systems fail, but that doesn't mean your users have to notice. High Availability Clustering (HA) gives you a way of building systems that can monitor themselves, and react to failures, keeping your services (eg. Web server, Database server, etc) running even when the server they're running on has failed, or is in need of maintenance. This workshop will show you how to build a basic cluster using the HA software available in openSUSE. You will need to bring a Laptop capable of running two openSUSE 13.1 virtual machines (preferably using VirtualBox) in order to participate.
