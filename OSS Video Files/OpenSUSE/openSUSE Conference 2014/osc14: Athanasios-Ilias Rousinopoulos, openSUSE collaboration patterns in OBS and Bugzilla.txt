Description: 
	Software repository mining and collaborative software engineering are part of my ongoing research in Software Engineering Research Group. During 2013 my paper with title "An early empirical sentiment analysis of openSUSE Factory Developers and Users" [1] was accepted and then presented to WSL 2013 [Porto Alegre,Brasil,July 4th - 5th, 2013].
This presentation is about studying openSUSE Factory data in relation to the Bugzilla and OBS. A concrete quantitative analysis of the openSUSE Factory data over the last 3 years is presented, with focus on the possible correlation between the number of accepted requests in OBS and the openSUSE Factory bugs in the Bugzilla.
