Title: osc14: Tobias Mueller,  What's cooking in GNOME
Publication date: 2014-04-27
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	The talk will introduce to some of the design philosophies inherent in GNOME 3 as well as the main changes brought to users and developers. Also, since GNOME 3.12 is yet another step of a long lasting incrementally improved user experience, the future of GNOME's development will be speculated on.

foundation and I want to well talk with

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:24,090
you about gnome 3 you know three point

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,820
oh and well in particular note 3 point

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,670
12 and while I like talking I like to

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,170
hear myself i also want to engage with

00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:33,420
you so if you have any comment or any

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,790
question or just well want to make a

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,310
remark make yourself hard and I'll try

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:41,159
to well see you and I'll try to engage

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,930
with you if I don't well see you or if I

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,640
don't engage with you it's most likely

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,490
not the case that i don't like you it's

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,540
just that i don't see you so just shout

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:54,930
in case you have anything to say so um

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,450
know myself oh oh let me let me start by

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,850
by talking about your gnome oh now that

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,759
i see that i brought thing right I

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,469
brought swag so if you happen to have a

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:07,950
smart question a question that I like

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:11,430
then you may be able to receive some

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:14,300
swag that I brought so that again any

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,300
products managed to engage

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,030
so know what is known you can ask well

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,220
first and foremost you probably do know

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:25,100
that it's a desktop environment whatever

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,860
that means right so when when you start

00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,740
your computer the things you see that

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,630
that certainly is known but Graham is

00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,270
much more right we have the foundation

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,980
with a genome which takes care of well

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:41,360
fostering free software and Vilma

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,220
particular now itself is a community so

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,390
if you want to make something happen if

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,120
you want to spread the word about free

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,160
software if you want to only enable your

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,200
local community to become you to do

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,410
computing then you know me as a

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,180
community for you know is a bigger

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,990
project than the desktop environment

00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,030
itself we have things like OS tree or I

00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,730
don't know our translation

00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,880
infrastructures not only use not only

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,600
been used for genome projects all right

00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,060
I just hadn't been interrupted my on my

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:22,070
desktop I was surprised to see that

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:24,110
sorry so um hello well is there many

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:26,360
things but we are here to talk mainly

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:30,200
about the desk of environment we can

00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,680
talk about well other things yes I am

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,120
more on the government side of known so

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,590
I'm not that much of a technical person

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,570
so we can also talk about these things

00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:41,440
especially recently we've hit the news

00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,760
without having a tiny financial problem

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,970
but let's talk about John the desolate

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,730
balance first down three is our newest

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:53,810
effort in bringing more free software to

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,640
more people it's been launched or the

00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:59,420
efforts have been launched in 2008 and

00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:03,890
we've made a release in 2011 and that's

00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:08,720
that stirred up some well comments say

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:14,030
as well with 93 paradigms have been

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,470
refreshed say and new ways and methods

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,070
of interacting with your computer have

00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:22,729
been used so ever sir I came up with 93

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:25,700
point 0 in 2011 and by now we are at the

00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:26,560
three-point 12 which is the latest and

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,389
greatest

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,930
release that made so far I think in well

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,760
if you start going three the first thing

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,790
that you might notice is its elegant

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,090
design we try to be unobtrusive we try

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:46,210
to not get in your way we try to enable

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,430
you to be as efficient as possible when

00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,650
you use your computer thinking that when

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,450
you do use your computer you do not use

00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,669
that well for the sake of using the

00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:56,980
computer but to actually do anything

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,560
with it or to do something with it like

00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:01,389
you're doing well at least people i know

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,160
they don't sit in front of the computer

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:04,870
because they like sitting they like to

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,669
sit in front of the computer but they

00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:09,070
need to do out in a facebook or

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,389
accounting or things like that and we

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,160
try to enable you to do that as

00:05:10,389 --> 00:05:16,750
efficiently as possible so this is a

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,280
probably what most people see when they

00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,570
start known right they start the browser

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,610
in acutely because that's what you do

00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:27,130
nowadays and this is what it would look

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:29,290
like if you then want to start say more

00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:31,990
or different applications he would get

00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:35,890
into the activities overview which looks

00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:38,979
something like that and you try to make

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:41,710
you what we enable you to access the

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:45,460
most important things well the easiest

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:47,740
way possible the way we think is is that

00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,660
way so this is the activities overview

00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,030
you see your open applications or rather

00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:53,740
windows they're off and you have your

00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,419
favorite applications on the left hand

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,860
side and on the right hand side you have

00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:02,440
like different virtual desktops if you

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:04,690
use dig known this for a while you will

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,479
see a notification we have a we

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:09,389
introduced a new notification system

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:14,110
that tries to not get in your way but

00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:16,660
you can configure well based on your

00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,280
needs you can say well i don't i don't

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:19,539
want to want notifications right now

00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,210
because i'm really busy and I don't want

00:06:19,539 --> 00:06:26,700
to be interrupted by a chat message or

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:29,200
buy buy a new installation of a program

00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,810
so again we try to you to get out of the

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,479
way we try to enable you to be efficient

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:38,120
as efficient as possible with your task

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,360
at hand these notifications

00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,070
can also be interacted with which is

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,070
something i really like it boosts my

00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:48,620
production at least a productivity sorry

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:50,990
so when you have those those

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,120
certifications some of them can be

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:55,280
interacted with mine and well in this

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,470
example you can just type your your

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,360
message as reply from an incoming

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:04,040
message but you would also control your

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,080
A through music for example what you

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,070
will also notice is that we have a

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,300
desktop search which well first of all

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:12,680
searches the applications you have

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,660
installed right so you want to install

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,370
an application you hit the ebay sorry

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,750
you want to launch an application you

00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:21,320
get these super key or the Windows key

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:23,060
whatever and then you type well the

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,139
application you want to start if you do

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,080
not select it from the left hand side

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:28,370
and another one researches the name of

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,900
the application but also the description

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,870
which i think is really really cool

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:36,560
because I for one when I have a new

00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,199
installation I always start by setting a

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,490
keyboard shortcut like ctrl alt T cheese

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:47,150
fire up a terminal and I can never can

00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:49,880
remember what program and actually is

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:52,310
that sets the the shortcuts so I just

00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,039
fire up the activities of you type

00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,960
shortcut and it brings me the correct

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,729
thing to open because it also searches

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,010
the description of the programs at hand

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:02,510
so that's very handy and it's not only

00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,930
applications in the description it's

00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:08,539
also um well other things that you can

00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:12,289
go install and configure like in this

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:15,979
example we have filed or software in

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:18,910
here so these search providers allow you

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,590
to you will also search your contacts a

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,599
or a calendar entries and things like

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:26,349
that so this is really for me at least

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,699
there's really handy because I just I

00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:31,039
can just type whatever I want and then

00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:34,880
it'll probably come up with the correct

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,740
thing that I want to up to access but

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,659
there's much more to none three so when

00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,070
we launch now three we had a revamped

00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:48,740
help system again hoping to well to

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:51,829
reach the greatest number of people to

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,100
do their for heating so when you try

00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:56,280
this

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,320
the help was a flat linear file write a

00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:02,070
document that you would read from from

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,310
top to bottom yeah we'll be with the new

00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,330
health system its topic base so you when

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,580
you launch the help for your chat

00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,740
application for example it will it could

00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:13,170
present you with a question like do you

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,180
want to send a file and then you can

00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:17,250
click that and you can help you can get

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,090
help on that topic so you can browse

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:24,720
your way through the help well based on

00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:26,490
a topic by topic a base well yeah topic

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,360
by topic rather than from from top to

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:32,670
bottom and there's many small things

00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,810
that we think improve your day-to-day

00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:38,550
usage of your computer in fact some well

00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:43,890
we have brought new technologies we

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:48,650
built on our old library still write so

00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:51,510
well having a new face the code itself

00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:54,450
has not changed under percent so we have

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,030
made many improvements that we think of

00:09:54,450 --> 00:10:02,810
better or enable people to use their

00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:06,000
computer better as we are not our code

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,440
can be likely libraries we have can be

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,670
used from pretty much any language which

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,210
is actually exciting if you think about

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:14,790
it so we have a G object introspection

00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:18,150
which enables you to use the libraries

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,560
from say Python or Java Script or any

00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,350
other language if you Pro if you can

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,720
provide the transition for the for the

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,970
object introspection that's actually

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,890
cool so that allows you to write you

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,890
another application or to use the non

00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:35,670
libraries from well the language you use

00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:37,830
right from the languaging knob and we've

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,770
actually made javascript the default

00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:43,830
language now for new applications and

00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:47,430
combined with the CSS steaming we hope

00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:50,310
to be able to attract well more people

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:54,330
who already know these languages and it

00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:57,960
turned out as we will we will dive into

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:59,960
later that this actually helped well to

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,120
bring more people to the grammar school

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,440
so if you happen to know JavaScript and

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,890
CSS already

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,360
then give it a try that's actually well

00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,180
it's an interesting choice and it should

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,130
make it easy to start to hack on the on

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:18,540
the grinnell platform what you actually

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:23,070
right now software so we achieve all

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:28,430
that like the usability improvements and

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:31,430
all with all we do use 3d acceleration

00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,940
now as we're on the free software world

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:39,560
unfortunately not every whelps a device

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:42,960
does have accelerated 3d graphics right

00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,840
or they don't use to have at least we

00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:50,520
used to have a so called fallback mode

00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,170
but now we drop that in 3.8 and if you

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,380
do run again three-point 12 now on

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:58,680
hardware that is known to not provide

00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:00,630
proper or is not capable of running 3d

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,450
on your graphics card it will use

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:05,640
software software rendering so you can

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,620
use the same genome 3 experience on

00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,800
pretty much any device well that's

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:15,810
actually cool it uses llvm pipe to

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:18,090
render the 3d operations and software if

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,270
you want to have the more traditional

00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:25,860
experience like the old hole in the old

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:27,690
num days then we have a known flashback

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,830
I think it's all ours I was thinking

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:30,210
whether it's called them classic or

00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,840
mental aspect but I think they're

00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:35,910
classic is what a bunch of holes it and

00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:37,980
that's essentially Dignam flashback is

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:41,220
essentially we'll go through each and

00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:44,250
shell but with a bunch of extensions to

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,160
make it appear well as if it was an

00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,320
older you know or it has the old of Nome

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,860
user experience and that actually shows

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,020
the capability of the platform right so

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:58,110
you can stop in a bunch of extensions

00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:02,760
and you can adapt and change it to you

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:04,680
like which is quite cool if you want to

00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:07,980
give it a try there's several ways to

00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,380
actually do it one of well maybe the

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,470
easiest is to get a an image from our

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,570
servers I think we we also have virtual

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,030
machine images in case you want to to

00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,570
run it

00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:21,430
virtual machines the blow directly and

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,280
if you do try it and you find something

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,050
that you do not like them as I've as i

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,840
mentioned try one of the extensions we

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,910
have we have this amazing website

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,590
extensions are mounted up and it lists I

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,870
actually don't know how many thousand

00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:39,520
extensions but there's many many

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:44,020
extensions that change your desktop well

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:48,370
and hopefully make it enable you to use

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:50,410
know much more efficiently um as I've

00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:53,110
said already extensions are basically

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,430
JavaScript files so that that allowed

00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,920
many people to write these extensions

00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:59,620
and if you find anything that you think

00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,230
should be different with indignation

00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,940
shell of no user experience you can go

00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:05,350
to the extensions website and check

00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,330
whether there is an extension that does

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,330
that already the likelihood is actually

00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:13,270
quite high and in fact installation is

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:15,640
very easy so this website has on/off

00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:17,770
buttons for these extensions and if you

00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,710
click the on/off button and we'll just

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:24,510
install the implicit install and run the

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:27,100
deep plugin that's actually quite good i

00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:29,980
well it works with it with Firefox and

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:33,430
the gnome web browser I don't know what

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,470
that works with chrome and if that

00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,720
doesn't float your boat you might want

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:41,620
to have a look at the keynote tweak tool

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:44,590
which well incorporates easy access to

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:48,040
many changes that people are likely to

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:53,680
make or wanting to make one of them is

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:57,010
for being placing folders or links on

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,280
your desktop if that's what's what was

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:02,410
got rid of with the gnome gnome 3 but

00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:05,260
people said well I still want to you

00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:07,060
know have I don't know a file on my

00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,860
desktop that I want to click if you want

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:12,040
that that sorry creature will enable

00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,270
that that switch and off you go and

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,090
there's many things it's actually very

00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:21,340
rich the treat so where do we come from

00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:24,670
dignan sui afford was firstly of the

00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,170
gram 3 idea was first we presented in

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:29,019
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:31,690
at our annual conference go Eric dignam

00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:34,329
users and developers conference back in

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:36,339
today in Turkey so you see we go to

00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:38,290
interesting places we've been to the

00:15:36,339 --> 00:15:41,560
Hague to Turkey and next year or this

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:43,480
year rather we will go to Strasbourg so

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,399
if you happen to be here to be in the

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,670
area considered to you to join it's a

00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:51,880
usually a free conference and you're

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:55,959
more than welcome to join and it'll be

00:15:51,880 --> 00:16:00,220
and of July right so Strasburg and off

00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:03,399
you like and who knows maybe you're

00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:05,860
there will be down for on this play or

00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,160
what will become known for so if you're

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,870
curious considered to go so we've come a

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:16,389
long way anyway since 2008 it's 2014 now

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:19,500
so this makes it six years old so it's

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:23,290
not as immature as you might think right

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,440
but still there's three point 12 is not

00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,870
it's not the act right then three is the

00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:31,060
whole thing and gloom point nine three

00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:34,060
point 12 it's just another iteration in

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:38,790
the efforts to bring well easy access to

00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:41,949
computers to as many people as possible

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,110
so how did we arrive that actually we

00:16:41,949 --> 00:16:46,329
sure do you need to make releases right

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:50,140
we have this this is cutting your

00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:51,670
caesar about how to make releases and

00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:55,240
then there's different schools of

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:58,480
releasing right and you could well go

00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,370
for quality based breezes that is you

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,070
don't want to have open blocker box say

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,400
you only reason every bought you

00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:08,620
consider both very important to fix or

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,510
you can go for well we just released

00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:13,689
every six months no matter what or every

00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,850
12 for them and we just well don't think

00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:20,079
it code and the throat of the wall and

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:22,689
make the release or you have a kind of a

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,839
plan and say well I want to get these

00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:29,950
features working satisfying enough and

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:31,450
then throw the corner global and so how

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,450
do we do it if we look at our history

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,610
we've been pretty stable impressing

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:41,590
least able actually however we

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:44,690
perhaps every six month we had a release

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,880
which i think is good not only for us

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,770
but also for the for the eyes vs we ship

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,690
now because they all can rely on learn

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:55,520
shipping every six month and actually

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:56,960
this is this has been shortened for

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,530
brevity reasons but it's been that wild

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,299
for for quite a while now so also the

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:07,520
next release will then following that

00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:09,140
logic PQ and off September so this

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:14,299
pretty much makes it a six month cycle

00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,820
right you know this is well it is well

00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:20,480
it has its advantages but also

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:24,919
disadvantages you know because it's not

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:28,190
only good to have the the cycle based on

00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,770
time because users do not want well the

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,090
users do not expect the news to be well

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,340
six months have passed there's release

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,530
right this is not exciting they want

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,669
something something more and that more

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:44,390
is will now case a strong feature based

00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:47,419
focus so before we plan a release

00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:49,730
there's a discussion about what shall

00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:52,760
actually go into that release and then

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:54,440
the community sides watch well shall go

00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:58,790
in this cycle of the next all the one

00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,230
off the next door well someone while

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:02,059
having these features there's always the

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,679
possibility that this kind of wrong

00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,640
write a feature cannot be completed in

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:10,010
time there's this this possibility so we

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:13,070
try to have a plan in case well that

00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:15,290
doesn't the feature is not ready yet in

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:18,020
fact we had the several times that we

00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:20,150
planned to let a pen that we plant a

00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:25,130
feature to go in but it was ready so we

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:29,150
ease you drop it so we do have a strong

00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:33,169
focus on timely releases like regular

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:36,049
releases but we mix we do not follow

00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:37,760
that purely we mix that with well

00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,770
quality based and feature based

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,049
approaches so we do have a list of

00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:44,210
blocker bugs as well before we before we

00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:46,400
release and we try to address these bugs

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,440
before we make the release and we have

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,850
several actually have several well

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,630
better releases

00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:55,520
one and well hopefully shaking out all

00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,720
the bugs that are still there that we

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,580
want to address before making the

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,919
release we are very good wiki page on

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,990
that so if you're interested in our way

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:05,090
of releasing things you can find it on

00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:08,090
the on the genome wiki think it's even a

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,770
genome de porc / start / unstable I

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:12,919
think and then you get to the to the

00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:14,360
schedule of how we plan to do things

00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,100
like there's a Canada and there's

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:23,000
releases and things we need to address

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:26,570
an alarm so as I said only following six

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,090
month and six month cycle is just too

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,400
boring right the news shouldn't be that

00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:32,960
well users use the new release six month

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,909
of pass that shouldn't be in the

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:41,059
announcement so with that we were able

00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:43,929
to release them three-point 12 March

00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:47,289
tiny sixth making it like four weeks ago

00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:50,809
and we have produced an awesome video

00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:54,230
for other release showing the essential

00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:57,169
features and also having the lovely

00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:00,950
voice of Karen's handler let's try to

00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:04,700
start the video again 312 is beautiful

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:06,280
working for a market-driven some of the

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:08,960
exciting things will be in the release

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,640
reef all times with a lot of polish to

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,950
crown shell and a number of these

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
features have no map locations and I

00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:18,350
thought the good news for developers out

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,570
there huge ball from speed for starters

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:22,669
now she'll go faster and uses fewer

00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,200
resources which is great because it

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:28,190
allows your computer focused on what is

00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:29,570
most important applications this release

00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,490
also brings improvements too many

software sources' update manually and

00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:01,770
certain increase performance along with

00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:04,050

have been made to bury it guys primarily

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,240
the cheap stuff crappies yeah which will

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,010
take a lot more powerful and G

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,940

keep hop over these will give you these

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,660
possibilities for creating a great user

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,929
experience and make your apps that much

00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,970
more off alongside video internal

00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:05,340
changes the documentation that you rely

your favorite to Nelson and overall no

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,270
free 12 there's a lot of expanding these

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:19,500
features to the table once again

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,970
improving our favorite desktop

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,280
environment and everything that comes

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,400
with it if you want to be a part of our

00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,410
efforts for snow join us here you look

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:31,820
forward to helping you get three my name

00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,820
is karen taylor and thanks for watching

00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:42,080
all right oh sorry for the quality is

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,470
the best we could come up so this video

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,780
is a duty Bastian also a young talent

00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,400
attacker from Denmark I'm very proud of

00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:53,660
the media actually it's I think it's

00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:57,410
been very nicely produced so on this is

00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:00,910
great three-point 12 well in short Eva

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:04,300
had roughly 1200 people contributing

00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:07,190
changes 35,000 changes that is roughly

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:10,040
and while this includes translations

00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,170
though but still yeah well actually if

00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,080
there's success stories to know it be

00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:19,100
translations and accessibility we have a

00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:21,050
strong translation communities and they

00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,360
actually pull amazing things off like

00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:24,700
translating twenty percent of all the

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,140
strings in just a day or so

00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,350
unfortunately the creation translation

00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,180
statistics is not as good as other ones

00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:34,490
so if you happen to speak well creation

00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:38,320
and if you want to engage that there

00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:42,560
will be an opportunity to help so the

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,710
most visible things foreground

00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:48,260
three-point 12 is probably the young

00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:50,270
software application that is all the way

00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:54,190
to install and remove an update

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:57,290
applications you there is a large effort

00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,570
due to Richard use to well get

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,480
statistics and screenshots and

00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:03,860
descriptions for pretty much well not

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,200
every application but for many many

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:09,980
applications yeah let's say it's a big

00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:12,430
airport and well this is very very crazy

00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,800
crazy amount of work it was really cool

00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:18,350
high DPI support also very exciting yes

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:21,590
there's new halfback coming on the

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:23,360
market with resolutions that are way

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:25,580
higher than what we are what we

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,830
traditionally used to this one has

00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,210
actually don't don't know fully know

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:32,180
what a resolution this one has something

00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:35,390
like 1300 x 800 or so but these crumble

00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:39,050
pixels have like at least four times as

00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:41,780
much or so yeah so if you have new hot

00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:43,230
pan you will be able to use known

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:47,880
properly on that or it will

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:50,220
nicely also we're trying to incorporate

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,520
new technologies like Wayland so you

00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,160
will be able to well use known except

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,360
ibly well on vaillant now which is

00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,620
exciting because this is the way forward

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:04,350
you know if you don't if you don't trust

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,110
me breda that Graham 3 512 is awesome

00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:09,600
then you might trust others who have

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,970
read you again three point 12 and they

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,850
said something like 93 point 12 pixel

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:16,919
perfect then three has finally arrived

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:19,650
well stating that this would be well

00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:21,240
probably the best guns really so far in

00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,610
this problem well I think it's free

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,200
right and high-resolution screens are

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,480
best manager underground three-point 12

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,059
or this is the memories I've been

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,429
waiting for so people are very excited

00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:35,130
I'm usually excited about this release

00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:37,470
if you haven't tried 93 in a while try

00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:39,780
grow three-point shots it's probably the

00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:43,620
most advanced release beef managed to

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,000
bring out so far so what is it what does

00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,320
it actually look like right you're all

00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,750
excited now and you want to see what it

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,830
looks like this is how it does so this

00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:57,299
is the name software software which well

00:27:52,830 --> 00:28:03,419
as the rest of Nome is elegant it tries

00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:06,179
to not provide well in it try it tries

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,790
to be unobtrusive in a way that there's

00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:11,090
clear buttons and clear functionality

00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,320
and it's clear what you can do then and

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,419
as you see you get screenshot

00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,419
subscriptions ratings and this is a

00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:22,110
large effort well to do that for many

00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:24,750
packages there all right this is a new

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,160
videos application if you're used to

00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,700
tote em this is what it will look like

00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:33,419
and it'll be designed for videos there's

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,820
a separate easy applications now but

00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:38,460
this one is that the video on you see

00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,320
again if it's slick interface it does

00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:46,140
not try to overhaul you with with

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:49,080
buttons and things to click on there's

00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:52,260
high DPI support as I've said you can

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,049
see on the left hand side is the old

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,920
version which did not support high DPI

00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:57,780
properly and

00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:02,940
right hand side you see it's much more

00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:06,540
smooth I hope you can see that there's a

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:09,980
wait and support so when you log in you

00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:13,940
have the option to all try Weiland and

00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:16,380
as I've said it works reasonably well

00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,090
there is a web and in the background

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,950
there is Reggie edit if you haven't

00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,740
tried web in a while well it used to be

00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,810
it used to be named Epiphany and it's

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:27,860
based on webkit so it's quite decent

00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:32,340
it's similar to say Safari on the Mac or

00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:36,600
do some extent chromium yeah and they've

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:38,040
got cool well as they are based on

00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,860
working a racket is progressing like

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,680
your app with on a very high pace this

00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,270
brings so many many new features and if

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,640
you haven't either no well give it a try

00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:50,040
it's actually not as bad as it used to

00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,670
be it makes it pretty decent digit

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:56,490
browser really we have a map send your

00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:58,050
location support now so this is the Mets

00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:00,240
application using open street maps you

00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:02,960
can see and we have the location

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,840
indication in these systems menu and

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:09,630
there's actually efforts to use open

00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,430
writing services to well to make you

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,400
enable you to plan your route and all

00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:16,740
that's quite exciting and there's many

00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,600
more tiny improve insignia three-point

00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,730
12 that hopefully make your day to day

00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:25,020
compute X computing experience of the

00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:27,150
much better and again if you haven't

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,220
tried to kill three in a while gives big

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:31,980
number three point 12 you give that a

00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,800
try but that's not the end right I mean

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:38,400
we haven't reached all our goals gaps

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:40,080
and we do plan for name three point 14

00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:45,870
which is you end of sep tember as I've

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:48,210
said and so far the most amazing things

00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:50,100
that we plan to do are probably using

00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,930
system d for the user session getting

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,700
rid of more coding our stack because a

00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,190
reducing code on our side is good right

00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,230
makes it more maintainable well it makes

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,920
it easier to use not only for us but

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:05,250
also for others and well the game user

00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:06,029
session was always or is always a bit of

00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,159
a

00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:10,409
hackett as it cannot track the session

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,070
reliably or as reliable as like lower

00:31:10,409 --> 00:31:15,389
level system components can another

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:19,080
thing we have been planning for a while

00:31:15,389 --> 00:31:20,309
is color tinting that is that helps to

00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,489
make free software much more accessible

00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:25,190
for people and as I've said one of these

00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:28,200
success stories of Nome is accessibility

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:31,229
so I think we lead the discussion in

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,139
terms of bringing software to the people

00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:35,639
not well and bringing something to all

00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:38,549
the people or to as many people as

00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:41,609
possible especially those were not

00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:44,099
physically as capable as say I am or is

00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:46,799
the most of us are and color tinting

00:31:44,099 --> 00:31:49,200
would be a way in as far as I know as

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,049
far as I'm aware it would be the only

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,919
way for free software to help those who

00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:57,899
cannot who have an impaired vision so if

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,659
we get that if we pull that off we would

00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,179
again or not again but still and further

00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:05,759
advance known strong position and

00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:10,559
bringing software to even well more

00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:12,809
people as I've said we have or we try to

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,879
have his umber integration to the

00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:16,889
desktop well mainly evolution the unit

00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:18,629
plan that is number as a group where so

00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:21,059
we will not only be able to connect you

00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:24,389
call up and exchange but then also to

00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:26,309
zimbra and i'm very excited to walk to

00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:28,409
see illusion gaining that capability in

00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:30,659
fact evolution is another thing that has

00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:33,389
tremendously changed over the last

00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:36,450
year's so i actually started my magnum

00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:40,759
korea with evolution coating on

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:43,919
evolution yeah it used to be very messy

00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:46,799
like the code has lots of technical dust

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,609
as it is like probably the oldest no

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:53,429
module it's probably still messy but way

00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:55,559
less messy than it used to be and that

00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:57,599
also the the interface also reflects

00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,940
that so if you have used evolution like

00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:02,460
a couple of years ago and well think

00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:07,669
it's not very good give it a try now

00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:07,669
it's it's gotten very much better now

00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:13,379
and thanks to all these people and many

00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:16,229
many more who made this possible knows

00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:18,659
about people after all so as I said we

00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:31,369
also a community we try to be happy

00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:31,369
US House happy with our users who is it

00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:48,529
all right right baby actually don't know

00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:51,299
who that is so for the actual change

00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:53,489
applications that we have because well

00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:55,409
expectation management right you have

00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:57,840
fused your g added for the last five

00:33:55,409 --> 00:34:00,869
years and this is what what it will look

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:08,280
like now it's been overhauled there's a

00:34:00,869 --> 00:34:12,950
slicker interface fair enough this is a

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,480
DNA three-point 12 you see fewer buttons

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,339
allowing you to concentrate on low

00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:37,440
editing your texts your talk hold your

00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:38,940
documents soft this is a photos so a I

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,559
think it's a JavaScript application even

00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,529
one of the few new JavaScript

00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:47,789
applications we have so it's quite young

00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:50,279
and well as as always it will kids still

00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:52,379
need some attention so if you a cue is

00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:55,710
to hack on a JavaScript application that

00:34:52,379 --> 00:35:00,750
might be one of them similarly we have

00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:03,750
videos the jab sab is a the new totem it

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:05,130
well looks different but it also allows

00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:07,859
you or not only does it look different

00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:10,650
but it also allows you to use streaming

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:14,029
providers straight from the interface so

00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:17,059
in this case it's a PVC thing I think

00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:21,799
another exciting application is Pilate

00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:26,700
it's also a JavaScript application it's

00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:30,270
it should become the IOC or well group

00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,530
chat application at some stage we have

00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:35,820
web as I've said

00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:39,060
it's again it's quite good and it has

00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:41,310
interesting features such as a a private

00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:46,350
boat that you can start from the command

00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:48,510
line I often use it web Dash P which

00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:51,150
gives me a private session and I know I

00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:54,000
can click all that from the Firefox and

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,370
and all but uh I think for me it's much

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,970
more comfortable Jesus fired up the 15th

00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:02,430
SP there we go and it's um well again

00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,960
it's quite good it's very fast it's a

00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:10,590
good decent browser good day today

00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:13,710
browser the journal journal viewer

00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:16,230
essentially blog viewer now we now that

00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:17,880
we finally after like 20 years have

00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,400
structured logging information from

00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,070
linux we can use that and displayed in a

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,230
structured manner which is a wall very

00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:28,830
nice it also a very very young

00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:33,240
application but not Britain JavaScript I

00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:35,970
think so what makes all all of that

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,860
right so we've presented you know home

00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:42,090
and and what it is and what it looks

00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:45,930
like but on how do we focus on what we

00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:48,060
do why do we do out so we as I've said

00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:50,040
multiple times we want to bring as many

00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,490
we want to bring free software to as

00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:57,830
many people as possible and that also

00:36:53,490 --> 00:37:00,540
includes to be as usable as possible to

00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:02,760
enable everyone to grasp the concepts

00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,930
well even if they don't have experience

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,120
with computing and we won't make it well

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:10,980
as per thousand as possible to use the

00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:13,170
computer because we think that people do

00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:14,880
not actually like to sit in the computer

00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,030
because they like to sit on the computer

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,430
but because they will need to do it

00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:22,410
because they want to get installed so we

00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,820
want to build enable them to do that as

00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:27,630
efficiently and as it as nicely as

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:32,790
possible yeah well how do we achieve

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:34,740
that we try to be very strong Ian things

00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:37,470
like localization international and

00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,960
internationalization accessibility so

00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:43,510
that everybody can use that we try to

00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,490
not single out a group of people

00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:48,700
only because they cannot speak English

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:50,950
for example or only because they cannot

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:54,400
type with two hands just for some reason

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:57,550
they just don't have two hands right so

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,740
we try to well incorporate everything

00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:02,050
that makes possible or that enables as

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:03,700
many people as possible to actually use

00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:07,750
free software because we actually

00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:10,420
believe in freedom so who can list the

00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:16,720
four essential freedoms that the GPL

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:21,610
guarantees anyone freedom changes one

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:24,540
right freedom to dispute right that's

00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,540
another one

00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,510
alright that's not one of the well

00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:37,500
modify the software to your needs and

00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,330
distribute that modified version is

00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,600
freedom number of number three in that

00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:45,320
case but there's a another or probably

00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,580
the most essential one freedom number 0

00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,050
actually to run the program for any

00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:53,210
purpose you have so we believe in all

00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:56,040
those freedoms and we believe that well

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:58,620
enabling people in first place to make

00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:01,700
use of the software is as important so

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:07,170
we try to be as inclusive as possible

00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:09,240
and again noms people as I said we have

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:12,720
like 1200 people working on the release

00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,670
so let's say I think it's rather big

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,590
effort a big joint effort and I'm happy

00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:20,100
for community exists and I'm happy

00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:22,410
 easy to well produce this

00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:25,890
software that hopefully makes the world

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:27,410
a better place and we are located well

00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:31,680
this night is a bit old unfortunately

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:33,900
but it gives an overview of what of our

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,350
distribution right now people sit in all

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,660
these places it could be more right

00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:41,430
there is no shortage of opportunities to

00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,410
help out that's that if you want to

00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:48,420
engage I invite you and well ideally

00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:52,260
this nav will be full of people who

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:54,390
contribute your own right so with that I

00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,780
want to close and i want to invite

00:39:54,390 --> 00:40:00,290
questions thank you very much oh that do

00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,290
we have a second

00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:14,930
okay how about the touch screens are

00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:18,050
just to support so gestures are a well

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:21,100
bit of a lower level thing right and as

00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:26,710
far as I'm aware gtk does support

00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:28,550
gestures but the well I think the

00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:31,670
applications do need to make use of that

00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:34,880
I'm not the technical person to talk to

00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:38,990
for gestures though and I'm not aware of

00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:42,170
any efforts to actually well have

00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:44,390
gestures of any kind indeed no three

00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,430
experience but that might change I'm not

00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,110
aware of our while all the things that

00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:50,450
people are planning obviously I mean

00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,490
with 1200 people it's a bit tough to

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,590
follow all them but if you have plans

00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:57,740
you're more than welcome to both

00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:59,960
proposed things right and we have the

00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:03,710
designers who take care of the design

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:07,750
and i'm sure by which they will listen

00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,750
to your knees and just cross these right

00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:21,790
okay i just want yeah i just want to ask

00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,650
about that technical questions so but

00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:26,500
you already said that you are not

00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:28,990
technical guy but I work but i will like

00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:34,030
to answer to him because I music gtk and

00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:37,660
cute but my basic question is to you

00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:49,780
guys from grown communicate with the

00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:52,210
guys from gtk that starting question yes

00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:59,410
okay now i will answer to him yes they

00:41:52,210 --> 00:42:01,720
put gtk adjusters in gtk3 but it's me as

00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:04,900
developer I always have problem with gtk

00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,940
and no I feel that I always missing

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,450
something there when I look too cute

00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:13,510
when I look to MEK AAP there is always

00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:15,610
something what is different but not a

00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:17,800
different in meaning of user but meaning

00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,100
for me as developer that I have to type

00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,680
much more code to get same result as

00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:27,550
with cute library or something like that

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,720
for example in gtk3 you have gtk entry

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:37,720
you know what is basic widget gtk entry

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:40,990
in wing in windows AP in cute in mac you

00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:46,360
can put any object inside that gtk entry

00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:49,750
in GTA 3 you can put only gtk image so

00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:53,050
I'm asking why who's designer of such an

00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:56,850
idea why I cannot put button for example

00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:59,980
inside gtk entry and that is my point

00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:02,260
why I'm always missing something when

00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:05,260
I'm developing with you TK yes i would

00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:09,550
like to involve myself in gtk

00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:12,970
development I want things to be clear

00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:17,410
and I want things to be a nice for

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:20,260
developers to make gtk entry with button

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:26,290
inside I need to write at least 500

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:27,020
lines of code and it's it it doesn't

00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:29,150
attract me

00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:33,980
as developer to write some application

00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:37,370
workload that's I hope that I was clear

00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,440
about it it's basic problem while

00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:42,980
applications are okay it looks nice and

00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,440
everything at the roots in the roots

00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:50,000
there is a problem with design of the

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:53,150
library that's my opinion thank you yeah

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,700
fair enough that's that the gtk folks

00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:58,280
could sure need some help as far as I'm

00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:03,080
aware this well a handful people are

00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:06,890
working on gtk itself on a regular basis

00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:10,370
which is of course well that could be

00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:13,550
improved saying and I'm I wouldn't be

00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:15,350
surprised if your issue was only q2 the

00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:21,290
lack of people actually make it happen

00:44:15,350 --> 00:44:23,060
issues in design when you when you make

00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,010
some library which will be used on

00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,170
windows so make on linux it doesn't

00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:29,840
matter if the buttons yes and no are on

00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:33,200
the opposite sides but the basic

00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:36,410
controls like gtk entry is its tea edit

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,500
control in delphi it's NS view one Mac

00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:41,420
it's Q line edits and cute they work in

00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,600
the same way you have to type some text

00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:47,930
inside as help you can have button

00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:50,720
inside whatever that button is I mean it

00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:54,410
can clear search filter but in gtk it's

00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:58,490
not button it's gtk image I mean I have

00:44:54,410 --> 00:45:01,790
not freedom to make it work like I want

00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:05,420
like I can do that on other operating

00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:08,120
systems on other viewing widget sets etc

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,190
etcetera that that is what i want and i

00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:14,000
would like to change because i like jtk

00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:16,130
and i'm still using gtk one and i said

00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,300
to Susa people please don't don't remove

00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:23,570
it from our distribution so it's that's

00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:26,180
the point the low level must be changed

00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:29,210
somehow it must be frankly for

00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:33,200
developers and then it will be easier to

00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:38,730
attract people to coding in gtk and for

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:41,550
no well thank you for your comments

00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:44,430
there's also the possibility that chica

00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:49,230
case not just the right library right i

00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:50,430
mean it's not particularly well it it

00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:52,560
probably does not try to address each

00:45:50,430 --> 00:45:59,369
and every use case that's it right there

00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:01,740
certain right so this is a shameless

00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:03,960
plug if anyone wants to use the lovely

00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:05,940
no group 312 that you've got there and

00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,820
in opensuse you have two ways of doing

00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:10,980
it now we have the gnome staple

00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:15,200
repository in OBS which we've tested and

00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:17,369
works on 31 my only word of advice is

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,830
don't use it if you want to have that

00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:23,400
and KDE because we had to update you

00:46:19,830 --> 00:46:25,109
power and we break kb in the process or

00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,430
if you want to use it with tumbleweed

00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:32,490
that went live yesterday so there's two

00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:37,410
ways of getting known 312 in opensuse

00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:40,200
13.1 but for 13 to we're going to be

00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:42,770
using them 314 because you fit perfectly

00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,770
with our schedule

00:46:45,959 --> 00:46:51,489
okay it was good news for myself but

00:46:49,449 --> 00:46:55,180
then I also have to support some people

00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:58,569
who are not so computer savvy what this

00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,459
show do i install on an old XP machine I

00:46:58,569 --> 00:47:03,190
get into my hand or something like that

00:47:00,459 --> 00:47:07,479
because I think opensuse might be a bit

00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:09,039
too technical for them and ubuntu might

00:47:07,479 --> 00:47:10,569
be the perfect match but then of course

00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,269
with old hardware you don't want to do

00:47:10,569 --> 00:47:14,529
that so that might be and the target

00:47:13,269 --> 00:47:27,099
group should be there but what is true

00:47:14,529 --> 00:47:38,529
delayers okay yeah the answer was use

00:47:27,099 --> 00:47:41,769
mint okay okay and maybe a question for

00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:46,269
myself but personally especially with my

00:47:41,769 --> 00:47:49,599
server guy I had on I think 80 times 25

00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:55,900
is fine and ice p.m. is luxury you

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:59,289
talked about 3d accelerated graphics and

00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:02,619
usability in one sentence i typically

00:47:59,289 --> 00:48:04,660
said to talk about 3d accelerated

00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:06,670
graphic and eye candy personally of

00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:09,699
course I candy is important for some

00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:14,890
target groups but not for me I use

00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:16,989
computers without eye candy so what can

00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:22,239
you really do in usability with

00:48:16,989 --> 00:48:25,630
accelerated graphics right thanks about

00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:28,059
and actually missed to address that

00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:31,329
point you know you're absolutely right

00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:33,670
we used to have this flood of eye candy

00:48:31,329 --> 00:48:35,170
3g accelerated i can use the accomplice

00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:36,789
thing right i think it was around two

00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,769
thousand nine or whenever it was and

00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:42,130
everybody was having the cubes and their

00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:44,529
windows burning in flames and I don't

00:48:42,130 --> 00:48:46,569
know I've just seen between all

00:48:44,529 --> 00:48:48,940
downstairs having half-transparent

00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:51,489
weekly windows and although we are not

00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:55,509
doing that we are like this video is

00:48:51,489 --> 00:48:57,729
actually quite innumerable it's not

00:48:55,509 --> 00:48:58,140
trying to be fancy it's trying to be

00:48:57,729 --> 00:49:00,990
useful

00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,119
and in our case when you start to

00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:05,579
achieve tease overview you actually well

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,769
what you see is the windows grouping in

00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,329
the activities overview and then if you

00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,619
leave the activities of you you see the

00:49:09,329 --> 00:49:12,809
windows going back where they were and

00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,099
in that case you know you see what the

00:49:12,809 --> 00:49:16,859
windows are where they came from so you

00:49:14,099 --> 00:49:18,539
can well spot these vandals more easily

00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:20,309
that you want to close or change to war

00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,769
that you want to move to another desktop

00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:24,690
so it's not about being having windows

00:49:22,769 --> 00:49:26,720
and flames or past transparent bubble

00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,740
windows when you move them it's about

00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,269
pollinating you choose your computer

00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:31,680
more efficiently so this is one of the

00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:35,849
examples and it's not that much right

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:40,430
it's not that much of 3d stuff we do

00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:44,460
only where we think it makes sense right

00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:46,380
and again there's this I was about to

00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:49,170
say classic mode the flashback mode

00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:55,549
which is a bunch of extensions that well

00:49:49,170 --> 00:50:01,440
give you and traditionally speak serif

00:49:55,549 --> 00:50:05,759
then there's some classics are all right

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,079
anything else all right thank you so

00:50:05,759 --> 00:50:09,480
much i'll be around anyway for the rest

00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:11,579
of the conference i usually don't bite

00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:18,359
so you may feel very free to just

00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:20,539
approach oh let me go awesome thank you

00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:20,539
