	openSUSE Team (@SUSE) is currently working on openQAv3. openQAv2 provide new concepts like needles and workers. For the next version we are providing mode improvements in areas like users, permissions, distributed workers and integration with OBS and Staging projects.

Now is a good opportunity to explain the internals of the application and provide the initial knowledge to help you to contribute to the project. We have many tasks that are perfect to gain experience in the application!
