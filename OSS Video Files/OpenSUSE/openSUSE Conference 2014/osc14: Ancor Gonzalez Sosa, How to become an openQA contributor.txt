Title: osc14: Ancor Gonzalez Sosa, How to become an openQA contributor
Publication date: 2014-04-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	openSUSE Team (@SUSE) is currently working on openQAv3. openQAv2 provide new concepts like needles and workers. For the next version we are providing mode improvements in areas like users, permissions, distributed workers and integration with OBS and Staging projects.

Now is a good opportunity to explain the internals of the application and provide the initial knowledge to help you to contribute to the project. We have many tasks that are perfect to gain experience in the application!

okay this talk was meant to be done by

00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:11,370
alberto planners but he was not able to

00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:15,839
attend finally to the conference so i

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:17,670
will try to explain the subject sure is

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,430
not the same you know the arena list or

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:26,039
with the Reno but I'll do my best so

00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:29,250
here is the fast and short version in

00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,260
case you want to leave to go to another

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:38,100
talk or simply because these studies

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:41,760
they last for today so the first of all

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,809
these doggies focused on contributing to

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,879
open QA like a tool I mean is target to

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,120
developers that really want to code on

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,059
on the tooth comb on the tool itself if

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,090
you are more interested in writing new

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,460
test for open qa4 for example for

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:02,750
improving the test coverage of your own

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,339
package or simply to a sick and tired of

00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:08,490
watching some recovering back

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,830
reappearing once in a while and there

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:14,790
will be a workshop about really writing

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,939
test cases to be run on open QA that

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:22,500
will be on Sunday by ludwick at 1pm I

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:27,000
think so this is this introduction is

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,189
about the open q8 tool itself so if

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,710
nobody leaves I will assume the least

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:37,619
interested on it so first thing he will

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:42,030
he will need to do is to go to github we

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,369
have a OS out ernst organization on yet

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,439
had where all the repositories related

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:51,720
to to open to a are so yes grab the code

00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:55,409
is / cold everything open case written

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,229
impaired even the tests we use several

00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,060
libraries from frameworks especially for

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:03,450
the server side we use module issues

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,899
with really nice / framework for web

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,060
development so and we have a in progress

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,480
that open source of org our read mine

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,300
for coordinating

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,629
we we failing our thing on also other

00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:20,720
teams we have a project called open QA v

00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:23,450
to you just go there there's a lot of

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,799
open issues task with since that means

00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:30,110
to be develop it or backs and everything

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:33,590
away within the team we try to work

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,930
using development sprint so we deliver

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,290
something new every two weeks so if you

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,510
go there you will see a spring 616

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:44,239
selling or whatever is the number the

00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,730
spring we're currently working on with a

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,459
list of issues already assigned to the

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:51,890
to that spring but you will also see

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:55,060
some kind of timeless verse young a

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:58,220
timeless milestone called easy hacks and

00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,950
this is where we assign all those tasks

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,049
that we would like to have fixed or

00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,200
implemented or whatever but we are not

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:08,599
focusing on it right now so that will be

00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,150
a perfect starting point if you really

00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,799
want to do something in improv dancing

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,200
up in QA of course you are free to

00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,389
implement whatever you want but if you

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,819
simply are simply looking for a easy

00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:23,230
task to get introduced to the code and

00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:27,650
everything just look for the easy hugs a

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:30,349
milestone version there and pick one fix

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:33,019
it implement whatever is needed and just

00:03:30,349 --> 00:03:35,780
create a pulley question indeed have and

00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,519
you are done and of course even more

00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,889
important how have the team that is

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,160
developing up into a right now is here

00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:45,200
in the conference so the even faster way

00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,200
will be just a pro class approach me

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:53,540
would be cool Christopher me help and

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,079
that's all from now I will simply repeat

00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,599
this but slowly with Maureen go off or

00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:04,879
kind of gory details with the URLs and

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:06,530
everything so and if i'm going to start

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,220
from the beginning let's do it properly

00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,590
explaining what open QA is i guess that

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,690
you will know because you are here in

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,099
the stock but open q is the tool we use

00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:21,229
to test openSUSE installation process is

00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:23,599
in fact not bound to open suse in any

00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:25,510
way you can regenerate tool for testing

00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:28,190
operating systems

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,190
the idea is that we have a small

00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:34,130
component called always out honest that

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,220
can take an ISO image and also how these

00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:40,400
several how these images and follow some

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:43,670
instructions about what needs to be test

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,580
for example it it creates a virtual

00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:51,470
machine introduce the CD into the unit

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:54,110
on for example press/chris down three

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,210
until you see the install too hard did

00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,610
option highlighted and then press ENTER

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,160
and then wait for the welcome to the

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,790
installation screen to appear if it

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,820
doesn't appear that lettuce has failure

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,770
its song if it appears next steps will

00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,910
be to choose this option or the other

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:17,930
option and so on all those tests are

00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:20,360
with an impaired also and they can

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:22,160
change the behavior depending of some

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,690
configuration those configuration are

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,250
read from environment variables and

00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,860
that's only they always out wins

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:34,570
component that does a very specific job

00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:38,360
and then we have open QA that really

00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:41,300
runs all this process of installation

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,330
checking for the result for a lot of

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,750
combination of for example installing

00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,640
the distribution with KD of with genome

00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:55,670
with different layout in the

00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:58,640
partitioning using lbm with you efi boot

00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,250
into a secure boot and all the

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,680
combination between so having different

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,180
file system on differing partitioning

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,180
scheme so when different hardware

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,300
whatever so it it's a lot of combination

00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,850
for each I so we publish or we won't

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,490
know that this that goes out of the OBS

00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:18,200
maybe not to the download servers yes

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,270
out of the obvious and we decide

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:24,860
depending of the result if it will go to

00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:27,470
the download servers and so the whole

00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:30,800
architecture looks like this more or

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:33,560
less there is a server this server side

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,170
with this grey there is the it provides

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,689
both the web UI and the rest api and

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:41,330
there is a database there where all

00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:43,999
the jobs that needs to be run all the

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,399
tests that are pending or that that are

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,860
having already executed and the results

00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:52,009
are there that's the server that

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,169
coordinates everything and then we have

00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:57,829
several workers running all the time in

00:06:54,169 --> 00:07:00,439
parallel a worker is a piece of code

00:06:57,829 --> 00:07:03,499
that is always running always asking to

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:06,199
the server through the distressed IP I

00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:08,929
do you want me to run some tests yes

00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:11,989
take this ISO image run it with this

00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:15,019
special configuration okay and what the

00:07:11,989 --> 00:07:17,899
worker does is filling a directory every

00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:19,639
worker have its own pool directory where

00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,539
it puts everything that always out in

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,329
out Owens needs to run it sets the

00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:28,489
environment variables that always on

00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:30,769
toys will use to decide which option to

00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:33,800
click or what to consider a fail or

00:07:30,769 --> 00:07:36,079
whatever and then it runs always on tour

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,029
in itself so this is the open q8 package

00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,999
it's a different repository and you'd

00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:44,449
have and it's also a different packaging

00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:48,259
movs and then it comes into play of all

00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:52,189
trains that is another package is in the

00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:55,159
same project we usually say yes open QA

00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:57,860
to too and we'll refer to the whole

00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:01,069
scene but they are in fact two different

00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:02,899
parts that simply runs once get the

00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:04,489
result back to the pool directory and

00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:08,289
the worker from the pool directory to

00:08:04,489 --> 00:08:11,209
the server and so goes on all the time

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:13,219
so now I can see in your lap in your

00:08:11,209 --> 00:08:15,860
eyes that you are already willing to

00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:18,199
start calling on this marvelous piece of

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:22,309
code so that's what you should learn

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:24,829
before of course lives will know pair

00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:28,219
because everything oh no pink you a

00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:30,110
spare there's document airing on

00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:33,529
internet that claims that can teach you

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:37,370
pair in two hours and a half and hour

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:42,019
better looks too mmm trust on it because

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:44,509
he wrote the around on the slides if you

00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:47,059
already know / you can save two hours

00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:51,380
and a half of your life if not it was a

00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,310
try and then you also will need to know

00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,890
the library

00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:57,620
sorry frangos we are using and the

00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,660
server side is gray part where you see

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,210
module issues with this a web

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,120
development framework that looks and

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,010
feels a lot like Sinatra the Ruby

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,860
framework for web development with means

00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:12,860
that it looks and feels a lot like rails

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:15,650
also because she not on rails are some

00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,230
kind of relatives so if you come from

00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,980
Ruby web development you will feel at

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:26,420
home or well like in some relatives

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,580
house with is good enough and for

00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,800
accessing the database there is a SQLite

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:36,020
database for storing all the information

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:39,380
we use dvx class with same object

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:43,190
relational mapping system this widely

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:46,010
used in impaired and in this always on

00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,830
to inspire is all about qmo of course

00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:52,839
because its basic basically a rapper a

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:55,490
wraparound qmo to run qmo with different

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,860
configuration and same cane strokes and

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,820
read the screen to compare the screen

00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:04,670
with the expected result and for this

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,940
matching of what you have on the screen

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:12,350
and what you did expect really we use

00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:17,330
opencv it's a great read great library

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:19,820
for for it we only use it for fuzzy

00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:22,640
image matching but can be used for image

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:27,110
processing for almost everything it's

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,060
really cool so if you already know that

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,250
of you are already aware that you will

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,740
learn all of this during the process

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,209
contributing just go to github as I said

00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,980
we have this always out on its

00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,620
organization there you will see the

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:43,550
repositories that one for open QA itself

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:45,140
one for the auto ins part and there's a

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,300
document explaining how you should

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,670
install everything the right directly

00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,600
from the repositories how to set up

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:56,270
everything if you simply want to go the

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,640
fast lane or see how it works first

00:10:56,270 --> 00:11:00,320
there are also packaging obvious the

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,380
packets are built the directory from

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,810
these repositories is the package we use

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,180
to deploy in production of an creative

00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:11,750
mr. ARP so if you go to subway del

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,279
visited or and look for open QA you will

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,620
have exactly the same that the

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,410
production server does you can usually

00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,240
just to check if your hand main

00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:28,510
installation looks like it's ruled and

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:32,150
as I said go to progress know something

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:36,200
okay got to progress the opposite of the

00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:39,680
arc this is the red mine instance we use

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:41,960
for within our team for coordinating our

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,760
daily world is also used by the admin

00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,460
team so every time you write email to

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,320
admin at opensuse or it creates an issue

00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,779
they are and they are minting

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,880
coordinates in this red line and also

00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:55,610
the board of project there for

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,760
coordinating so you will find a project

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:02,510
they're called open QA v to the URL is

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:06,560
open grave III historical reasons okay

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:09,610
about and there as I said you have this

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,460
special version with all the easy hacks

00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,950
you have the direct you are there and i

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:19,760
will just name a few of those tests that

00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:21,800
maybe are interesting to start with for

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,320
example we are missing pagination in the

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,660
job listing because we really test a lot

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,330
of combination for every I so which

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,670
means that we have a lot of tests they

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:34,760
are waiting for people to see the

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:39,110
results or just waiting to eat just

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,450
schedule it to rerun so this listing is

00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,630
all the sorting and everything is done

00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,839
by JavaScript so it's you don't really

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:50,360
need to go too deep into into open QA to

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,220
add pagination to it because the company

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,770
we're using already have some support

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,020
from pagination but you can also

00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:00,830
implement it server side and go one step

00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:05,660
farther quad and ishita to get in

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:07,430
contact the also if there is an escape

00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,910
job on this little and you click on it

00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:12,800
you see almost no useful information

00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,970
it's not a big problem for us but it's

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,370
kinda ugly so it's also a good a good

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,740
test two

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:26,230
get introduced to the two how their

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:28,089
templates are rendered and everything we

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,339
also have a workers view that the list

00:13:28,089 --> 00:13:32,950
of the words that aren't running so we

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:36,010
if some work at dies for some reason we

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:39,010
are aware of it but the right now is

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:43,060
quite hidden because there's no good

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:46,000
place in the in in the current layout to

00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,980
put the link to this worker view and on

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,140
the other hand we have a front page with

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:52,810
a lot of boxes saying to be implemented

00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,200
to be not the implemented yet so the

00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:58,660
idea would be to risk we rescue this

00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:02,830
hidden listen put it in one of those

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:05,890
fancy boxes in the front page it's good

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:10,210
task because you will see hold the the

00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:12,820
whole stack from the the server side

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:15,430
looks like you will see already written

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,410
list of workers with everything already

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:20,290
done but you will have to really

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:23,830
understand it in order to move it to be

00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:27,490
a component on a an area of another page

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:30,459
so also looks like a good test for star

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:32,589
if you are really one I'm finally the

00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:35,920
set up as you will see if you attend to

00:14:32,589 --> 00:14:38,380
the workshop about writing your own test

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,660
the setup is sometimes it's not

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,450
completely step step forward so you have

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,630
to do several steps in order to have

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,970
everything running and we really want to

00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:50,890
change that if you use the package it

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,200
will do most of the work that we really

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,940
want to have something that if you just

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,459
clone the github repository you have

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,790
something a script or simply a web page

00:14:57,459 --> 00:15:03,490
and wizard is up to you something that

00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,940
the first time you run up in QA you get

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,420
it all the database initialization and

00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:12,160
everything already done in an easy way

00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:16,360
also if you really are interested in to

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:19,630
deploy in it that will be also perfect

00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,640
us and there are several or task they

00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:26,230
are going through the whole list makes

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:29,200
no much sense so that's mainly all the

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:31,810
content so now it's up to you to make

00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,330
question don't forget that

00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:36,520
half of the people involved in the pink

00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,550
redevelopment is here so if you are

00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:41,380
watching the presentation on broadcast

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,510
sorry you miss the opportunity but if

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,540
you are hearing the room you have three

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:57,640
days to just contact us and as anything

00:15:46,540 --> 00:16:00,820
you need to know that's all since this

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:06,000
is the last tag of the day I save you

00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:12,970
more than 10 minutes I call it to my job

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,540
question over there hello there used to

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:20,020
be issues with one opensuse release then

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,810
there was not working memtest I don't

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,480
know if you remember this but mm clears

00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:27,910
how I covered the tester which are not

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,370
installation but I on the DVD like

00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:32,710
Kermit tempest if they are working well

00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,529
and if there is no problem with that

00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,930
well not all tests are only about a

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,570
installation if at we also test the life

00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:43,060
system so we have a test for the

00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,290
installation process and then we reboot

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,050
the reformatting and check that

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,000
everything is working and we have the

00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,339
same for the live system so we're at the

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,290
the distribution life and check that we

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:58,150
have network access you can perform ssh2

00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:59,830
yourself you can that the most

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,720
applications are there these kind of

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,310
things are already covered we are

00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,860
working on covering also updates so

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:10,390
installation sing with women with

00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,760
windows on the same matching on this

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,890
kind of thing so in fact everything that

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:19,569
can be running a machine can be tested

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:23,230
but yeah we are also testing that and

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:25,329
the members as well to memtest you know

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,339
there is a bum of the menu back boot

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,560
it's about medicine we don't have it we

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:35,620
have a test for mantis huh we have one

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:40,080
okay good yeah when there is a red

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,080
screen there is a problem okay

00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:58,210
hello is it a generic tool do you can

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,930
you test any distribution anything that

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:04,750
boots basically it's not just open

00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,880
society or you have some stuff in the

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:18,190
background that connects with the open

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:21,990
QA or someone to bring me the Mac the in

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:25,990
general the open QA framework is not

00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:28,870
specific to opensuse the tests are of

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:32,380
course open to the specific and there

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:36,250
are some tweaks necessary for opensuse

00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:38,559
for example how much memory you need for

00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,770
the vm for specific tests that might be

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:46,120
different and i think it was ported to

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,559
fedora debian and too so even tests are

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,860
running for these distributions and

00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:57,700
lately for what's the new name of man

00:18:50,860 --> 00:19:00,490
diva Mariah sorry sorry and of course

00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:03,100
they are of different quality because

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:04,330
you need to maintain the tests to the

00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:08,290
distribution but in general the

00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:17,110
framework of the of the things are not

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:19,210
specific to a person and how does the

00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:24,790
test configuration look like is it some

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:27,040
kind of XML or something like that or or

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,170
just when I said Wilco when I said that

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,500
everything is paired code I mean

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:38,280
everything is part about everything

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:38,280
spread code okay okay thank you

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,570
