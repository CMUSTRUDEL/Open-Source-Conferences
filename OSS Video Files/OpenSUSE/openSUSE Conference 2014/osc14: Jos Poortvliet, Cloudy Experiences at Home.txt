Title: osc14: Jos Poortvliet, Cloudy Experiences at Home
Publication date: 2014-04-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	ownCloud provides universal access to your files via the web, your computer or your mobile devices â€” wherever you are.

It also provides a platform to easily view & sync your contacts, calendars and bookmarks across all your devices and enables basic editing right on the web.

In this talk I'll go over setting up ownCloud at home, managing the installation, configuration and setup on a server and some clients. There are many goals one could have with an ownCloud installation. My goals are to share a bunch of files between my desktop and laptop and phone; and to allow my media center to play movies and show pictures.
