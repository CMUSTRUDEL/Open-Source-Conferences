Title: osc14: Jos Poortvliet, Cloudy Experiences at Home
Publication date: 2014-04-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	ownCloud provides universal access to your files via the web, your computer or your mobile devices â€” wherever you are.

It also provides a platform to easily view & sync your contacts, calendars and bookmarks across all your devices and enables basic editing right on the web.

In this talk I'll go over setting up ownCloud at home, managing the installation, configuration and setup on a server and some clients. There are many goals one could have with an ownCloud installation. My goals are to share a bunch of files between my desktop and laptop and phone; and to allow my media center to play movies and show pictures.

okay so a lot of you have already seen

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,760
this pretty much many times but I'm

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:11,700
gonna tell you again who I am what I do

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,710
where I live etc my wife who's not

00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,220
sitting over there but I didn't bring my

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,170
dog live in Berlin my name is your sport

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,500
fleets I work for own cloud which is

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,539
what I'm gonna talk about I help out

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:30,900
with giggle marketing and Katie

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:33,540
marketing so I have an hour I timed it

00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,219
to be more than an hour but considering

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,710
my previous presentation it was also

00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,690
time for more than hour ended after 37

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,700
minutes I can't promise i'll actually

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,950
talked for an hour but then you'll just

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,309
have to ask me questions until you know

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:50,010
we get there I'm going to talk anyway

00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,600
about out loud at home so really you

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,280
know like the kind of the page you

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,739
schedule phone clock really running it

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,140
at home I draw your own computer on the

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,109
mini server Raspberry Pi something like

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,320
that I'm going to start with you know

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,780
why owncloud was started in first place

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,450
what what problem is it trying to solve

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,090
and then I'll go over installation

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,630
configuration a couple of horrible

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:20,040
painful things and then we can a little

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,409
bit about contributing to it and time to

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,140
discuss at any point in time you can

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,299
interrupt me I don't mind I have my

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,710
slides to get back to where I was so

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:35,759
don't worry about that so let's start

00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:39,299
with the problem the thing on cloud set

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,400
out to solve now I really mentioned in

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,439
an earlier talk you know privacy is

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,909
becoming a and dangerous thing a little

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,000
bit these days well actually I think

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:52,020
we're already there by far I mean I

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,200
don't think the writer of 1984 could

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,869
even have imagined the little privacy we

00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,479
have today I mean in his world you could

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,820
just move in a corner of the room where

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,500
the television couldn't see you that

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,430
doesn't really do much these days

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,560
anymore

00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,780
I mean our mobile phones always follow

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,340
where we are the newest generation of

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,980
mobile phones has these really cool

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,310
chips that always respond to you when

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,200
you say ok Google they probably can also

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,410
do a lot more than just that obviously

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,610
cuz had microphones always running

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:27,390
actually if you think that's new you're

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:30,000
mistaken the older generations of phones

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,370
even the so-called dumb phones have

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,850
functionality that you can remotely turn

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:38,430
on the microphone and record that's

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:44,190
basically a default feature of pretty

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,900
much every phone since 1995 this is even

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,820
quite easy to hack you don't need to be

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:52,110
there service provider to be able to use

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,090
this function so yeah we'll if you

00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,320
really want to follow someone you can

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,830
but of course the thing that has changed

00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,110
that's not 2014 and the thing that has

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:03,600
really changed in in terms of being

00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,010
followed and in terms of privacy

00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:10,080
violation is that you know governments

00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,750
and companies don't really try to target

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,150
anyone anymore they just gather all the

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:18,660
day then store it in you know pretty

00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:20,190
massive storage centers and they mine it

00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,430
that just look for all kinds of

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:26,459
connections and relationships and you

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,200
know that's really quite useful

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,720
apparently for them because they keep

00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,850
putting in massive amounts of money on

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,170
storing more and searching more and

00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,230
they're not going to stop right I mean

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:43,140
the loss that they're bringing for and

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,600
that they're trying to get through the

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,700
parliaments basically give them more and

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,049
more rights to store and search and get

00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,600
more data so a lot of people say look I

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:57,780
have nothing to hide I put my stuff on

00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,390
facebook cuz i don't care honestly i

00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,959
have a facebook account and i blurt all

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:06,060
my users opinions out on google+ every

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,530
day and I use Twitter and all that stuff

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,620
so I totally get this point but as I

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:16,470
already said in earlier presentation

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:18,200
there is a lot more information in the

00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,230
stuff that you make public they

00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:24,140
you think I mean the friends you have on

00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:27,020
Facebook can determine by about nineteen

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:30,230
ninety-five percent accuracy if you're

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,760
gay or not now again luckily I at least

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,380
live in a country but that's all the big

00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,110
problem and I come from the Netherlands

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,120
there really isn't a big problem but if

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:41,210
you live in Saudi Arabia this can be a

00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,550
death sentence and that's that's kind of

00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,680
an issue right just your contacts on

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,000
facebook and not not your profile

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,490
information nothing out just your

00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,710
contacts apparently the people you talk

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,420
to are different when you're gaiden when

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,670
you're not which is actually an obvious

00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,620
thing and that's just one thing that's

00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,540
you see sexual orientation I'm pretty

00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,910
sure it also says a lot about your

00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:05,120
celery I bet that based on just your

00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,850
social graph you can guess your celery

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,920
within I don't know plus minus ten

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,840
percent maybe which is of course

00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,190
interesting for a potential new employer

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,230
because if they know more or less what

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,030
you make well that's quite helpful for

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:20,810
them in the solar in negotiation isn't

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,580
it so you know these things aren't

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,060
actually a lot more useful than you

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:28,070
think and they are out there you you

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,870
know they can be inferred based on the

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,670
information that you made public and

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,220
that you thought well nobody really

00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,020
cares about well there isn't a single

00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:38,570
individual probably looking at all your

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:42,460
data but there are a lot of databases

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:44,840
that have indexed it and that can tell

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,180
interested parties a lot about you a lot

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:52,070
more than you want them to know for sure

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,380
and that's just today I mean all this is

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:56,660
new all this is just being researched

00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,280
and a lot of money is being pulled into

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:01,010
getting more out of this data and

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,450
knowing more about what you do and why

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:04,010
you do it and how you do with an

00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,620
influence on you I mean I'm a

00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:08,570
psychologist and I kind of know that

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,030
there are pretty serious limitations on

00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,220
how you can influence people but I also

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,190
know that modern things like Facebook

00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:19,100
are actually massively strong and

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:21,700
influencing people I mean we used to

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:24,170
have advertisement and I know that about

00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,690
15 years ago there was a bit of this

00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:29,210
thing people were scared of subliminal

00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:31,090
messaging you know that you had a movie

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,460
running and then there were

00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:35,740
images flashed in its you know like once

00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:38,169
every 30 frames you might have heard

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,300
about this and yeah this was actually

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:42,490
done and this is something that actually

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,830
works as a matter of fact during my

00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:47,139
studies I did an experiment where I use

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,510
this technology to basically put words

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,620
in people's heads this really works if

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:56,280
you do this in a movie theater than yeah

00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,830
people will bring more coca-cola and

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,690
absolutely it is being used you know by

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,120
advertisements by the side of the street

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,120
which effectively are the same thing you

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,580
ignore them but your subconsciousness

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,880
does pick up on them and it does change

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,490
your opinions about the brand but these

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,979
things are not so strong yet the effect

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:22,270
of F of something like this that you see

00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:25,600
unconsciously is well let's put it this

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,490
way your brain kind of makes a hierarchy

00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,340
of how important certain information is

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,810
and this is really at the bottom I mean

00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,600
if you don't really care much about

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,820
politics and you go voting then your

00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:38,650
vote will absolutely be influenced by

00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:41,169
all those stupid advertisements at the

00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:43,419
side of the street that you see but as

00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,950
soon as you care only a little bit it

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:47,320
doesn't matter anymore because your

00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:49,720
actual conscious experience is so much

00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,700
more important than what your brain saw

00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,889
in a flash at some point by the side of

00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:56,349
the street so these things are not so

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:58,120
important and you know normal

00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,099
advertisement has personally never

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,789
really scared me because I know it's not

00:08:00,099 --> 00:08:05,889
that strong Facebook is different

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:07,389
because that Facebook is basically the

00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:10,990
information of your friends and your

00:08:07,389 --> 00:08:14,200
family now death is on that hierarchy of

00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,260
information scores extremely high a lot

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,630
higher actually than many of you think

00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,370
your opinions are much more influenced

00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:23,320
by your peers by your friends and the

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:27,340
social circles you hang around in then

00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:29,260
anything else education experience these

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,210
things actually less important than the

00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,620
opinions of your friends if you want to

00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:35,950
know what somebody thinks about

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:38,229
something ask his or her friends just

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,050
don't ask them what they think he or she

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,539
thinks not just ask or they think take

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,960
the average that'll be what that person

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,850
thinks

00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,820
the subject seriously this works

00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:51,010
incredibly well now think how do you

00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,260
know what your friends think how do you

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,270
think you know what your friends think

00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,850
well more and more you know that because

00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,620
you followed the Facebook stream can you

00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:02,080
imagine what a strength what a power

00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,410
facebook has of your opinion on the

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:07,150
world without you being aware of it

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,060
because it can filter what you see of

00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:12,070
your friends do they do that I don't

00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:18,040
know I mean nobody knows what algorithms

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:21,970
they use to show you the the list of off

00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:24,160
you know new items I mean they call it

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,590
relevance right how do they determine

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,390
that relevant you don't know and just

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:30,790
trying to give you a bit of an idea of

00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,770
what an influence these things have I

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,180
mean I could totally imagine that

00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,340
Facebook would make a lot of elections

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,930
in a lot of countries but just modifying

00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,270
the algorithms a little bit you know

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:45,220
like the party they like they just come

00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,600
out five percent higher in the results

00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,790
and the party they don't like five

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,730
percent lower I mean you'll never be

00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:53,590
able to prove that they did that but i

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,750
think it'll change the elections for

00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:57,550
sure especially in the country like the

00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:03,010
u.s. we have two parties in there three

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:06,460
percent different anyway so this this

00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:09,280
has a huge effect on our society and and

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,320
that's all assuming that this data is

00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,540
actually correct and there are quite a

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,870
few cases of people who got locked up

00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:19,330
for an even tortured for having the same

00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,640
name as a terrorist which isn't you know

00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,140
a nice thing to have really you know i

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:26,020
mean you can all imagine i think it's

00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,360
funny if you're cold you know Hitler but

00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:30,010
there are a lot more people consider

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,860
terrorists out there and if you just

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:35,470
look enough like them you might be

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:39,850
screwed you know and if you know how

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:43,120
easy it is to steal a and to copy over a

00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,070
fingerprint I mean this has been proven

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,560
actually by a hacker space in Berlin

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:52,270
which copied over the fingerprint of one

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:54,970
of the German politicians it's super

00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,530
easy while a terrorist could actually do

00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,800
that like an actual terrorist cuz you

00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,300
know they do exist

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,510
not as much as they'd like you to think

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,490
but there are some hour or just a

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,950
criminal they can copy your fingerprint

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:08,450
use it to do some stuff you'll get

00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,360
blamed they don't there are actually

00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:13,040
quite a few people who keep getting you

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,350
know the wrong speeding ticket because

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,570
they're wrong in the system well fig

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,029
fixing the system can be extremely hard

00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:23,180
especially if the system isn't supposed

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:24,980
to exist and secret or even illegal like

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,470
in case of the NSA I mean most of the

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,329
stuff they do despite what they say

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,550
isn't really legal or is being made

00:11:29,329 --> 00:11:34,010
legal right now now if you're wrong in

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,870
one of those systems well you can't

00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:38,329
complain because their systems don't

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:40,519
even supposed to exist if you're not

00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:43,339
allowed in the US you're not even

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,690
allowed to ask why because you know well

00:11:43,339 --> 00:11:46,790
they're not even supposed to know the

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,310
stuff that they probably denied you

00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:53,930
access for in the first place so again

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:57,470
these things it's not cool okay this

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:59,600
really isn't cool now I'm not saying you

00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,459
know I have the one solution for this

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,500
because obviously you know this is a

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,750
problem that we need to do something

00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,940
about on every single level I mean

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,360
there's a policy problem a political

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:14,690
problem the social problem awareness but

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,160
it is also of course technical and well

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,990
the technical side you can solve by

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,079
ditching your smartphone and you know no

00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,240
longer using the internet but I think

00:12:21,079 --> 00:12:25,550
for most of us you know internet comes

00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,520
first and food comes second so that's

00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:32,120
not really much of a choice right so

00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:34,160
well at least there is a bit of a

00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,800
solution right there are some solutions

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,230
but what do they need to have I mean the

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,740
solution of course needs to to protect

00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,899
us right we need to own around data it

00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,970
need to make sure that you know we can

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:50,240
control who can look at the data who can

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:53,000
index it you know get all the

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,769
information together and make all these

00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,019
conclusions out of it at our governments

00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:58,399
and companies are not doing we need to

00:12:57,019 --> 00:13:01,519
be able to control that so it needs to

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,959
be encrypted the software must be open

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,519
source I mean if you don't know what

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,160
running on the server that you're giving

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,839
your data to well then what the heck are

00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,310
you doing right you shouldn't be giving

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:11,480
that data to that server that you need

00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,639
to control it

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,459
so the encryption for example needs to

00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,610
happen on your local system or it needs

00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:22,639
to go via a server that you own ideally

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:24,620
even physically and that I know that's

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,060
quite some requirement most of us aren't

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,550
really capable of running a server at

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,079
home but then it needs to be encrypted

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,089
on your client on the system you're

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,430
running it's possible you know I mean

00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:37,760
why do you think Google lets your phone

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:40,160
do voice recognition in the cloud the ad

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,930
performance I mean seriously uploading

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,399
something to a server somewhere and then

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:45,380
doing the voice recognition and then

00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:47,300
downloading again is that going to be

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:49,070
faster than having a dedicated chip in

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,260
your phone Adele voice recognition I

00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:54,019
don't really believe that and even if it

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:56,209
is I would still prefer to use a little

00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:59,269
bit of electricity to do it on the phone

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:01,010
itself they upload it because well it

00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:03,589
helps them to create the database of all

00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,389
these voice fingerprints that's awesome

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:07,519
right I mean they can use it for lots of

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:10,010
things of course they use it now to make

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,899
the voice recognition better and if

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,699
someone really wants to they can use it

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,040
for a lot of other stuff including for

00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:17,779
its recognition and faking that if you

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,000
use that to get into your house at some

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:22,040
point in the future Google's database

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,940
will definitely be able to break that in

00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:27,170
no time which is really nice for them I

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:32,420
know these are all things that are a

00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:34,370
little bit far away in that's politics

00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:36,829
what does what often comes up is what

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,600
happened in World War two for us before

00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:41,750
World War two the netherlands at some

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,430
point they were I mean I know Germans

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,620
are known to be bureaucrats but that's

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,690
they can hold their own absolutely and

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:50,149
they come up with the idea to register

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:53,240
where people come from like their their

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:57,079
heritage basically so they registered

00:14:53,240 --> 00:15:00,319
that like all over the Netherlands so

00:14:57,079 --> 00:15:01,940
when the Germans in 1941 came to the

00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:04,519
Dutch local government and they wanted a

00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:07,130
list of all the Jews in every city five

00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,209
minutes no problem sir here you go so

00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:10,850
the Netherlands had the highest

00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:14,690
percentage of Jews deported then well

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,339
you know what happened so this is

00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:18,980
something and the Netherlands if they

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,779
talk about storing data this often comes

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,520
up I know a lot of other countries

00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:26,550
haven't had that experience but

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,590
it's a nasty thing so whatever solution

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:32,490
we have it needs to stop this kind of

00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:35,580
stuff yeah it's serious and at the same

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,590
time we are used to a lot of really nice

00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,690
things i mean i love google plus i know

00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,460
a lot of people say it's dying and or

00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,740
dead or something the whole ghost town

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,080
thing for me it's awesome I use it to

00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,690
follow a lot of really interesting

00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,810
people all over the Internet I really

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:53,520
love it and Facebook well I have a

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,710
little too many people on there because

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,020
you know it's two-way stuff with the

00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,940
friending so I have like I don't know a

00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,590
thousand people friends because every

00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,770
conference I go to everybody there wants

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:07,200
suddenly to be well I follow on facebook

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,240
so that's little overkill but it is nice

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,390
to follow my friends and family right

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,010
especially my mom he sees on facebook

00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:16,890
and only your facebook i mean you know

00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,830
she has my ipad now that kind of works

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:21,630
but that's also kind of i don't think i

00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,280
need to tell her about google+ that's

00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,010
kind of pointless I'm already happy that

00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,870
she can actually send emails these days

00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,510
and so for a lot of contacts you need

00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,300
these social networks so whatever

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,970
solution we built it needs to be really

00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:38,820
easy it needs to be easy to deploy easy

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,440
to administer easy to use it needs to

00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,780
have all this functionality we're used

00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,640
to and if you want to collaborate with

00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,610
someone on the document you send them a

00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:49,380
dropbox link it's going to work you know

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,970
it's going to work if you update file

00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,770
the other person will be able to get the

00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,600
newer version because it's easy to use

00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,760
that can install the dropbox app on the

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,200
phone you need all that stuff all that

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:01,830
functionality to sharing the

00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:03,420
collaboration with limitation that needs

00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,470
to be secure I mean these are not easy

00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:11,250
problems they're not easy to solve but

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,980
if it's not easy it will not be used now

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,920
owncloud is at least a part of this

00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:19,589
solution it doesn't solve their Facebook

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,720
side of things but the does solve the

00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:25,110
control around data share it with people

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,390
and work on it together it offers you

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,270
control of your own data ownership of

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:32,250
your data so on clouds it's a server

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,530
solution it's something you run on a

00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:36,360
little server or even on your laptop I

00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,330
mean I had it running on my laptop at

00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,450
some point

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:44,140
it's quite easy it's a about four years

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:48,370
old man as a project our source code is

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:51,250
a GPL their Pharaoh TPL with guarantees

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:53,049
that if it's running on the server then

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,120
the owner of the surface legally obliged

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:57,640
to give you access to the full source

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,490
code of what running on that server now

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:03,850
the a GPL is like the GPL banan for

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,610
servers if you use a server technology

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,529
and you want to make sure that it does

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:11,350
what you want it to do it needs to be a

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:14,350
GPL okay GPL is not good enough for

00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:17,320
servers because the server can run GPL

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:19,240
software but that means it's running on

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,639
their server and the GPL doesn't require

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,799
them to give people who access that

00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:26,230
server remotely access to the source

00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,740
code which means you can't inspect what

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,899
it's doing even though it's TPL so you

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:35,889
really need to a GPL for this and that's

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:38,320
what the uncloudy lysis guarantees you

00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:41,409
you know that it runs what it's supposed

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,490
to run now we've build a company behind

00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:47,350
this owncloud Inc the case is that a lot

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,029
of companies and organizations do not

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,260
want to share the codes of what's

00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:53,139
running on the server with their

00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,730
customers well we don't like that that's

00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:57,190
why it's a GP on the first place of

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,799
course but if they really don't want to

00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:01,990
give away the code to their customers

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,669
fair enough payers money and you can

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,500
take greater freedom of your customers I

00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:08,830
mean hey that's a business model and

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,169
that business model has helped us to get

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:13,600
a lot of people paid full time we have

00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:15,909
now about 50 employees obviously not all

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,159
engineers but about half of them they're

00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:21,000
working full-time and uncloudy so that's

00:19:18,159 --> 00:19:23,320
what these customers are paying for and

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,049
we offer them of course commercial

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,440
support on top of this we do development

00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:32,159
for them well we have quite a bunch of

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:35,740
pretty high-profile customers including

00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,750
that little ring that they have that has

00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:40,480
discovered the Higgs boson it's a name

00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:43,269
CERN pretty cool to have certain as a

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,700
customer of course they are quite cool

00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:47,990
also a whole bunch of universities all

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,780
over Europe and the US and

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:53,420
so well I can't share unfortunately a

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,250
lot of the names of our customers but a

00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,010
lot of them are really like what they

00:19:55,250 --> 00:20:01,179
are customers I only joined the company

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:03,830
recently so i'm so excited about that so

00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:06,200
what can i do right because the features

00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:08,750
are important as I said well it can sync

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,110
your files between your systems as in

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,870
mobile phones and we have iOS client who

00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:17,000
have android client at the moment and of

00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:20,230
course a web client we have a desktop

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,900
client for linux for Mac OS X for

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:25,340
Windows and of course it can sync all

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,179
these files between these clients and

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,950
the server you can I share them any file

00:20:29,179 --> 00:20:32,480
anywhere it's even more flexible than

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,960
something like Dropbox you can just

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,380
choose any file and web UI if you mouse

00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,380
over it you it gives you basically share

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:45,470
link you can either add an account for

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:47,630
that person to share with that person so

00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,360
that they can actually upload changes we

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,890
can also generate a link that also can

00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,270
allow them to upload changes so you

00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:54,530
don't need to create account for every

00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,880
one you want to share with you don't

00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,100
need to put it in a special sharing

00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:02,120
folder it's actually really a very

00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:03,710
powerful solution it's working very well

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:06,200
they have really full access rights

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:08,960
because I read only read/write can only

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,940
modify can create files in the folder I

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,059
mean it all the good stuff is there that

00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,190
you would need to work with people I'm

00:21:14,059 --> 00:21:18,170
glad was easy to install and it's easy

00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,170
to run at home and it's also very easy

00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:24,760
to hack on and to improve these things

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,870
are really important for us now it's PHP

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,460
that might not be the most perfect

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,070
technical choice and a lot of people

00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,100
don't like PHP but think about it it

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,679
runs everywhere okay you will not be

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,860
able to find even the cheapest simplest

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,980
web hosting that cannot run a pure PHP

00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:45,140
application that means it runs anywhere

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:47,630
for 34 bucks you can get a web service

00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,059
somewhere where you can upload your own

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:53,090
cloud administrate yourself and control

00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:55,340
what it's doing and okay you get only 10

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:56,840
megabytes of space or 20 but that's

00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,150
enough at least for your sensitive

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,980
personal data for your txt files for the

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:03,710
basic stuff that you need

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,590
and I'll get back later to that you can

00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:09,290
actually use external storages and fully

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,450
encrypted as well so it it really can

00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,850
solve the problem for you in an easy way

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,820
and it's easy to contribute to its easy

00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:19,850
to extend my wife I always called her on

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:24,169
this one has set PHP programmers grow on

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:27,919
trees 9 a lot of people now PHP and it's

00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:32,390
easy to learn so this really helps us to

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:34,850
get contributors as well and they have

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,700
lots of other fancy features it has

00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:41,600
backup it is versioning built-in it does

00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:43,370
encryption of your files it can do

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,830
external storage which can be fully

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,870
encrypted as I mentioned so what you can

00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,270
actually do is you can have uncloudy

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,820
installed on your own server and then

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:56,480
you connect it via the external

00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:59,000
connector to Google Drive and now you

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,220
turn on encryption and then you have a

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,169
hundred gigabyte of space for almost

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:06,169
free on Google servers because you know

00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:07,580
for Google space is very cheap which is

00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:09,890
of course because the index all your

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,299
files except that they can't because

00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,090
they'll be encrypted by own cloud

00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:16,429
transparently you won't notice but they

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,520
don't get on your data anymore game over

00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:22,190
I mean that's pretty cool right so you

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,220
can actually have your cake if the cake

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,410
is security and either too if eating it

00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:33,530
would be you know having a lot of cheap

00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:35,330
space it has apps so basically a lot of

00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,730
functionality and own cloud is actually

00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:39,950
delivered an abscess very modular you

00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,720
have apps for ball I mean music and

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,900
video viewing right in the web browser

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,299
and pictures and real-time document

00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:50,270
editing yes sir we've got you can open

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:52,580
ldf file and actually edit it you know

00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:57,530
on the server save it real time with

00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:01,780
multiple people really cool RSS reader

00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:04,669
notes to do lists syncing you know a

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,380
calendar application that can sync with

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:08,000
your local calendar application you get

00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,010
an address book you can sync if your

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,690
local address will keep it all or your

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,419
own server doesn't have to be at Google

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,799
anymore

00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:20,580
one or two so it really has a big cloud

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:23,070
of features it's quite complete and

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:24,929
again if you want other stuff is very

00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:27,419
extensible it's really easy to write a

00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:30,059
new app for it and you know do new stuff

00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:35,759
I'll get to some information about that

00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:37,529
later now as I say that there are other

00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,269
problems out there I mean this is not a

00:24:37,529 --> 00:24:42,299
solution for facebook this doesn't

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:45,809
replace Google+ or skype or snapchat or

00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:47,549
all these other functionalities there

00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:49,259
are actually people working on some of

00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:51,149
these things there are apps being in

00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:54,210
development or people talking about apps

00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:59,330
that can do you know almost also email

00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:01,919
that can do also you know social media

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,049
all these this stuff it is possible

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,299
there's no reason uncloudy couldn't do

00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:08,340
all this stuff it's just we first

00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:10,859
focused on one thing which is your files

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:14,159
your personal private data that should

00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:19,350
be somewhere safe and secure not on an

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,460
server you don't know where but if

00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,200
you're interested in this stuff

00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,399
obviously you're very much welcome to

00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,940
come out and help us now I'm gonna go

00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:31,379
now simply over the installation of it

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,850
again I'm rather than you or down cloud

00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:35,100
so this was an interesting challenge for

00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,519
me personally as well if you've got a

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:41,820
laptop here with you it's really easy to

00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,379
install this is basically bordering or

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,789
boring especially if you run out in

00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:47,909
Susan because there's a one-click

00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:49,470
install for it and it is as simple as

00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:51,149
clicking the one-click install and

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,739
saying you know yes please install this

00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:55,980
well you all know I one click and saw

00:25:52,739 --> 00:25:57,929
works i suppose and then run apache

00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,759
that's all you need to do there's

00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:03,590
nothing more to the installation it'll

00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:06,299
work after that I do have one tip though

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,980
especially if you want to run it at home

00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,989
I think this is really something you

00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:14,249
need to keep in mind I mean it uses by

00:26:09,989 --> 00:26:16,919
default SQL Lite now for 20 megabytes of

00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:18,720
web space at the provider somewhere SQ

00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:20,519
aligns perfectly fine it's fast enough

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,909
and of course it requires no setup

00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,700
whatsoever I'd really start up you know

00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:27,190
a patty

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,710
and you know you go to your local host

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:33,010
and that's on clock running and you add

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,460
a user account and there are your files

00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:37,980
you can start sharing them you can i

00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,780
connect it to a mobile app you done a

00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:42,280
but if you have it at home and you're

00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:46,030
going to connect you know your 3

00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,380
terabyte of movies to it sqlite is going

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:49,150
to bite you in the ass because it can't

00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,200
really deal with that so then you need

00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:56,800
to set up mysql that really it's not

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,040
hard I mean after the installation you

00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,450
know you just start up a patchy system

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:06,220
CTL startup etsy to start up mysql and

00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:08,590
then you can set up mask well on the

00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:10,120
console we have good how to's online on

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,370
our website on how to do these dishes

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,800
actually the commands you need to run

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:17,770
but document the link there tells you

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:22,150
it's it's simple but it needs to be done

00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:23,740
because you really need to have a decent

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,390
yeah you need to set up the database

00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,390
first before you can connect to it

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:30,190
creddie user it's rather trivial even if

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:33,040
you have never done it before like i had

00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,510
i did this all was no problem for me so

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,460
seriously this can't be a problem for

00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:38,500
any of you ok seriously I'm a

00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:42,940
psychologist I could do this and if you

00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:45,010
can I guarantee it if you did something

00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:47,710
wrong with the database I even learned

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:49,900
the term drop database on cloud which

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:52,600
apparently does exactly what it you know

00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:58,510
says you can start over with the

00:27:52,600 --> 00:28:00,610
database and recreate it yeah after

00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:04,060
you've got it up and running really you

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:07,810
go to 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot one or two

00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:09,460
localhost and you get this that that's

00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:11,470
all there is to it you just enter your

00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:14,500
username and your password that you want

00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:15,940
the first user is admin and you hit

00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:18,040
enter and you're up and running if you

00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,890
did mysql then you need to click on

00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:23,070
advanced enter the details again the

00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:27,430
how-to is really simple about this and

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,380
then yeah really that's all there is to

00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,650
it it'll be run and you have your files

00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:34,900
you have your access to everything it

00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:37,210
shares it already makes versioning you

00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:40,380
can already do backup enable apps

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:43,480
do the Sharia do the sharing do the

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,580
everything it works so if my

00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:47,500
presentation was only about this then I

00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:51,490
was done but luckily I have a little

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:58,210
more troubleshooting why I got stuck on

00:28:51,490 --> 00:29:00,899
this I didn't run this command so this

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:04,360
is necessary for apache two loads

00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:06,100
modules like PHP support because at some

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,230
point I don't know what I screwed up but

00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:11,110
I got every time when I went to

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,840
localhost it will try to download a PHP

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:15,730
file instead of Cheryl web page turns

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,380
out that you need to have peer to be

00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:24,010
running for a PHP f to work it sounds

00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:27,460
obvious but again for me it wasn't so a

00:29:24,010 --> 00:29:30,130
2 and mods minus L you see all the

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,230
modules that are on your system with

00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:34,059
minus D you can disable them and with

00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,399
just a 2n mods and then the name of the

00:29:34,059 --> 00:29:39,010
module you enable them basically what i

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,020
will do is if you have trouble look here

00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:45,669
first because that was the easiest thing

00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:47,260
that bit me in the ass but yea even this

00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:48,850
troubleshooting a simple because there's

00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:51,220
just very little to screw up of this

00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:55,899
which i think is really good thing right

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:57,669
now i want to go and show you some of

00:29:55,899 --> 00:29:59,230
the things you can configure just to get

00:29:57,669 --> 00:30:03,880
a little comfortable and uncloudy what

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:06,640
functionality it has yeah just get going

00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:09,309
in it basically now if you go to your

00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,890
user so you click on you know the user

00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:14,590
on the top right and then on personal

00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:19,179
you can even add a nice profile picture

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:21,220
of yourself yeah you can set your own

00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,169
email address you can change a password

00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,909
it's all very simple if you forget your

00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:27,490
password there's functionality building

00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:32,740
to get a new password it's always

00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:35,169
obvious as it gets if you go to the user

00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,179
configuration then basically you can see

00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:39,580
the users you cannot users remove them

00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:42,100
set their access rights and also limit

00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:44,440
how much storage they can handle but

00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:47,799
again it's simple it does what it's

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,980
supposed to doing a little more when you

00:30:47,799 --> 00:30:51,260
go to the admin

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:56,590
then you might see some red things

00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:59,540
warning you first it says is enable ssl

00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:02,510
which is basically encryption of the

00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,190
connection to your own clouds as long as

00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:06,530
you run it at home you don't need that

00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,840
per se but as soon as you want to access

00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:10,940
your own cloud over the internet well

00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,679
sending all your files by plaintext kind

00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,960
of defeats the whole purpose of you know

00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,400
having something on your own that can't

00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,750
be tracked by the government or

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:24,640
companies right so you need to install

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:28,100
SSL and I also had a problem I believe

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,260
yeah the PHP module file info this is

00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:35,710
not mandatory but it's something you can

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:39,290
install the zipper in PHP 5 desk foul

00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:42,140
info so it's just a model you install

00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:45,140
after you restart apache it'll then have

00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:47,090
the ability to generate previews of

00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:50,390
files and stuff like that so there's a

00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:53,419
bunch of extra things you could install

00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:59,360
that you know the manuals all talk about

00:31:53,419 --> 00:32:02,330
it harder part is SSL um seriously you

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,250
want as a cell you really do because

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:07,640
that means you can encrypt the stuff

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:09,380
that you're doing and unfortunately well

00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,210
this is outside I mean you've seen our

00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,490
simple own cloud is but outside of what

00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:15,080
I'm cloud can control and 40 things are

00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:17,570
not that simple and this is just you

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:20,600
need to configure apache to do this

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,730
luckily if you know Suzy user it is

00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,679
about twenty six orders of magnitude

00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:27,559
simpler than on any other distro how to

00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:29,990
that I could find because it has a

00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:33,799
couple of really nice commands basically

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:35,690
this is what you need to execute this

00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:37,549
already looks complicated I know but hey

00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:40,250
the security it's supposed to be hard

00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:45,919
apparently don't let blue tree here that

00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:49,790
I said that but the second command here

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,679
jen ssl cert that's what creates a ssl

00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:54,020
certificate which is necessary for the

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,230
encryption of the connectivity or laptop

00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:59,450
or your phone and your server this is

00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:01,970
the part that almost other linux distros

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,250
takes about two pages of how to

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:05,630
and is here one command so that actually

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,060
saves you a lot of work if you just

00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:10,460
enter enter this command it'll create

00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:14,240
the certificates then you need to enable

00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:16,430
the encryption well again the commands

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,010
are here and don't think it's very

00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:22,280
useful to read them up out loud and

00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:23,930
again the documentation that's the

00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:26,720
opposite of documentation for enabling

00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,430
ssl encryption on your system so if you

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,200
go there you'll find it very easily i'll

00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,640
put my slides online by the way so you

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:35,870
can all look this up you don't need to

00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,700
write it down and at that point you know

00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,740
it's safe I mean it's a self-signed

00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,480
certificate so your your browser in your

00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,670
application tool complaining about it

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,420
but I'm guessing you trust yourself at

00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:51,980
least so you can go I okay this is cool

00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:53,660
it works first part of configuration so

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,950
yeah that that's cutie want to start

00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,540
with that because I think it's really

00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,510
important to have at least ssl

00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,010
encryption it's not the only thing

00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:03,770
because the cool thing about uncluttered

00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,840
apps right now the bottom left of your

00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,730
screen is plus because you know there

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,760
are your app so the plus says more apps

00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:13,280
right it's reasonably obvious our

00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,840
designer has a genome guy so he has a

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,340
certain few on things in the world

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:21,230
tonight usually like it it's very simple

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,720
well you have a couple of standard ones

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,080
are running I mean files I'm thinking

00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:29,930
you can guess what's their activity that

00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,820
basically shows well the activity like

00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:35,000
you know this file uploaded this file

00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:37,450
deleted you know world resets blob of

00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,990
light it's all in there and list

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:45,770
documents again shows you your documents

00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:48,680
pictures calendar contacts PDF viewer

00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:50,480
text editor yeah I mean text editor is

00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:53,180
really building if you just have a text

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,950
file you click it you know you come just

00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,750
a few it you can edit it click on save

00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:58,310
and it's done really nice not

00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,710
collaborative so if other people added

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:03,560
at the same time that doesn't work you

00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,440
need to have the collaborative document

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,420
editor for that so video fewer and

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,970
deleted file so you can get the files

00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,980
that you accidentally delete it back

00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:15,710
ownCloud is by default pretty smart of

00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:17,330
this if a file gets deleted

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,030
you know it'll keep that around for a

00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,859
pretty long time not forever it cleans

00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,960
out you know otherwise your storage

00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:26,690
would really balloon right it has

00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,830
something like you know it keeps the

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:34,190
last revision of every file like every

00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:36,080
change for a second and on every one for

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,609
every minute and one for every hour and

00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,960
one for every day and something like

00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:41,930
that so it has a reasonably smart

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:47,660
algorithm to keep files but not keep

00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:49,970
every single change around this is it's

00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:55,609
possible to modify this I believe but I

00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:58,790
have no idea now I'm going to go over a

00:35:55,609 --> 00:36:01,040
few I think cool / importance let's just

00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,230
awesome apps and the first one is

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,410
external storage now I already mentioned

00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:08,000
this own cloud can handle storage which

00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:09,859
is actually not on the own cloud server

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,830
itself or at least not in its own data

00:36:09,859 --> 00:36:14,869
directory so you can have either local

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:16,670
folders that are you know on the same

00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:19,550
server but not in the own cloud data

00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:21,890
directory your movies music you can just

00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:24,200
mount them in that's really easy but

00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,480
also remote protocol Samba and the vests

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,670
ftp eats or supported they can grab the

00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,170
files from there and then all present

00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:32,330
them in one interface so you don't

00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:34,580
really have to butter where you're fast

00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,760
come from it just shows them all in the

00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:39,950
files it indexes them etc and it has

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:47,480
cloud storage support Dropbox Google

00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:49,760
Drive a couple more so to do this you go

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,520
to you well you first enable the app and

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,839
all right well here you click on the app

00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:56,690
name and then you click on enable

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,330
there's not a lot more to it and then

00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:02,420
you go to admin to configure the

00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:04,280
external storage so you give a folder

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,520
named that's the name on your own clouds

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,740
you know in your list of folders and

00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:16,099
then you give to the location you are

00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:18,770
details if the black or if the Red

00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:20,240
Square is you know red and square then

00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:22,640
you did something wrong there's a type

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,280
of somewhere if you fix that it becomes

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,440
around and green someone thought about

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,140
that so-called black people still

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:33,760
get it although I don't really see how

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:37,910
square is inherently wrong but you know

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,880
I'm not the usability guy but yeah Green

00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:42,410
is working working so you're good to go

00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,030
hover over the item to the right and

00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:49,790
then you get a live action you can

00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:52,520
delete items well it was supposed to be

00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,980
a nice picture there and none of these

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,660
pics oh my all these other pictures

00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:59,810
don't show up now that's that's that's

00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:01,550
really not very awesome not very awesome

00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:05,900
at all and I can tell you where they are

00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:08,089
at home mobile out loud I put them on my

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:11,780
local Drive see that's why you need out

00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:13,670
loud okay I'm sorry so I have these

00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,410
really nice screenshot showing how I

00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,720
have set it up with Google Drive and

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:23,270
Dropbox that I can't show you now I'm

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:25,460
sorry mayor Koopa it's it's a little

00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:28,430
more complicated to set up Google Drive

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,829
axes and Dropbox because well these

00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,560
companies make a little bit difficult to

00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:36,589
X to use external applications to access

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,780
their data well you kind of get probably

00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:42,020
that their business model is to not do

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:43,970
that so it's a bit of work but there's

00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,829
there are pretty simple clear manuals

00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:48,260
that helped you go through the steps you

00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:51,290
need to create a developer account at

00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:52,970
Google oh yeah and then enable your

00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,800
application and then you get like

00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,970
credentials back and you put them in and

00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,980
then it works again I can even show you

00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:04,609
in my web browser later that it works it

00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,950
really does it's just a bit of work and

00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:09,109
then you can turn on encryption and I

00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:11,540
mean that's also really simple again you

00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:13,280
go to the app you click on enable and

00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:15,410
then you go to the admin section and

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,630
there you just turn on encryption you

00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:23,300
can give a recovery password so the

00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:25,190
encryption is quite smart yeah sorry so

00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,770
it creeps all the file encrypts all your

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,800
files in the storage but the credentials

00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:34,250
are put on the server so the key here is

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,380
you need to trust the server at your own

00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:40,460
uncloudy surf now obviously if you run

00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:45,470
it at home or at a provider you really

00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:47,180
trust and that is okay and then it

00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:49,700
encrypts all the files on all the

00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,920
storage systems so the thing this does

00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,230
is it doesn't protect you from a server

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,339
that's evil but it protects you from

00:39:54,230 --> 00:40:00,829
external data storage is that are not

00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:04,040
trustworthy so this is how you can use a

00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:07,220
box or Google Drive or Dropbox to store

00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,930
your data and crypt it because then if

00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,990
you access the file from your mobile

00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:14,869
phone it asks your own cloud server that

00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:17,569
you trust for the file yo cut server has

00:40:14,869 --> 00:40:19,369
the encryption key and then it asked the

00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:21,710
on cloud server then gets the encrypted

00:40:19,369 --> 00:40:24,050
file from google google has no idea

00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,480
about what's in the file but it gives

00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,460
the file if it does its job and then on

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,130
the local server your own cloud server

00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:33,619
it's decrypted with the key and then

00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,630
sent to your encrypted of coffee as hell

00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:37,760
right with you set up its then sent to

00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:40,099
your mobile phone or to your desktop or

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,220
your laptop or wherever you want it so

00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:45,800
it's safe for the external storage it

00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:47,990
doesn't and well it kind of protects you

00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,359
halfway if somebody is just looking at

00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:51,790
your data storage from one cloud but if

00:40:50,359 --> 00:40:54,349
they can see your whole on clouds

00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:56,690
installation then they also have access

00:40:54,349 --> 00:40:59,030
to the encryption key so this doesn't

00:40:56,690 --> 00:41:01,700
protect you completely and keep that in

00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:04,040
mind when you're using it you still need

00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:06,290
to trust your server there needs to be a

00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,480
point of trust somewhere right and we

00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:10,040
don't encrypt files on the client and

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,770
send them entirely encrypted to your

00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:18,800
server your server you need to own for

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:20,450
this to work properly so in the apps few

00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
well you should have been seen the

00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:24,440
absolute the whole time but you know

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,710
screenshots missing so let's go back

00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:30,020
here on the left side apps and then you

00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:33,319
can add apps my head did have that right

00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,450
yes I did yeah so here are the apps on

00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:37,910
the top with the light gray background

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,589
you see the ones that are enabled below

00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:45,049
that the ones that you can enable that

00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:47,329
are included these ones are included and

00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:49,369
as part of on clouds and these are third

00:41:47,329 --> 00:41:51,619
party I know you can't read that but you

00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:52,549
know third party it says they're at

00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:55,069
third party

00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:57,679
means that they are developed by well

00:41:55,069 --> 00:42:00,109
you know not random people but people

00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,059
from the uncut community and they are on

00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:04,099
absolute unclouded org and when you

00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:06,559
click on them and then click on enable

00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:09,199
they're automatically downloaded from

00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,630
App Store don't crowd org and then

00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:15,170
install on your server now you say well

00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:19,009
that's pretty scary well these apps the

00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:21,380
ones that are show up here they are they

00:42:19,009 --> 00:42:23,539
have gone through a verifying process by

00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,249
the uncloudy community so they should be

00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:27,170
safe otherwise it wouldn't have put them

00:42:25,249 --> 00:42:28,819
there right there not included with

00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:32,420
wrong clouds they're not a hundred

00:42:28,819 --> 00:42:33,799
percent you know and yeah at some point

00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:36,650
you need to trust the community on this

00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:39,829
as well I suppose there are more apps

00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:42,079
available a lot more actually but those

00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:43,999
have not gone through a really extensive

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:46,219
vetting process like the ones that are

00:42:43,999 --> 00:42:47,809
included here so when you go to absolute

00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:50,869
unclouded or you will find a lot more

00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:53,989
and we haven't made installation of

00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:55,279
those too easy because well the security

00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:59,059
reason we don't want to make it too easy

00:42:55,279 --> 00:43:00,920
too well do well scary but actually

00:42:59,059 --> 00:43:03,619
scary things so these you will have to

00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:05,299
download extract and then put in a magic

00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:06,949
folder and then I'll try to pick them up

00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:09,979
and then you know you can enable them I

00:43:06,949 --> 00:43:11,509
mean so terribly hard but it's a little

00:43:09,979 --> 00:43:12,769
more work than just clicking on the

00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:15,199
navel and then it downloads and installs

00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:19,209
them right which i think is a good

00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:26,150
balance between safety and convenience

00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:28,519
now let me go back here so again the fat

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:30,349
ones are nicely integrated automatically

00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:33,339
downloaded but the gnome checked ones

00:43:30,349 --> 00:43:36,439
are an app still done cloud the dork so

00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:40,249
and I want to move to things that are a

00:43:36,439 --> 00:43:42,890
bit less nice yeah in my opinion I mean

00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:44,449
this this personally blocked me for

00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,189
quite a while I know as I said very

00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:48,199
little about surfer technology i have

00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:49,729
been community manager for opensuse so I

00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:52,069
know a little bit about the solutions

00:43:49,729 --> 00:43:54,199
before that have been linux user for 10

00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:56,059
years so I know the command line and all

00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:57,650
that stuff doesn't scare me but I've

00:43:56,059 --> 00:43:59,890
never really played with servers with

00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:03,199
networking I know nothing about security

00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:04,450
almost nothing firewalls are things are

00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,849
just disabled on my desk

00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:08,470
so because that just doesn't work it

00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:10,540
block stuff that I don't want to be

00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:14,320
blocked and you know I'm not terribly

00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:16,240
smart with that stuff but well for

00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:18,099
uncloudy to be really useful you need to

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,140
do more than half as a cell running

00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:22,450
because when i'm home on my internal

00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:25,000
network i can access own clouds and

00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:27,130
setting it up as you've seen is zipper

00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,099
in own cloud and starting apache and

00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:32,020
it'll work that's super easy and then in

00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:33,609
your house you might want ssl encryption

00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,670
but the thing is of course i'm now not

00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:39,010
home i'm here and my own cloud client

00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:40,990
still needs to sync with my system at

00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,450
home that's where it gets complicated

00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:46,270
because the bloody routers everybody has

00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:48,250
at home those things are firewalls they

00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:50,740
block outside and inside in going

00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,960
connections or not outgoing but he

00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:55,060
blocks the income connections so my

00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:57,849
laptop cannot connect to my system at

00:44:55,060 --> 00:45:00,130
home without me opening a port in my

00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:03,040
firewall and that's pretty nasty

00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:05,680
business and not just that it don't just

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,839
have to open a port in the firewall here

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:11,050
are the steps basically the thing is

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,210
your IP address I don't know how it is a

00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:16,119
few guys and girls but I have an IP

00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:19,030
address it changes every now and then

00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,220
you know dynamic IP so that means I

00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,839
can't just write down my IP address and

00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,119
enter it in my own cloud client here

00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:27,010
after I've opened the firewall and then

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,140
it will sync my files do my server at

00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,300
home and it doesn't work there's my IP

00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:33,910
address changes how do I know the new IP

00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:37,569
address and this is pretty nasty stuff

00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:39,730
because the thing is now I mean a lot of

00:45:37,569 --> 00:45:42,520
complicated things you can simplify but

00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:44,980
this for us owncloud people is really

00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,470
hard to solve because every router is

00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,270
different and we're working on this and

00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:52,210
we're trying to look for solutions but

00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:55,540
they're not nice at the moment it seems

00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:57,400
like the only solutions are well some

00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:01,089
routers you can poke a hole in the

00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:04,420
firewall with APL wats the name ap and

00:46:01,089 --> 00:46:06,220
BUP and be thank you and so that there

00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:09,220
are some protocols that help you and at

00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:12,069
work with some but not all routers yeah

00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,050
that's nice but not all part is very

00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:16,569
annoying of course and then the

00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,640
alternative if it doesn't work on your

00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:20,519
router

00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,279
that we say look up the manual of your

00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:24,660
router now that kind of works for me

00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:28,200
because I was willing to put in time

00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:29,760
it's also my job right but that's all

00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,099
going to work for my parents that's for

00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,079
sure and it's not going to work for the

00:46:32,099 --> 00:46:36,839
majority of people I mean if they have

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,519
to look up the manual of their router to

00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:41,099
find out how to open the port and a

00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:42,660
firewall for own clouds I mean

00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:45,150
explaining all the firewall as is

00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,769
probably already too much so this digit

00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,240
nasty this is just a problem and

00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:50,579
honestly I don't know how to solve it

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,859
that there are some ways around it like

00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:54,720
you know going via proxy but that means

00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:57,269
you have to route all your data to a

00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:59,250
third party well you can do that

00:46:57,269 --> 00:47:01,470
encrypted but still the third party

00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,819
needs to have all that data right at

00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,599
throon they're not going to do that for

00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:08,430
free so proxies cost money that's not

00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:10,650
cool yeah we can build it in that you

00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,930
can sign up from the unclass UI for a

00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,809
proxy but then we're gonna have to ask

00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:17,760
people to pay five bucks a month just to

00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:21,299
be able to get to the files from outside

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:22,829
of the firewall I mean come on you don't

00:47:21,299 --> 00:47:24,990
even need to pay that much for Google

00:47:22,829 --> 00:47:28,349
Drive right this this is a barrier this

00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:30,829
is a problem and seriously any any ideas

00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:33,690
any suggestions on how to solve this is

00:47:30,829 --> 00:47:35,460
really extremely welcome because this is

00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:38,880
the kind of stuff we need to solve if on

00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:41,849
clouds is to go you know really global

00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,009
right for for Bernal home people I

00:47:41,849 --> 00:47:46,289
personally think it should be something

00:47:44,009 --> 00:47:47,970
you can really run at home add the

00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:50,309
freedom box some of you might know this

00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:52,950
this is like these little books that's

00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:55,589
basically a Raspberry Pi ish thing in it

00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:57,329
and you just plug it in your power plug

00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:59,849
at home and you plug in a network port

00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:02,309
and then it offers all kinds of services

00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:04,950
that has uncloudy support you can run on

00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:06,839
cloud on that thing but it has the same

00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:08,849
problem if you can't reach your freedom

00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:11,789
box outside of your local network it

00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:15,059
doesn't really do much you know it's

00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:18,299
yeah so this this is not cool there are

00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:21,509
tools I mean I basically well I have my

00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:23,160
yo sport recom domain and thanks to his

00:48:21,509 --> 00:48:25,890
help from a colleague and I couldn't do

00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:27,450
this alone honestly I was helped from a

00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:31,230
colleague I could hook it up to my

00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:33,510
router and then I used free dns

00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,670
freight the dork which solves the

00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:40,590
problem of your dynamically changing IP

00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:42,869
address so this is doable right it's

00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:45,450
doable you need to know a little bit and

00:48:42,869 --> 00:48:48,300
honestly this was the simple part go

00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:50,730
harder after that because yeah you need

00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,170
to also configure a server to do all

00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:55,070
this right you need to have a cron job

00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,630
that frequently update your IP address

00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:59,220
it's possible still for my laptop to

00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:01,650
lose connection with my own trial at

00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:04,710
home for up to half an hour I can live

00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:07,680
of that usually so as long as not

00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:09,210
watching a movie well there's all

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:12,990
certificates and all that stuff needs to

00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:14,910
be set up yeah and as I said you know

00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:17,100
this dis this part was really screwed up

00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:19,500
I mean I had already played with my

00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:22,560
router once or twice oh I kind of could

00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:25,109
do this quite easily actually but this

00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:27,030
this is something it's different on

00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:28,740
every brand of router and everybody has

00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:35,700
different router so this is just screwed

00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:40,260
up basically yeah as I said upnp is a

00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:42,450
potential solution but otherwise we need

00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:46,380
to do to look for other solutions

00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:49,830
basically here and this is not what I

00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:51,270
thought it would be so basically the

00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:53,730
main part of the presentation is over

00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:55,560
which is good because having tone for 50

00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:58,260
minutes and some of you might have

00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,240
questions I now have a bunch of slides

00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:02,190
on other technologies that we have an

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:07,230
uncloudy that are supported that are

00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:10,380
more have you say not friendly and some

00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:11,880
details on how to get involved but this

00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,230
is also the time when you need to start

00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:19,280
out some questions if you have them

00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:22,490
please please so on clouds yeah should

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:28,050
I'll repeat your questions you say it

00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:34,980
the comments oh I know but I can repeat

00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:37,500
it ok ok you can have mine think I came

00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,050
a little bit late but I just heard your

00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,690
troubles it's getting too connected to

00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:44,300
your own clown so I have a little

00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:46,430
suggestion that

00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:51,710
the solution to all your problems is

00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:54,860
getting ipv6 so back your provider but

00:50:51,710 --> 00:50:58,430
people around you try to explain them

00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:03,710
that ipv6 is cool and they could really

00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:06,890
move to the 21st century and yeah get

00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:10,850
ipv6 and you will get fixed IP IP

00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:15,280
address you will get plenty of them you

00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:20,030
can set up static stuff and there's even

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,100
specification for mobile ipv6 so ipv6

00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:25,040
Souls actually indeed the firewall

00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:29,570
problem but yeah the world has been

00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:33,110
moving slowly towards 2010 there's also

00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:36,860
other solution if your provider is for

00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:39,020
this low get ipv6 tunnel that is easily

00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:42,590
configurable and you will get the same

00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:45,590
stuff without your provider does it not

00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:49,310
have to do all the data over the tunnel

00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:51,380
all the time yeah but usually these

00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:57,290
tunnels are nowadays not that slow

00:51:51,380 --> 00:52:00,410
anymore so it's probably usable and if

00:51:57,290 --> 00:52:02,600
you are traveling your hotel connection

00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,120
would be slower than the tunnel so it

00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,370
doesn't matter it or not are the free

00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:13,940
yeah ok this sounds like the solution

00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:16,790
can you hack PHP I prefer not to fair

00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:18,970
enough fair enough but came to few

00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,970
things

00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:28,240
next question I'll happily keep talking

00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:29,770
about stuff but again 10 minutes and so

00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,060
if you have asked if you have questions

00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:33,060
to ask you should really ask them now

00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:47,020
all right so one of the things behalf

00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:49,210
one is that well you said the PHP thing

00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:50,320
would have your problem because it will

00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,910
actually be good because you know you

00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,430
can get PHP everywhere for a couple of

00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:56,200
euros a month for box whatever in that

00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,540
case though most of the installations

00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:01,240
I've seen are pretty much in secure

00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:03,280
against pretty much everything I mean

00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:07,510
they set up these cheap providers have

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:09,670
is actually more more of a harm than a

00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:12,130
solution to your privacy needs for that

00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:14,740
matter because they're securing PHP is

00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:16,930
pretty much of a hard job with current

00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,460
infrastructure it's only to fall 2014 we

00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:22,980
have still a long way to go to actually

00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:26,020
well they patchy serve PHP security

00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:30,580
there was some blunting and to add to

00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:35,260
that I've just looked it up in 2014 and

00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:38,020
we on week 17 in 2014 now I think and on

00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:40,120
the website of on the onload website

00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:43,990
there's 14 security advisories so far

00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:47,770
for this year and the class of bugs is

00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:51,390
really well how to put it it's like

00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:54,520
simple things simple beginner type of

00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:56,710
problem things like you would not do if

00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:58,180
you were an experienced PHP code problem

00:53:56,710 --> 00:54:00,550
is many PHP quarters are not experienced

00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:03,100
so this is her you get loads of that

00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:05,140
depth when you take the tree anyway that

00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:08,800
was certainly hoping the other thing is

00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:10,480
I can i address that show I mean I I

00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,460
know that this is an issue we know this

00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:15,370
is an issue we're actually about to hire

00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:18,670
a full-time security person on the team

00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:20,590
who was one well we have 20 coders if

00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,420
one of the main security if let me put

00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:24,220
it this way if every company had one out

00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,530
of 20 to be purely full-time security

00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,530
and I think our security situation would

00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:31,720
be better in the world wouldn't it I

00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:33,260
don't think that's a bad ratio but fair

00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:36,980
enough yes one

00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:38,360
and obviously we do expect and hope that

00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,450
that person will also help train the

00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:44,930
others to be you know better at these

00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:48,290
things yeah I mean your rights we're

00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:49,790
cleaning up this I mean that's also why

00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:51,140
there are security advisories there

00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:52,970
because we're cleaning it up now and

00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:55,130
that's still a lot of work and we still

00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:57,650
have a lot to do I mean it's only three

00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:59,630
and a half year old projects at four

00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:01,760
years I think now yeah it's four years

00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,280
old and the first two years were

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:09,440
basically you know a lot of students

00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:10,910
mostly working on it so yeah we still

00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,360
have a lot of work to clean it up and

00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:18,350
get it to a level of more secure and

00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:21,380
professional the own cloud enterprise

00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:25,010
edition does have a little plus in this

00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:27,830
regard because it's actually well just

00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,930
like the way Souza dursley a very much

00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:31,400
limited set of packages and the same

00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:33,290
goes for the uncle enterprise edition

00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,660
it's much more limited set of packages

00:55:33,290 --> 00:55:38,630
which has gone through several security

00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:40,430
audits over the years already and I

00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:41,960
still wouldn't say there aren't any

00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:44,210
mistakes in there or even beginner

00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,010
mistakes because again we have a legacy

00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,870
that we're working on but this is

00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:50,240
definitely on the radar very much as a

00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,340
high priority were working on it and I

00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,790
mean I'm sure you prefer to have you

00:55:52,340 --> 00:55:57,800
know the security bug that we found open

00:55:55,790 --> 00:56:01,310
on our website as opposed to you know

00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,870
never hearing about them right sure so

00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:04,550
the other thing you just you've just

00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:09,740
mentioned that again the Enterprise

00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:14,030
Edition which is um well not a GPL

00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:16,160
license you mentioned right yes and so

00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:18,770
it doesn't ship all the apps you've also

00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,010
said that yes all right it's a limited

00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:23,990
set of apps a very limited said actually

00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:26,600
the idea is obviously dead only the ones

00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:31,490
that we can support and check etc etc

00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:33,980
are shipped right so then I would need

00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:36,500
to sign a contributors license agreement

00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:40,720
for for the core only for the course why

00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:43,290
not go the apps yes not perhaps I

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,120
believe their licenses next

00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:47,550
in for the apps but I'm not really clear

00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:49,260
how that is done or to be honest I would

00:56:47,550 --> 00:56:51,900
need to look that up but I believe that

00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:54,900
it's done that way with an exception so

00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:57,930
the apps are fully a GPL and just like

00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:01,890
that but the core is what do a license

00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:04,470
essentially yeah but again I mean that's

00:57:01,890 --> 00:57:11,550
why we pay the 20 25 guys to work on it

00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:12,840
dries right any other questions I can't

00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:18,900
show you the rest of the slides my

00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:20,280
laptops out of power sorry and that's

00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,540
too bad because there were stuff about

00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,340
how to contribute but then again

00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:31,560
unclouded or work i'm sure you can find

00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:34,220
it and yeah questionnaire hello is there

00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,990
a source code for client applications

00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:41,070
the desktop client the assets on get

00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:46,020
habits fully open the android app is

00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:48,270
also fully open GPL i think the iOS one

00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:51,750
you know how much Apple loves GPL

00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:55,740
software so that's not cheap yeah but no

00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:58,350
source code on it might be under the bsd

00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:01,080
or MIT ich license i'm not sure honestly

00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:02,910
i know that there are libraries for all

00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:04,920
the platforms that you can use to write

00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:09,630
client applications and they are bsd

00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:11,970
style but i don't know exactly what

00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:15,180
licenses of the iOS app it might simply

00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:18,030
be closed because we have to it's yeah

00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:20,060
limitation of the iOS store okay thank

00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,060
you

00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:30,190
any more questions well that seems to be

00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:32,430
at done thank you very much for

00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:32,430
