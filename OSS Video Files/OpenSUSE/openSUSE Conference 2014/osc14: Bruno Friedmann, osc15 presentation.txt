unfortunately we only get one but this

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,000
one was a bit too far in west side so as

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:09,869
a board refused to follow it and we are

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,780

00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:15,840
are able to under the new destination

00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:21,170
and how our new destination will be so

institution so I prepare for you a

00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:04,310
smaller of looking obvious so

still pretty connecting Minds the

00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:28,900
ultimate challenge your next conference

00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:33,659
needs a place that fuels imagination

00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,659
our place that inspires clear thinking

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,900
The Hague it's a vibrant seaside city in

00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:42,909
the Netherlands bursting with character

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,189
but a truly international outlook

00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:52,569
offering both historic and cutting-edge

00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:54,819
architecture culture and art combine

00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:57,579
that with miles and miles of sandy

00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:01,420
beaches and a fresh sea breeze that

00:02:57,579 --> 00:03:04,329
clears the mind The Hague has

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,400
conferencing in its DNA the city has

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,400
grown into a world center for peace

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,829
justice and diplomacy more than 80

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,560
Nations and organizations have been

00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:16,569
brought together here in the hague yeah

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,740
is where the world comes to reflect and

00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:22,530
the line its moral compass

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:27,590
The Hague is open to what moves the

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,590
world and that's why the world is here

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:39,450

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,670
delegates connect naturally

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,390
The Hague is a compact convenient City

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,850
with two international airports close by

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:27,220
an ultra-modern network of roads rail

00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,590
and waterways and short distances

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,450
between points of interest the logistics

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:42,690
of conference organization in The Hague

00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:46,630
a problem-free this conference is

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,670
critical to our way forward

00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,660
with your way forward to an exceptional

00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,660
conference on meeting

00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,420
connection

00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,680
inspiration

00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,360
think

00:05:26,719 --> 00:05:39,300
it's not me as I do that we do I think

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:43,110
it presents a place and especially the

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:47,129
good choice to go there it's quite easy

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:53,789
to connect and only discover a bit more

00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:55,800
later so we already has ants to drill a

00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:00,060
beetle around all the conference center

00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:05,009
and try to find a good place for Nico we

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:10,639
are not nuclear sex or any government is

00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:10,639
for a choice I would be omniverse ooh

00:06:13,129 --> 00:06:21,330
universum is a kind of sorry a kind of

00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:23,879
IMAX theater it has a capacity of 3 300

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:29,069
seats and is often used for a different

00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:31,909
event like simple Xia presentation it

00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:35,099
would be has an excellent kick off

00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:37,400
location with option for doing breakout

00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:41,819
session and something like this so

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:45,150
unreal II want to get there Fritz first

00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:48,270
choice for him but ok first choice is

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:52,830
not only if it's not always a he to get

00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:57,870
it so he look around and the second

00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:00,990
place he choose was a museum museum as a

00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:04,740
namesake yes was funded as a museum for

00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:07,909
education I'm sorry had not able to

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:12,169
pronounce as a Dutch word for that and

00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:16,009
it asked has a variety of even early

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:21,750
like having several different rooms and

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:24,509
holes together odds remember well as a

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,270
social part of the party of the

00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:31,300
conference last year in t sonic so is

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:35,389
quite attached to get some social

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:40,729
place to make it yeah more connecting

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:45,019
people and we also already have backup

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:48,099
place which is Babylon if something goes

00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:51,739
wrong with previous place it has all

00:07:48,099 --> 00:07:55,219
what the board and the community has for

00:07:51,739 --> 00:08:01,189
a conference so so room the place so

00:07:55,219 --> 00:08:07,669
outside for the social okay no just in

00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:10,099
case you don't know hunt is quite known

00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:16,899
happen to remember quite a really active

00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:20,619
in different part of our project and I

00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:25,759
present his backup guy which is Reuben

00:08:20,619 --> 00:08:35,810
and both of them are while training to

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:39,380
prepare event they do it oops sorry they

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:43,069
do it our regulary in Netherland for

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:48,579
making concert or some hack vests for

00:08:43,069 --> 00:08:54,740
thousands of people so we can trust them

00:08:48,579 --> 00:08:58,519
but up for they will not do the whole to

00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:01,970
work together we will have to commit

00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:05,589
ourselves to help them to make you know

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:12,819
our next conference a big success such

00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:16,130
son like an evidence a few more scenes

00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:19,750
as you see in the video travel is really

00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:22,759
really easy to be able to go there it's

00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:27,920
well-connected intention internationally

00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:30,949
by playing you have one airport 15

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:37,310
minutes by taxi the other one shipping

00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:40,269
is 20 minute by train so there is also a

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,410
lot of international train connection

00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:45,690
from all over Europe

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:49,319
you see that from reading with Brazil is

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:55,620
one hour and a half for example and

00:09:49,319 --> 00:10:00,540
there is even trade for UK inside the

00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:05,699
city it is quite easy to work get a taxi

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:12,779
abuse from and if you are in awe Sprave

00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:16,139
you can rent a bike now you see zero

00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,949
tell there is a lot of hotel I think

00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:26,610
here we will check a bit more to get

00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:33,509
good deal doing our best for your future

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:36,779
guests and hunts already send us some

00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:41,850
some idea about the laser and social

00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:45,600
part of the conference so he's looking

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,209
for a bubble tea party perhaps in front

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,910
of the seaside and something like this

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:57,529
so he has a lot of crazy idea to to

00:10:52,910 --> 00:11:02,399
really make something cool next year

00:10:57,529 --> 00:11:06,230
though that's option for us so like at

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:10,860
least now i would like to present you a

00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:15,870
kind of timeline to get there from ya

00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:21,060
today to to hover next conference i will

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:27,120
call it a bday minus two well ok

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:31,040
everything is parked at minus fra for we

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:35,579
should have our program published at

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:44,790
maestro the TSP so gone cold should be

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:48,589
done at minus-5 we should try to get our

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:53,279
conference advertised in paper magazine

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:54,250
at minus-5 the cfp second call is bad

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,590
too

00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:02,200
we'll see who we could have inside our

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:05,890
program minus 6 I would say well ok it's

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:12,310
a keynote speaker unknown and we could

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:17,160
count on them yeah so like a bit crazy

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:23,830
you know more to go i'd say i have minus

00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:31,390
7 her sponsor hunt you know kindly and

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:34,950
friendly held at minus-8 could be nice

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:40,000
to have the first thrown off cold for

00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:43,080
paper- ages are just a bit before the

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,740
perfect time to have our hard-working

00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:57,250
website reading yeah minus nine location

00:12:50,740 --> 00:13:01,450
and the date should be fixing minus a

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:10,390
number is there is missing sense is the

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:14,980
unit we can choose d a bit stressful I

00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:18,760
said weeks mm a bit too sure i would say

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:25,690
we should perhaps plan or try our best

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:28,690
plan that in bounds next year will be

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:32,770
the first time we really have one year

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:36,940
behind us to organize a conference the

00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:40,990
last to have less than one a year well

00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:49,150
even a sonic was gone in seven seven

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:52,600
months oil so ose 15 has his chance to

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:56,640
to get out and to be prepared I don't

00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:02,430
have been a long time since low and yeah

00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:02,430
so G day we should arrive at that who

00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:20,180
are you him are you going to that

00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:24,800
project crazy for sure we have a lot of

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:29,029
things that we want to achieve we really

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:33,640
hope fight and and spend a lot of time

00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,640
and energy energy today to do that

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:45,640
whatever you we we want to achieve we

00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:45,640
will have to stick a bit more cancer and

00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:55,670
try our best like we do we have time but

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:59,480
perhaps time to find another way to do

00:14:55,670 --> 00:15:04,520
things to better up to be a bit more

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:06,980
efficient about how is do since we will

00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,380
have retro feedback about what's

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,890
happened last year what's happened this

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:20,089
year and how's how we would like to draw

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:23,030
the same in the future I would say we

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:27,950
can try something that is quite easy is

00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:33,530
a bit more team and in 13 communication

00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:42,350
I say how the conference need hard work

00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:47,300
news cfp of them website as it's been

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:51,520
there a lot of team and perhaps we could

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:54,170
do better with communicating and

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,380
synchronizing ZF all of the different

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,380
team

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:10,010
so

00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:18,769
let's remember me um some things that

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:23,929
happen this Friday a Canadian guy is

00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:30,279
cool you see you like so fly enter and

00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:30,279
just ask who are you what are you doing

00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:41,809
are you changing the world well sir yes

00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:52,009
you say cool continues up please Iran

00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:55,069
after his girlfriend of such so i will

00:16:52,009 --> 00:17:01,249
stop bugging now free it hugs for

00:16:55,069 --> 00:17:06,350
everybody and i hope we will have a lot

00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:09,789
of people that feel invested in want to

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:13,130
get involved inside so next conference

00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:17,000
we will try to make to get people there

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:23,299
but also community are in charge of his

00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:26,720
home even so would be my conclusion you

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:36,039
can remove the you and you and a qui

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:36,039
because I mean in thanks question

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:56,510
um is there any plan already how long it

00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,390
will be because this was not supposed to

00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:01,730
be five days and I think maybe a lot of

00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:03,620
people are scared by five days because

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,540
it takes them one a week out of their

00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:09,230
normal life they have to take a vacation

00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,720
or will be apart from work so this is

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:16,040
maybe concern for people to come or not

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:18,770
oh so I can answer that so the five days

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,400
was really I guess some miscommunication

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,780
so the idea is to have the same format

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,540
they have the welcome reception on

00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:29,450
Thursday night Friday Saturday and

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,940
Sunday program so it's a four-day really

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:34,460
a four-day event and then you know the

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,140
Monday basically half a day so that

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:38,000
people can get back out so it's

00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,030
basically we we're interested to keep

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,740
this format as much as possible of

00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:45,980
course it depends on the venue whether

00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,500
we can get Friday Saturday Sunday and

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,180
Monday like we did here right so there

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,210
may be a flexibility that it has to

00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:54,650
shift but the format is basically I

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,780
think it works for us with the welcome

00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,340
reception the night before and then four

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,320
days or three and a half days of

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,100
programs so that's the goal to keep it

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,100
to that format

00:19:10,169 --> 00:19:18,029
okay why monday for my part of view we

00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:20,519
didn't succeed before having Monday all

00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:22,679
right i mean we had people around but

00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:25,619
was kind of okay i'm leaving anytime

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:30,419
soon we didn't have many attendees on

00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:33,330
monday so from other perspective it

00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:36,259
feels like okay if my presentations on

00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:40,080
monday it's because nobody cares so I

00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:44,700
think the Monday will certainly look

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:47,039
like this one is I think it should be a

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:53,639
good day for the workshop even if it's

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:57,779
after the even party to get perhaps yes

00:19:53,639 --> 00:20:02,669
more formalized workshop for on Monday

00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:06,239
and toes are many sticker to Friday such

00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:08,549
a Saturday and Sunday so my presentation

00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:12,090
is on monday and i don't feel nobody

00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:15,090
cares so okay the second part is though

00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:16,649
um if you say the conference ends on

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,299
sunday then people will start leaving

00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:20,820
sunday afternoon and then you're just

00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:24,029
making it basically hold a shorter okay

00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,980
so people will always leave um and that

00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:27,600
is general people generally leave on the

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,619
last day of the conference they start

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,109
leaving on the last day of the

00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:32,669
conference even if you say sunday is the

00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:34,980
last day of the conference then you will

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:36,629
see what you see now on monday will

00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,700
happen on sunday and then basically

00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:40,230
we'll only have a two two and a half day

00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,799
event and we don't really want that

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:47,879
because we then have too much content

00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:51,509
for those days so that's why monday is

00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:54,869
there gives us an opportunity to keep

00:20:51,509 --> 00:20:57,259
people really until the end of the day

00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:57,259
on Sunday

00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:08,370
another question remember cuz uh just to

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:11,610
make a small review um monday used to

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:14,730
happen because Susie labs was there so

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,420
they use it the best besides last year

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:21,090
at this year the best was officer slaps

00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:24,710
so they were trapped in our stuffs were

00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:30,140
of them remember what happened in Prague

00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:33,030
bragging Nuremberg gizelle yeah yeah

00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,370
centrifuge yeah yeah so a number we

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,920
already have planned the monday before

00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:41,850
souza labs decided to join the

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:44,430
conference so that's not quite it's not

00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:47,760
monday is not there because suzl apps at

00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,440
once was cold okay actually they decided

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,850
after we already had the plans for

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,190
Nuremberg and the timeline to join in so

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,410
so that so the monday is not there

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,360
because of suzhou labs it's really there

00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:02,430
so that we can make sure that we have a

00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:05,010
conference that where we can fill up

00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:07,680
three days if we take the money away you

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:10,860
will see that people start leaving on

00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:14,130
Sunday afternoon and then basically we

00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:16,620
lose a whole day and you know we we

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,020
generally have plenty of content I mean

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,210
you can see today is pretty full and

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:28,110
tomorrow we have some workshops so

00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:30,260
generally we have we have the content so

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,260
did

00:22:43,169 --> 00:22:47,830
this meeting will happen to our next

00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:50,440
April May maybe you mentioned but I

00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:54,250
missed this part uh yeah I think I

00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:57,850
forget to say normally so it's now a

00:22:54,250 --> 00:23:01,360
ticket rule to have open seas conference

00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:05,559
in spring so in March April May time

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:09,370
frame I think the best prayer is really

00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:12,309
the end of April hounds already check

00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:17,100
with because it so there is some

00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:21,490
recurring even happening in Jake and

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:24,909
mostly it it is we have to avoid the

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:30,820
last week of April because its kind of

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:33,549
even with Ralph's family dinner and so

00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:36,870
just the week before the end of April

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:41,740
which is good because Eastern is quite

00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:44,350
at the beginning of the month so what

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,450
happened as events cultural events and

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:50,669
something Liza's will be before and

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:56,940
after the conference so we should have a

00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:56,940
slow slow it for that thank you

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:07,059
other questions all right thank you

00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,059
