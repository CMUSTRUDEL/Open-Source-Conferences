crash okay are you guys ready for it

00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,840
let's go then um yeah I still have to

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,269
slide up from the conference last year

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,269
because it's just such an awesome you

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:19,080
know slide I really liked it and I

00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:21,000
thought yeah let's keep it okay so i'm

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,510
going to talk about you know presenting

00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,130
giving presentations it's going to be

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,750
very much about doing the slides but

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,689
also about how you present things also

00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,559
the story behind it so how you need to

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,210
get that story together that's where i

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,770
come from or at least that's where my

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,980
grandfather left I thought I'd do a

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,739
little bit about me so I think most of

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:49,379
you now all of you know me very well but

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:52,230
yeah I come from a little rural area in

00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,680
the Netherlands so that's actually the

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:57,180
farm of my grandfather from a long time

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,190
ago I mean it doesn't look like that

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,010
anymore at all because they broke down

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,449
most of it and rebuild it but when I was

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,450
a kid this was kind of what it looks

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,430
like and I will go there and play quite

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,479
awesome if you're like eight or nine I

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:17,280
can tell you yeah and of course great

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,860
food from the garden there so to make an

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,549
awesome presentation you need to take

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:28,470
care of two things the story and the

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:31,320
slides simple like that so the story is

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,000
how you tell what you have to tell right

00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,810
you have a subject if something to

00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,350
explain something how it works or what

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,759
something is introducing something new

00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:46,530
how to do something can be anything

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:49,520
that's the story and the story has three

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:54,409
important parts you have an introduction

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,119
you have the content of your sorry and

00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:59,490
what is important also for the story is

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,409
your presentation the way you you bring

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:08,369
it forward now the introduction how you

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:10,259
start is really important it's the first

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,239
impression and you can't really do that

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:13,100
again right there's only one first

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,870
impression

00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:17,180
so the start of a presentation is

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,700
important that's also why I also play

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,900
suggest to make sure that you practice

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,520
the beginning more than anything else

00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,130
basically the really dumb way of

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,870
practicing that I do which is to just

00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,630
start at the beginning torque until I

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,520
get stuck fix what got stuck or what I

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,230
think needs to be better and then start

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,810
at the beginning again that's actually

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:41,810
fine because usually it's starting up

00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,580
that's hard the rest it'll come she

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,910
don't even practice the last part of it

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,910
you'll probably still be fine yeah so

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:54,190
practice it and then then it'll go

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:56,000
perfect it won't be a problem so

00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:57,680
introduction works a little bit like

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,390
this yeah you first of course introduce

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,940
yourself and you can talk about you know

00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:06,440
the farm of your grandfather or you know

00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:08,860
whatever works there you introduce topic

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,380
you say well I'm going to talk about X

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:17,480
presentations and you give an agenda if

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:20,060
you notice how I didn't giving an agenda

00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,190
it gives people an idea of course of

00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,510
where you are and where you're going now

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:25,880
in this presentation I went a little

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,920
over the top and they even did it this

00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,370
way so you have multiple parts and then

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,730
each of them you know the colors you see

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,040
where I am if you want to go that far

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,720
you can but so important what is

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,720
important is that you tell people how

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,730
long you're going to talk I didn't now

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,780
they need to know 30 minutes 45 minutes

00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:49,520
an hour to well I didn't really because

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,100
I have two hours in this slot although

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,430
15 of those are already gone but I don't

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,550
have and two hours talk i'll be talking

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,350
for about 3540 minutes after that

00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,320
there's time to go over some slides if

00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:04,880
you want to get some actual feedback at

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,590
that point i'll ask to turn that offer

00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:13,850
them I just want to do that with you

00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:15,230
guys then it's also always important to

00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:18,530
tell people if they can ask questions

00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,880
during the talk or not some people are

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,430
totally comfortable with that other

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,919
people are not if you're not that's fine

00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:25,570
people can ask at the end and if you are

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:28,870
that's

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,910
k for example if you I interrupted your

00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,440
talk I didn't know if you had set at the

00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,960
beginning of you wanted questions or not

00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,570
but I think you would prefer not to have

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,000
questions because it was really

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,730
disrupting the flow of your talk right

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,110
that's okay mm I sorry I missed the

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:50,760
first part I didn't know if you were

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:53,200
okay with that yeah the microphone yes

00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:58,630
it was nice of me to turn off your

00:04:53,200 --> 00:05:02,080
microphone yes yeah if you have handouts

00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,180
you should basically tell people at the

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,310
beginning if you give the handouts at

00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,810
the beginning that's fine too you can do

00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,980
it later but at least tell people you

00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,600
have handouts because then they don't

00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,120
have to take notes of everything you say

00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,010
now with some talks people want to take

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,080
notes and well if you have handouts and

00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,080
they don't have to write so tell them

00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:26,440
the tip if you get questions repeat them

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,970
at least because especially if your talk

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,640
is being recorded they probably already

00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,160
caught your camera not the people so

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,410
repeat the question and you can even

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,090
write it down it depends a bit on the

00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,220
setting of course but especially when

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:41,890
it's complicated stuff and you have a

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:44,170
whiteboard use it right down the

00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:46,840
question I mean you show that you're

00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,570
taking it serious but it also you know

00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,700
helps people to all follow what's going

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:58,650
on right it's the subject it's there

00:05:51,700 --> 00:06:02,770
it's feasible simple tip that can help

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,660
so let's move on to the content now this

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,120
is obviously the most important part of

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:10,420
presentation and good content goes a

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,910
long way carrying a bad presenter or a

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:14,830
bad presentation I mean if if you know

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:16,530
what you're talking about if you're

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:19,870
passionate about that if it's important

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:23,440
seriously the other stuff it's it's just

00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,240
window dressing it's not yeah you should

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,980
just give the presentation even if you

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,810
think you're not a good presenter you

00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,710
don't know how to make good slides if

00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,080
you know what you're talking about

00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,680
you're enthusiastic about it you'll be

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,169
fine okay don't worry but obviously also

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,729
for the content that helps do to try and

00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:41,580
struck

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:43,229
treadwell and follow certain process so

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:48,770
what's really important are two parts

00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:51,389
the audience and go yeah I mean in our

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,099
free software world you really need to

00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,229
know how technical the people are that

00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:57,479
you're going to talk to do they know

00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,789
what free software is do they know about

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,189
programming I mean if you're standing in

00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:03,990
front of a room of Colonel hackers you

00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:06,509
can skip certain information that is

00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,879
quite crucial to people who have never

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,680
heard about linux before I mean it's

00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,199
pretty obvious but even within those two

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,879
extremes you still have to tell certain

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,669
things to certain audiences so keep that

00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,050
in mind try to get an idea before you

00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,879
know what audience you're talking about

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,330
and you can ask and you can say look you

00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,719
know and does everybody know X and then

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,159
you know you'll just act on that exactly

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:31,139
you just iterate on that I mean that's

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:33,449
perfectly fine if everybody already

00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,180
knows then it's easy just keep in mind

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,889
that you know people don't really want

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:43,159
to waive the fact that they know nothing

00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:45,899
around so you know if you get no hands

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,699
it doesn't necessarily mean everybody

00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,219
knows it might just be that they don't

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:51,930
really want to admit they don't so be a

00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:55,439
little bit conservative there and tell a

00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,999
little more maybe sometimes on the other

00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:02,039
hand I think it's important to have a

00:07:56,999 --> 00:08:04,499
balance there don't make it too simple

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:07,199
either it depends a bit on what you're

00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:11,069
talking about but in a presentation

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:15,569
earlier now I saw a lot of that that you

00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:18,209
have like a graph and well it's okay to

00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:20,039
conclude to take a conclusion out of a

00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:22,020
graph but if the graph is obvious enough

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:24,330
if you do a good job then it should be

00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:27,569
obvious enough then you don't need to go

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,550
and explain the graph any further it's

00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:31,830
fine to take a conclusion as I look you

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,800
know clearly these three guys are the

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,360
most active or you know this team seems

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,760
more active than the other team and the

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,349
more spread-out work though doesn't find

00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,409
conclusions the fact that the graph

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:45,180
shows it you don't need to repeat the

00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,470
North graph says you know just take the

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,209
conclusion let people look for

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,250
themselves whether the graph supports

00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:51,779
your conclusion I mean there's also

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,560
helps keeping your audience a little bit

00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,600
awake

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,290
you know don't make it too simple

00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,940
because at that point now I mean this is

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:02,190
in general and we get to the to the

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,540
slides I will also say that you don't

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,190
need to put everything in the slides

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,470
either because at that point why are you

00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,779
there thats related to this if you say

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:14,400
everything on the slides why did you

00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:17,370
have slides don't bother with it yeah so

00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,260
the goal going back there is of course

00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:20,970
the most important thing that you need

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,580
to take care of now you need to have a

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,430
very good idea of what you want people

00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,800
to know they need to realize here that

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,570
people often get very little from a

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,790
presentation you'd be surprised how

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,560
little really sticks with them it's

00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:37,410
usually only a couple of things two

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,089
three maybe four if you're lucky and

00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:42,420
they were listening really really well

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:44,910
and all high on caffeine you know we

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,110
usually they'll remember much less and

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:47,880
that's of course a bit of a problem

00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,550
because that means if you have one of

00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,210
these presentations with you know 30

00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:56,820
slides each with 20 bullet points well

00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,470
you don't really control what people

00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,820
will remember at that point you have no

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,320
idea what they were a member of your

00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:04,110
slide maybe everybody in the room will

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,940
remember something else now that doesn't

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,980
really help so you need to think before

00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,190
what are the two of three things I want

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,570
people to remember you can even maybe do

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,400
a per section you know that you have a

00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,520
couple of main sexay okay they need to

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,050
remember this about the story and this

00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,880
about the slides like in this case

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,050
doesn't work for all presentations of

00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,390
course if you give a technical

00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:30,060
presentation on how to install an

00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:32,460
application or build the packets well

00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm sorry you come explain that in three

00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,780
steps it's just more complicated than

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,850
that okay so of course it's okay to have

00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,860
more information at that point but then

00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,510
at least make sure that at that point

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,700
they can actually use the slides to

00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,290
easily look it up later because don't

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,660
expect them to remember all the details

00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,970
they'll forget them make sure that

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,350
documented somewhere know your slides

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:54,350
are not documentation

00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:03,280
and of course in any case you know don't

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:05,380
be too ambitious it's better to teach

00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,540
people five things properly than 20

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,490
things well not at all because that's

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,540
what it is in the end that's how it

00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:18,610
works unfortunately now you need to

00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:20,710
guide your audience a little bit maybe

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,120
imagine them to be monkeys but don't be

00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,650
a monkey yourself you know you need to

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:26,110
have a story you have need to have

00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:29,050
something that goes from A to B it has a

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,940
conclusion and I have the problem

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,650
sometimes I go talking into a random

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,470
direction and suddenly discover i have

00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:38,110
no conclusion try to prevent that from

00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:42,040
happening to yourself and try to have a

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:44,080
good story that that goes somewhere and

00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,640
then remove the rest as much as you can

00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,410
just keep 11 tear story and often you

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,080
know you have a tendency to tell all

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,480
kinds of irrelevant side things which is

00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,660
kind of cool they're interesting maybe

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,490
anecdotes but it doesn't really help in

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,690
the end it did I mean after all they're

00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,820
only going to remember two or three

00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,160
things right are they gonna remember

00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,810
that funny anecdote you told well then

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,460
you probably failed because you wanted

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,620
them to remember the three points in

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:16,690
your presentation not the funny story

00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:18,580
sites so minimalism is pretty good and a

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,170
pretty simple and clear structure helps

00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,550
a lot too that's why I of course my

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,840
slides have a very clear and simple

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:28,690
structure yeah I mean two main things

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,430
each with a couple of sub items each of

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,680
a couple of items may be in that but

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:40,010
don't make the tree 2d Peter just keep

00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:43,010
it short and simple now

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,170
that's the story that's a content let's

00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:47,660
talk about the presentation let's talk

00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:51,410
about you standing in front of a bunch

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:53,560
of people me in this case now you

00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,870
probably know the standard rules okay

00:12:53,560 --> 00:13:02,810
practice they say it takes about ten

00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:05,180
thousand hours of practice nearly 10,000

00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,940
hours of practice to become a master in

00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:09,740
something to become really really good

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:12,470
at something and that goes for

00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,740
programming that goes for driving very

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:17,720
fast you know it goes for a lot of

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,310
things at 10,000 hours is something you

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,820
might not have to prepare your

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,350
presentation but of course it's more

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,240
about all presentations than an

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:29,330
individual one that really practices

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,030
everything so you have to accept the

00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:35,660
fact that if you give very rarely a talk

00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:39,230
that you have to practice a lot more to

00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,210
compensate for that at home okay in

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,890
front of a mirror maybe or just in front

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:46,010
of your computer screen stand up and

00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:48,890
talk do your presentation and again and

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,380
again and even record it look at it I

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:54,320
know everybody hates the wrong voice but

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:58,640
it does help right it does give you some

00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,710
tips obviously you have to talk clear

00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,870
you know don't mumble don't talk too

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:04,880
soft try to look around in the room I

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:08,450
mean you know all these things it's just

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,340
that you don't do it right I know their

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:13,850
hearts they're there they really aren't

00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:15,860
that that's simple it often helps me I'm

00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:17,500
I really do this wavy thing you know

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,180
which is very annoying if you have a

00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,760
unbalanced room everybody sitting on the

00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,080
left like here you know then I feel a

00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,140
little awkward looking at the empty

00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,240
chairs back there but still I keep doing

00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,520
it because it's just the mouse you know

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,680
convenient thing to do just hop from the

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,630
different people in the room if it helps

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,060
you you can also focus on someone talk

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:39,710
to a specific person you know they might

00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,440
feel really awkward afterwards but

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:43,880
mostly they want out this so that's cool

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:49,520
and you can't see from the distance who

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:52,070
you're looking at anyway right and yeah

00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,750
also have the slightly less obvious

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:55,670
things you know don't throw

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,560
okay turns around unless you know that

00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,960
the audience knows them you might have

00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,210
to check do you guys know what X Cassidy

00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,830
is you know how awesome the comics are

00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:06,620
okay then I don't have to talk about it

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,480
easy enough what you do you have to

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:12,980
explain that easy to explain their

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,460
awesome look them up if you have a slide

00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:19,700
with a comic on it or a picture with a

00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:21,830
specially slight of a lot of text just

00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:25,010
shut up for a couple of seconds at the

00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,470
beginning show the slides give people a

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:31,160
little while to read it and then start

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:34,430
talking because people can't both listen

00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,040
to you and read might not be a surprise

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,810
but it means you need to take it into

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,520
account people can't do two things at

00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:45,650
once so give a little break given time

00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:50,620
to read and the next point or whatever

00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,620
happens could you maybe turn that off

00:15:50,680 --> 00:16:00,230
Thanks yeah how do you stand now I'm a

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,470
you know nervous person I walk around I

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,830
like it that way don't make that too

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,870
much is then you know people are like

00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:11,570
the whole time that doesn't work I try

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:14,570
to restrict myself to a not too big area

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:19,850
but I like to walk other people stand

00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:21,530
still that's fine too but now handsome

00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,780
pockets and that's that's a hard rule

00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:26,630
isn't it so try to avoid that it's

00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,450
difficult I have a bottle here that

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,980
helps me other people use a pen and of

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,510
course a microphone is absolutely

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,180
awesome for that deal right you always

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:37,280
have a microphone a we handle summer

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:42,080
when it gets painful you can switch

00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:44,210
hands and wave the other around a bit ya

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,890
know hanging on a piece of furniture you

00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:48,530
might have noticed me doing that just

00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:50,360
now it's also hard to not do that it's

00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,790
it's okay to do it a bit but if you do

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:57,380
the same thing the whole time it gets a

00:16:52,790 --> 00:17:01,520
little weird and so don't and you can

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:03,260
have your hands full let's keep

00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,380
something your hand that's for me that's

00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:11,240
the best thing that's for sure

00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,770
now I already told you the tip to look

00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,209
at somebody in the audience and talk to

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:19,190
them so that can help but really looking

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:21,050
at people is important it shows you take

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,610
your audience serious okay so there's

00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:27,980
this really is an important thing to do

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:30,440
okay now there was I've now talked about

00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:32,630
the story and about how you present it

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,570
yeah how you need to stand and sing and

00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:39,260
talk so next object other slides

00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,380
themselves yeah now the important thing

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:46,070
about slides is that they're supportive

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:49,100
that they're simple and if possible they

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:51,830
depend on the subject with visual where

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,140
it's usually better you see my slides

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:57,050
have little text in them and then there

00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:59,510
are slides with no text at all that

00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:01,310
means you have well not too much to

00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,500
focus on on the screen so you can look

00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:06,410
at me and listen to me and that's the

00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:11,720
key here this this is what you're trying

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:14,780
to avoid yeah everybody must have seen

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,280
the horrible horrible slides that have

00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:18,860
been created over the last year's

00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:23,020
especially in the 90s and PowerPoint

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:26,090
came to power horrible really horrible

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:31,340
and these could take out entire

00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:34,000
audiences so avoid them the goal of

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,640
slides is that they're supportive

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,660
they're their support you ideally you

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,630
should be able to give your presentation

00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:44,270
without any slides at all the audience

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:46,970
should only be able to follow you easier

00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:49,400
with the slide not harder because then

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,580
your slides are bad yeah it shouldn't be

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,800
too destructive you can be there without

00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:58,420
slides slides cannot be there without

00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,920
you if your slides make you obsolete

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,510
there's way too much information on them

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,400
why are you talking get to the side of

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,530
the room and just click through them

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,950
then if you put so much tax on them yeah

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:13,490
you don't need to make full sentences

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:17,020
words words do the trick supportive

00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,020
again don't go too deep

00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:24,950
again I personally believe if you can

00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:26,779
share the slides for someone and then

00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,480
they know everything you were trying to

00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:33,379
tell in the presentation you make really

00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:36,230
bad slides what I actually do myself as

00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:37,730
I put all I say in the notes section so

00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,489
you can actually learn everything from

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,440
my slides that I'm saying except that it

00:19:40,489 --> 00:19:44,509
won't be on the slides because then it's

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,509
just distracting this is a simple tip

00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:50,840
most presentation applications allow you

00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:53,239
to have notes section use it just type

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,090
there your story even in full sentences

00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:57,950
or just in bullet points but put their

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,690
all that extra information don't put it

00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:05,899
on the slides the slides are just

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:08,480
guiding nothing else consistency in

00:20:05,899 --> 00:20:10,489
slides is important too if you have

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,739
noticed my presentation is basically

00:20:10,489 --> 00:20:16,580
slight picture slide picture slide

00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:17,989
picture it's just nice cannons people

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,950
can expect something and you already

00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:27,009
guess what the next slide will be it's

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:30,230
going to be awesome this is bill and

00:20:27,009 --> 00:20:34,399
Bill slides are not very supportive of

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:37,809
bill bill slides are replacing bill bill

00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:41,330
is just a detail with the slides for

00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:44,059
somebody making so much money this is a

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:51,070
terrible way of presenting yourself and

00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:53,600
I'm sorry yes he's not very good at head

00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:56,509
I'm not even talking about the colors

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,629
and the phones yeah just the number of

00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:05,149
bullets on these slides make mr. gates

00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:07,700
entirely obsolete and that sets because

00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:13,609
after all he did build quite an Imperium

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:16,609
like it or not this guy is Steve his

00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:19,340
slides are supportive of Steve they

00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:21,289
don't replace him at all actually

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:23,509
without slides that would still be a

00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,100
wonderful presentation I mean you

00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,440
quickly look at the slides and they go

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:29,960
back to Steve because you see in a

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,970
glance what the slide has to say it

00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,369
doesn't mean the slide doesn't do what

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:36,619
it's supposed to do it says there's an

00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:39,109
eight gigabytes something out there

00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:41,509
which is very pretty and shiny and you

00:21:39,109 --> 00:21:43,340
want it and you better listen very well

00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:48,080
to Steve because he's explaining why you

00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:52,129
want it yeah that's how you do it I'm

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,919
not saying it's always easy but this is

00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:57,259
a very helpful way of doing it so a

00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,249
simple way is to just do a big picture

00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:05,389
or a few points per slide and use a big

00:22:01,249 --> 00:22:07,909
fault what is very little of it and you

00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:09,529
guys aren't and girls are getting the

00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,389
point here with the little amount of

00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:13,369
text I half right you don't need more

00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:15,859
bullet point and it's better to have

00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:17,690
more slides with less content on them

00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:18,710
than less slides with more content I

00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,330
mean it could have made this

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,330
presentation with the same amount of

00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:26,659
texts on 10 slides or five probably even

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:30,799
less now but instead I used well quite a

00:22:26,659 --> 00:22:34,220
lot so of course if you have facts to

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,279
share share them but share them as

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,830
minimal as possible in a few words not

00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,509
with whole sentences don't know as soon

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:44,029
as you need to look at grammar and Inter

00:22:41,509 --> 00:22:45,889
Punk shin you're doing it wrong okay

00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,779
that grammar and independence you do not

00:22:45,889 --> 00:22:52,279
belong on slides words belong on slides

00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:54,409
but just bear words and if you really

00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,470
have a lot of details that's what

00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:59,869
handouts are for really print something

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,389
give it out to people and say look the

00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:04,279
details they're there or give him a wiki

00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:08,450
page or something else where you can put

00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:10,489
all the details that's fine yeah I mean

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:12,409
if you have a lot of text a lot of

00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:14,299
people feel the need to be complete put

00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:16,639
everything on the slide the only result

00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:21,889
is that you will get ignored and that's

00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:24,019
said it's not to go this this is not

00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:26,690
simple this is not getting a point

00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:28,669
across i mean do you get a point i don't

00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,070
because there are so many points being

00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:34,129
made here it is just a bloody bloody

00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,710
mess and don't even think about doing it

00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:39,019
this way I mean a diagram is nice the

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:40,980
idea of a picture yeah it's a good idea

00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:45,419
but execution

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:48,000
no no as we all know Steve is much

00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,820
better at this yeah Steve gets it not

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,370
too much text and what is there is it's

00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,380
all repetitive I mean yeah this has a

00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:57,120
lot of you know pictures on that tool

00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:59,549
but when you think about it it's one

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,820
point that he's making he's not making

00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:05,220
20 confusing points is making one point

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:07,770
there's a cadence and this is how it's

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,900
going it's very simple it's very clear

00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,510
and that's exactly how a slight should

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:18,630
be because people get a point and then

00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:20,130
go back to you so let's talk about the

00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,330
visual side of things a little bit

00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,179
because you've seen a bunch of pictures

00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:26,820
now yeah so the best presentations have

00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:29,940
visuals instead of text text takes you

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:32,190
time to read the visual effect then your

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,799
brain is much better at looking at

00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:37,559
images than a text so you need to use

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,740
that now so use pictures to make the

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:44,030
point or just give a general idea I mean

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:47,820
I've given presentations with random

00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:50,220
images I downloaded a bunch of images

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,890
very very badly from the internet and

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,540
use those and then you know had a very

00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:58,340
conceptual connection between what they

00:24:54,540 --> 00:25:01,830
were saying at the image but that's it

00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:05,130
that's fine that really fine it should

00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:09,600
be able to to have the slides or you

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:13,200
without the slides I remember if you

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,240
have graphs make them big have very few

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,440
details make sure they give only one

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:21,690
point have no text or very little text I

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:25,620
mean usually it's obvious what the x and

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:28,200
the y axis are in the graph so just skip

00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,480
the details and just say look this

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,440
represents death and that represents the

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,090
time and done you don't need to make

00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,000
everything obvious on the slide itself

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:42,809
just keep it really simple make sure

00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,630
that people guess get the point and no

00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:47,970
more then I'll need the details if you

00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:50,280
have a process picture simple simple

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:52,380
simple because processes they can go so

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,159
complicated nobody gets the point

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,039
anymore

00:25:53,159 --> 00:26:01,229
I would say just remove most of the

00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:04,379
details now this is terrible I mean the

00:26:01,229 --> 00:26:06,419
idea was probably to make a graphic but

00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:09,539
the concept of a graphic didn't really

00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:11,580
land with whoever made this and this is

00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:13,769
this is just a horrible way of

00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,919
disguising the fact that you really

00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:19,080
really wanted to use bullet points and

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:24,149
probably 20 different slides this is

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:28,200
just horrible now that's graph that's

00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:30,720
graph doesn't get any more simple

00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,789
actually you can still remove the dates

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,849
and the percentages right that that

00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:38,369
would be easy to but everybody gets the

00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:42,259
point and that's all that you need to

00:26:38,369 --> 00:26:42,259
get across right the details you give

00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:54,899
this is it it's pretty much the most

00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:59,519
important tips i have just repetition

00:26:54,899 --> 00:27:03,029
here introduce your presentation how

00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:05,809
long it is well it's about have clear

00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:08,899
story clear direction going from A to B

00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:11,279
make sure that you know your audience

00:27:08,899 --> 00:27:13,159
make sure that you know what you want to

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,700
tell them and what they have to remember

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:20,129
talk loud clearly given time to read the

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:21,629
slides if you have text on them make

00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:25,259
sure the slides support you don't

00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:29,090
replace you make sure that you don't you

00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:31,859
know overload them with information and

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,619
for those who are wondering yeah I like

00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:36,299
minimalism I mean this this is already

00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:38,429
too complicated for me I usually don't

00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:40,679
do that I have most of my presentations

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:43,289
have just pictures sometimes I put words

00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,840
on them but of course there are other

00:27:43,289 --> 00:27:48,090
ways and other styles I mean companies

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,690
usually really prefer am pleased to use

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:53,690
a you know slight style that's fine

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,500
slides can should be different there are

00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:00,210
there are many ways of doing it so I'm

00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:02,160
not saying this is the one and only way

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,050
if you see one of my other presentations

00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,210
here at the conference you will see that

00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,150
each of them has a very different style

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:12,630
of slides in the one about social skills

00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:15,780
for geeks had 12 slides with each and

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:19,740
XKCD comic on it and I think a few words

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:21,900
and there was quite different from some

00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,000
from this presentation for example so

00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:28,320
there are many ways of doing it and so

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,970
it should be personal I think that's

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,080
important that you'd fit you and how you

00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:42,060
work are any questions do you guys want

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:44,160
to go up some slides let's look at the

00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:48,920
slides and then if you can then stop the

00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,920
