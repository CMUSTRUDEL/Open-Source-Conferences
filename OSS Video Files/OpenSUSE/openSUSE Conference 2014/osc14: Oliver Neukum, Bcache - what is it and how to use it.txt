Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	SSDs are fast. They also cost a lot of money. To combine the speed of an SSD with the huge capacity of a rotational medium various caching solutions have been proposed. Some of them have found their way into the kernel and are easily usable with openSUSE. These solutions are briefly compared.
This talk shows the principle behind bcache, introduces the prerequisites of using it and demonstrates how to set up bcache on an added SSD to boost performance of an existing HD.
