Publication date: 2014-04-26
Playlist: openSUSE Conference 2014
Description: 
	Every member of the openSUSE community has a single identity that can be used to log into every openSUSE web-based service: from OBS to the forums, from the Wiki to Connect, from Lizards to infinity and beyond. This is possible thanks to the deployment of a technology called NetIQ Access Manager. This talk will provide an overview of this technology and the different existing alternatives to integrate a web application into the openSUSE Single Sign on system, with specific solutions for Ruby on Rails and Perl applications and generic mechanism that can be used for any web technology out there.
