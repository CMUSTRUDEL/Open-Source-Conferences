mean well it's been a really it is a

00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,090
really exciting time for opensuse the

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,430
last 12 months have been really

00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:51,760
interesting and we've learned an awful

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,740
lot and a lot of changes are underway

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,420
but also this conference is a good

00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,950
opportunity to start discussions about

00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:59,980
what other changes we need to do in the

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:03,220
project what should we change what can

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:07,900
we change how should it look in 12

00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:10,210
months time so yes there's already many

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,280
changes in parts of the project the

00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,620
parts I'm going to be talking about or

00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,850
we're going to be talking about

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,460
particularly the the marketing materials

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,790
the materials which we have around the

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,360
world of events that you know shall show

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:28,510
the project is where there's more to be

00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:32,310
in the development model is it working

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:35,860
doing to change it the release cycle is

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,540
eight months where it should be and yeah

00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,610
lots of other things but sticking on a

00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:44,830
few on just the few topics so marketing

00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,780
materials for the last 12 months maybe a

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,360
little bit longer and we haven't

00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,490
actually had any materials at any events

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,700
so our presence around the world has

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:58,300
been a lot less than it used to be

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:59,950
that's now finally changing with the new

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,180
materials you want to have open Suzie at

00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:03,220
a much bigger presence around the world

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,430
we want people to know what we are what

00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:09,610
we're doing how they can get involved we

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:10,690
can get more contributors but we need to

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,330
know which events are important to the

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:16,960
community and we have a list of what we

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:18,870
think but that list isn't complete so if

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,150

formalized sponsorship program so where

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:56,839

00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:15,490
sure what you contribute actually works

00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:18,649
and we want to encourage you to keep

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,709
working on the project in all the areas

00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:24,079
that you're interested in this

00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:27,339
conference is the ideal place to

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,480
actually speak to fellow contributors

00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:32,480
there are some people from other

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:37,279
projects here as well rookies here from

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:41,170
debian they've got lot of experience

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:44,029
knowledge in all areas

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:47,060
this place is the ideal time and

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:49,279
opportunity to grow your knowledge grow

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:58,459
you connections within the wider faust

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:59,959
environment so release cycle there's

00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:06,139
been lots of discussion over the past

00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:08,569
year about changing our cycle it's very

00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:09,920
important decision to be made and

00:15:08,569 --> 00:15:14,810
there's been some very good discussion

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:18,740
and it affects everyone from developers

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:21,079
to users to designers those that want

00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,620
make our own custom OS based alone susan

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:30,069
studio or whatever you know you name it

00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:34,279
it affects you lots of people stepped up

00:15:30,069 --> 00:15:37,480
and up the game so I'm 6013 to it's now

00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:37,480
going to be released in November

00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:47,389
slightly off our planned eight month

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:51,639
cycle but one of the questions is is the

00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:55,790
eighth month cycle of an old dog that's

00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,189
just wanting to sleep now and one of the

00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,540
questions is should we try something you

00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:02,360
doing it annually rather than eight

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,540
months and spend more time on polish

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:10,279
making sure that the release is as good

00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:13,610
as it can get or just try something

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:17,209
completely different not do a regular

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:20,779
release do rolling release every couple

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:25,160
of years follow other projects models

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:27,230
where we work on the development until

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:32,630
we decide that actually it's ready now

00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:36,259
let's push it out there's lots of

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:40,100
discussions to be had so think about

00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:42,199
what you want think paint your ideas if

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,180
you think you've got a good idea you

00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:49,100
want to discuss it with a wider group

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:52,100
got both sessions that you can have but

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,059
there will also be a project meeting on

00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,539
Sunday

00:16:53,059 --> 00:17:02,089
morning at ten am town hall meeting

00:16:56,539 --> 00:17:05,299
where you can raise your ideas and you

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:07,209
never know it could actually be a really

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:10,879
good idea even if you think it's crazy

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:15,110
so please don't hold back think out of

00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:25,730
the box try and be innovative and try

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:28,309
and prove the project hello we think

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,429
open source isn't actually in a great

00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:34,879
position to make very lot of big

00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:38,869
improvement over the next 12 months

00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:43,210
perhaps bit more we're especially

00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:46,940
excited about what says what the changes

00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:51,080
happier to factory our development

00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:54,049
process and was a big potential behind

00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:58,460
us and we are looking forward for a new

00:17:54,049 --> 00:18:00,919
greet google Summer of Code this year we

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:05,059
will have a couple of great enhancement

00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:10,490
in a minute during the next couple of

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:13,039
they have a great program we will don't

00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:17,059

Ted tenia and for inside those

00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:28,009
announcement we managed to get how a

00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:30,350
public cloud hacked together we have now

00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:35,330
a planet released normally later this

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:40,399
year and so we really hope suck you will

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:42,470
get excited excited and be here we are

00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:48,049
looking forward to make opens who's even

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:53,740
better than it has been and no i think i

00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:57,350
will let Vincent for some enhancement

00:18:53,740 --> 00:19:01,009
hey good morning so yeah we do have a

00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:02,899
couple of announcements we thought we

00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,420
would like to share the news with you at

00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:06,420
the

00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:09,690
of the events because it's important and

00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:12,950
then we can also discuss all that so the

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:16,650
first one is about local reimbursement

00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:19,500
look of material reimbursement we have

00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:21,300
the issue that for all the good stuff

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,390
like this and everything that we will

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,000
have in the even box we cannot send that

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,460
to small events because obviously not

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,180
all events are big enough for receiving

00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:35,940
tons of materials and so we've had

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,770
requests from several people are the

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:41,940
best humans and actually over the years

00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:45,270
to be able to produce locally some

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,980
materials for marketing and we wanted to

00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,680
be able to say yes to these people but

00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,270
we were not able to say that until now

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,100
so what we will do is that we will

00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:56,250
actually have a process which will be

00:19:53,100 --> 00:20:01,560
documented in the next few days and in

00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:03,870
charts people just sent a request and

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,640
this will be using the same process as

00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:11,370
the TSP so the same web application and

00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,400
there will be a committee which will be

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,620
led by Jim Henderson we actually also

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,920
need volunteers to help with with that

00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:22,050
then this committee will decide if this

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:24,570
is worth it or not and hopefully they

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,130
will say yes too many people and the

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,710
idea is that people will be able to

00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:31,950
request for materials up to two hundred

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:35,820
dollars per request and we have a budget

00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:38,400
allocated of 2k per quarter so we can

00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:41,820
sponsor like 10 small events like that

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,040
so it can be used by local events but it

00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,930
could also be used for universities who

00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,630
want to display some permanent posters

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:53,010
and so on and we believe it's a really

00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:54,600
good way to really extend our reach for

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,720
the project and to be able to be more

00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:00,930
present in many more locations so it's

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:04,290
really a good change talk about it talk

00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:06,330
about it around you are in your city in

00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:08,910
your lug and so on because we want

00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,150
people to make use of that to to spread

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:14,220
the word about opensuse the second

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,040
announcement is about the conference

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:20,640
next year

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:22,500
well there it is so we going to travel

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,860
again it's going to be The Hague in

00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:30,620
netherlands and so we had quite some

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:33,090
discussion about that and so we found a

00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:35,160
team of volunteers who are going to

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,340
organize that hence the Hat is going to

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:40,950
lead that and obviously we'll need help

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:42,900
from a lot of people so if you want to

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,580
help with that obviously first you

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,130
should focus on this event right now

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,480
because you can still help but if you

00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,310
want to help with the organization next

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,830
year you can step up you can help

00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,240
organize the event it's going to be we

00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:56,160
don't have the exact dates yet but it's

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,760
likely going to be April we you say that

00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:01,080
we want to keep the events in spring

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:02,820
because it makes sense for us and it

00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,640
really is likely to be the the right

00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:09,030
months for that there will be a talk

00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,700
from blue know on sunday i think sunday

00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:14,280
morning after the town hall meeting so

00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:18,120
it's going to be in this room to present

00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,040
well this event next year and so it will

00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,800
be a good time to just join has called

00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,070
your questions suggest all improvements

00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:30,300
you might have you might want to see

00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,430
next year for the event oh so it's it

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,230
will be exciting I think just from a

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:35,940
personal perspective we had correcting

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,150
the hague it was really great it was

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,760
like three four years ago it was amazing

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:44,760
um so that's it for the announcement um

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,580
I think we're reaching the end of this

00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:49,320
keynote we want you to have a lot of fun

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,070
during the next few days we want you to

00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:55,830
really talk to each other to go to the

00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:59,400
sessions ask questions contribute up

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:01,050
really don't be just listening but

00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,260
really contribute actively talk to

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:07,470
people raise questions express all your

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:09,300
IDs and this is really how we can make

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,310
the program the project move forward and

00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,230
progress so don't hesitate for that in

00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:15,960
really have a lot of fun Dubrovnik is a

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:17,610
great city don't also forget to just

busy the city because it's amazing it's

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:25,110
really beautiful so with that thanks I

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:27,900
guess and well the sessions will start

00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,590
in the next lecture at the element I

00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:42,140
