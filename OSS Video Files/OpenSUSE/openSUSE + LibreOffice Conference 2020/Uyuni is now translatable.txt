Title: Uyuni is now translatable
Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: openSUSE + LibreOffice Conference 2020
Description: 
	Uyuni is a software-defined infrastructure and configuration management solution. It bootstraps physical servers, creates VMs for virtualization and cloud, deploys and updates packages -even with content lifecycle management features-, builds container images, and tracks what runs on your Kubernetes clusters. All using Salt under the hood!

Uyuni provides you a high-class frontend solution to interact with Salt, manage your states, formulas with forms, and much more using a web UI. Or you could use our APIs.

All the major Linux distributions are supported: Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, openSUSE and we have reports of Oracle Linux and Fedora.

Uyuni is open source, backed by SUSE and actively developed.

This presentation will describe the challenges we faced when we wanted to make Uyuni translatable, and how to contribute a new translation. Hint: really easy now!

	00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,759
yep it looks good

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,759
okay then let's go for it

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,280
so my name is paul garcia i work for

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,759
souza

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,160
i'm the product owner i'm prospect

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,520
matter of sushi manager

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:26,080
which in a way makes me the

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,080
benevolent dictator of

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
uni

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,840
because uh uni is the upstream for suse

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
manager

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,120
okay so you can find me in guitar in

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,120
freenode by

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,039
email

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,360
and i want to first start by introducing

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,360
what

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,520
is your uni in case some of you may not

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,440
know it

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,960
so you need a systems management

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,360
solution so when you have a

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,559
ton of when you have tens of or hundreds

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
of thousands

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,920
of servers of linux machines you want to

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,360
manage

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,320
then you may find that manual

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,400
management or even some scripts that you

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,799
design yourself are not exactly

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,400
the easiest ways or things start to

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,759
scale to say if you start mixing

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,280
different linuxes

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,600
so we can manage with uni every kind of

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,040
workload from a single console or

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,640
api or command line tool we have

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,799
automated audit and reporting

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,400
capabilities that are always useful

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,400
in the enterprise world uh it does

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,560
software and hardware inventory which is

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,280
critical for compliance not even to just

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,880
know what you have at your company

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,560
and we can also do configuration

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,079
management you can deploy files for

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,200
instance you know

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,439
antivirus definitions or

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
configuration files so that all your

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,399
servers

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:56,079
are using exactly the same configuration

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
at least for some things

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,439
you can also do virtualization it can do

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,479
containers

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,399
uni is a huge beast

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,000
now this is the architecture of uni it's

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,479
a classical client

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,319
server application there's an element in

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,480
the middle called the proxy

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,440
which is optional as you can see you

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,640
know you

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,599
may have it or not have it the proxy is

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,760
just a

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,760
mean to offloading the

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,319
doubling the developing packages and

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,280
files that's essentially it but all the

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,160
the smart management is here in the

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,400
server

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,599
okay and we didn't start to uni

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,480
ourselves

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,319
right so let's use them in it it's

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,400
original an open source project by red

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,200
hat called spacewalk

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,239
which is rather old more than a decade

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,319
ago

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
it was the base for red hat satellite

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,000
five the current version red hat

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,519
satellite

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
is six it's based on something

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,959
completely different and also for

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,319
suicide three two

00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,319
in 2018 uh what we

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,319
realized that red hat was not really

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,239
interested in facebook anymore

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,120
they were not allowing the community to

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,400
take over

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
so we forked it and by the way spacewalk

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
the absolute

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,519
facebook project is is dead since a few

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,680
months ago

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:23,040
and red hat accumulates that uyuni is

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,159
the proper successor to his spacewalk

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,560
so why uni because uni is

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,680
the world the world's largest soul flat

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,680
originally spacewalk had its own

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,920
um client management stack

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,840
which is what we call the the

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,879
traditional stack

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,640
but we added as soon as they added salt

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,080
that company that vmware acquired

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,840
recently

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,959
so we use uh sold the open source

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,280
version and add a lot to it

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,400
and provide a nice ui automation and a

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,720
lot of other things

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,640
like although other features that sol

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,920
doesn't have by itself

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,599
um so yeah you can see the the the game

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,519
with the with the warts

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,959
there's salt reunion large the salt flat

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,639
um so you can migrate from spacewalk to

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
uni it just works or you can use the

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,400
assault

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,160
minion which is our preferred option

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,479
because all the new development

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
goes into sold me some bracing systems

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,960
are not even supported

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
as traditional clients so we focused

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,680
well

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,120
we do uni and susan manager by the way

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,720
we focused on having a simple

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
installation and adding advanced

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
features such as containers and

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
kubernetes integration scalability you

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,160
can scale

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,759
to tens of thousands of of clients with

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,360
a single server

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,800
um we wanted to to modernize also the

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,600
the ui and then the tools that the

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,440
event we migrated from python 2 and the

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,560
older versions of java you can see that

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,720
we continued

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,479
space walk and made it better because we

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,160
still believe that it was the the right

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,160
solution and the right architecture

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,680
it has been unity has been the upstream

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,840
for sushi minus since

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
version 4.0 two years ago

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,400
now oops um there's uh yeah there's a

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,240
slide missing here a

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,400
sub page which is uh translating is a

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
way of contributing to uni so when

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,600
people think of

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
uh contributing to an open source

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,000
project they usually think of

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,360
coding but that's not the only way of

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,680
contributing

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,680
um translating to your own language is a

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,880
good way so forth

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,680
in the past the space walk allowed

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,759
or had translations they become updated

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,919
a few years ago i would say

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,440
so we never shipped them with uni or

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,080
sushi manager

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,720
now we decided that we want to

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,440
reintroduce translations

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,240
and of course english is the the

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,919
language that

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,240
uni is developed in so when in doubt

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,080
always refer to the english version of

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,720
uni and the english documentation but

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,919
we have a very good japanese

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,280
translation it's completely done for the

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,759
software so for the

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,560
web ui and for the command line tools

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,160
documentation is not yet translated

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
but um there's this this guy who has

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,560
been

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919
working very hard for the past two

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,360
months

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,720
on his own and i'm really grateful to

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,639
him

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,240
there are other languages where we have

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,400
active translators

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,720
slovak czech brazilian portuguese and

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,440
spanish they still have a long way to go

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,960
and then there are a lot a ton of

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,960
obsolete translations and very

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,919
incomplete languages like french german

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,039
russian

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,080
arab esperanto i don't know

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,520
there's like 30 translations which

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,680
are in need of love i saw someone saying

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,840
that he will like he will be interested

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,199
or she will be interested in the intros

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,520
that into swedish

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,520
please

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,680
so how to start translating uni so when

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,199
we

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,440
um decided to to re-enable translations

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,800
we had to decide what to do how to do

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,479
this

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:30,479
and uh opensuse was offering

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,960
webplate and while it was

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,720
not so easy for documentation and i will

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,720
talk about that later

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,479
we got there so the easiest way is just

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,160
go to this url which is

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,240
opensuses webplate and start translating

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,360
it's really easy

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,080
you will find that it's a massive

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,720
thing so there's currently there's

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,520
110 000 words to translate if you want

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,319
to

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,000
translate a uniformly the web ui the

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
command line tools

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,479
the under documentation and i'm not even

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,599
including the api documentation there

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,160
because that's not translatable so far

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,199
and i

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,960
don't think it will ever be because it's

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,759
a massive book

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,240
and they will be used by very few people

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,440
but

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,319
so it's it's a challenge 110

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,080
000 words translate there's a ton of

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,000
components as you can see here

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,560
and i'm going to explain a bit what

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,560
these are

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,440
that's by the way a wiki page which i i

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,959
have included a link to it

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,479
explaining everything i'm going to

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,839
explain in full detail

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,440
okay so in case you have any doubt you

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,880
can refer to this wiki page

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,279
or just ask us in our guitar channels or

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,040
main

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,360
list there's also links to that at the

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,200
end of the presentation

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,959
now we can group all the around 20 or

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,560
more than 20 components and we have a

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,120
web laid in three groups

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,720
essentially there's the web ui there's

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,760
the command line tools and there's the

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,080
documentation

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,120
okay so web ui

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
web ui is internally it uses an xml

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,560
format called

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,320
xliff that's irrelevant to you because

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,640
what you see web late is

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
strings to translate okay there's

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,519
several web blade components

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,640
there's java jsp there's the java

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,560
database

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
there's you will see something called

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,480
web

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,240
all of those are the web ui

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
now translating is very easy you just go

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
to apply it click on select a language

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,279
select a component

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,760
and then pump start translating strings

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,120
there's a translation memory and there's

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,959
yeah really easy it's just it's missing

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,480
because it's it's around 40 000

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,240
40 000 words or even even slightly

00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,560
more testing these is not so

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,560
easy now if you want to see the outcome

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,600
of your own translation

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,560
and you want to to test it

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,399
immediately you need to essentially set

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,680
up a development environment

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,200
and rebuild the rpm packages in obs

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,480
so my advice will be just use unimaster

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,519
so we sync we synchronize the the

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
strings from

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,560
web led to the unit repository and

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,040
regenerate the the rpm packages daily

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,519
or almost daily for the synchronization

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,800
so that the signature from web blade

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,040
the the git repertory for the ui is is

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,120
for the web ui is not yet fully

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,920
automated we're working on this

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,399
on that but yeah it will still take a

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,959
few

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,440
weeks i think to have it automated if

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,399
you want to check something just ping us

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,079
on guitar or the mailing list and we

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,040
will make it happen

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,839
okay that's for the web ui which is one

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,640
of the most

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,760
interesting parts i would say i will

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,519
recommend the starting

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,120
with the web ui because it's something

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,120
that

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,880
it's where people really expect to see

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
translations

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,040
working then there's the command line

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,160
tools so uni has a few command line

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,519
tools

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,760
um they are not so often used but

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,640
there's a couple of them that are very

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,399
useful

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,320
for instance the space wall common

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,839
channels which is the tool that you need

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,959
to use in uni

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,480
to add products to to mirror the linux

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,320
distribution so we uni supports

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,040
essentially every enterprise industry

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,440
out there

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,480
we support uh switzerland's enterprise

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,640
world rehab

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,560
enterprise linux who support oracle

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,399
linux centos until

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,000
debian uh yeah something called

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,760
uh southerly with enterprise expanded

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,279
support and there's even

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,040
reports of people making managing fedora

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,920
and aws amazon linux with these amazon

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,600
links too

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,720
so yeah you can see that you need to

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,560
initially add those products

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
and uh spaceball common channels is the

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,160
tool you need to to use to that so

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:09,200
that's a good tool to translate

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
it's in the back end component there's

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,160
another tool

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,839
called called space cmd space india

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,120
allows you to do everything you can do

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
from the web ui

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,519
but from the command line okay so for

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,399
instance if you are

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,680
you have a if you are visually impaired

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,360
and you will prefer

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,639
to use or yeah or you need a hearing aid

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,240
and you will

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,519
rather use a command line tool and and

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,240
some reader reader or something like

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
that

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,240
then um yeah space cmd becomes important

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,040
tool

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,040
okay there's a lot less strings to

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,480
translate in the command line tools it's

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,000
um all put together all combined around

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,320
ten thousand words

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,200
there's several uh web blade components

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,440
again sphnd the back end

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,200
um yeah it's like three or four

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
components

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,760
translating is again very easy the fact

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,000
that this is using get text internally

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,279
is relevant to you you can use just go

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,200
to web blade

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,320
click on a component and start

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
translating

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,680
that's it the translation memory works

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,079
beautifully for this

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,839
because there are short strings and they

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,279
are you will see that when you start

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,800
translating something

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,240
magically some a little bit certain

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,480
increments in some other component

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
that's because web light is reusing

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,680
your translation for in one place to

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,639
another place

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,040
where it found exactly the same string

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,639
now again testing is not so easy

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,600
because you need to set up a development

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:44,079
environment rebuild the rpm packages

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,360
but again yeah you can use unimaster

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,519
set up a vm with unimaster and and

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,279
daily you will get the new translation

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,000
the alternative in this case is rather

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,800
easy

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,600
you can uh since it's get text you you

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,639
can

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,560
clone the git repertory for uni and

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,959
compile the po files

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,240
to the binary get text files with

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,480
message format

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,600
this tool which is included in the get

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
text package

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,519
and that's it just replace the file on

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,040
this if you are really

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,639
desperate and you want to test it in

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,140
real time

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,279
and don't want to rebuild the packages

00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,720
[Music]

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,079
again these strings are not synchronized

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,600
in real time

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,639
but it takes maybe one day two days

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,519
because we do this

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,800
manually so far it's some part of it is

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,160
automated the other part

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,040
the merging into the the master branch

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,720
is not automated

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,720
due to a limitation in github

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,720
so that that's uh the the two let's say

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
the software's

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,160
what we call the software strings the

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,720
web ui and the command line tools but

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,360
what about documentation this is where

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,760
it got

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
hairy i have to say our documentation is

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,920
written in ascii doc

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,920
and ascii log is a format that no

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,399
translation tool supports

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,560
unfortunately we also use the antura

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,000
build system but that's yeah

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,800
and not so important so

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
there's some yeah some details about it

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,320
that requires some

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,680
work initially but most of the work went

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,160
into asking

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,160
so what are we doing with ascii doc we

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,760
are trying converting ascii doc to get

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,760
text using a tool called

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,720
po4a so it's a po

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,519
for all and then submitting that to

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,639
weblade

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:35,120
to translate okay we we never keep the

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,720
the translations the ascii doc for the

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
translations in the gear reproduction we

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,560
don't need to that because

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,160
that's generated content i mentioned

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,959
that because that's a question that

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,079
comes very often translating is very

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,320
easy

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,480
testing is very easy and in case you

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,160
have some difficulties setting up our

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,240
documentation tool chain we have

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,639
prepared a vm and a container

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,320
the container is not yet in under uni

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,800
project but it should be

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,839
in the coming days so if you go to the

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,800
wiki page that i

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,040
i mentioned earlier and i will link

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,199
after at the end of the presentation

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,079
uh you will find the information how to

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,480
download this

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,160
it's of course everything is under

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,120
github.com

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,639
uni project okay so either the vm the vm

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
event includes a clone of the git

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,040
repository

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,160
a browser so that you just need to spawn

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,040
the pm

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:30,000
and start translating immediately and

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,240
then you can test it yourself

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,240
oops in the case of the of the

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,759
uh the documentation the translation

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
memory

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:44,480
does not really work that well

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:48,079
because in order for it to work you will

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,480
need to match the full paragraph

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,120
which is not really something that you

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,600
find too often

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,560
um so the translation memory is really

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,600
the only

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:02,720
case where it reduces strings

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,720
is essentially on lists that's something

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,959
that we are trying to work

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:13,280
with the upstream po4 a project

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,280
but it's not going to be too easy

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,959
the the good thing is that are committed

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,600
immediately so

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,039
this is since synchronized even almost

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,280
in real time

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,480
and you can even click on on commit

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,000
yourself or ask

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,400
us in the in in guitar and

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
we will commit immediately so the

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,600
translation comes very very

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,919
fast much faster than the software's

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,919
rings

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,039
and that's essentially it so next thing

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,200
will be just

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
yeah you can contribute to our community

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,480
to uni community

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
we are part associated in a way with

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,400
open souza

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,520
um many of us are student employees also

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,520
by the way

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
so we have the mailing lists we have set

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,160
up a mailing list for translators by the

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
way it was

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,679
created i think today it's who you need

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,039
translation

00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,080
topicsuite.org we have a guitar chat

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,720
where you can find

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,280
a lot of people from the community and

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,320
you have

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,760
they could have reporters

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,520
if you want to continue this code you

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,240
will find here some instructions or if

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,000
you want to

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,000
set up your development environment to

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,360
test in real time your translation

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,799
and if you want to continue with

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,039
translations this is their webplate link

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,960
this is the the wiki page where

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,600
everything explained

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,640
component per component with the even

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,280
the

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,160
the markup is explained here in

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,480
indication

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,520
where some markup is used like in the

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,400
documentation

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,600
and here's the link to the vm with their

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,919
unity docs

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,919
toolchain with ascii dog doctor

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,320
and torah everything's here with all the

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:59,280
ruby gems that we need

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:59,280
so that it's easy peasy

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,559
by the way we are also participating in

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,440
october first

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,160
so if you want to translate to youtube

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,039
language

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,360
you can get a t-shirt for free just

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,320
translate one thousand words

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,160
or strings and claim it you will find

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,039
for more information about hector fest

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
here

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,080
it's an initiative it's not by suze or

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,039
urban suite it's

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,240
by this delusion it's very famous this

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,720
year there have been some

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,760
yeah slight problems with it but this

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,200
delusion has

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:37,679
quickly fixed them so you can get

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,679
your t-shirt by translating no need

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,320
for coding which is if you look at the

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,120
most of the factor first

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,120
challenges or

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,360
problems most of them are related to

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,160
code

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,160
now we also accept translations

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,679
i can do a little demo or i think we

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:07,840
have still a few minutes

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:07,840
for more questions questions so far

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:17,440
none okay then i'm going to

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:21,280
do the demo okay

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,520
yes uh stop sharing that

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,520
thing

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:35,840
by the way my camera was not on

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:49,840
yes select a window

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,840
um here

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:58,240
yeah can you see my screen now

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,960
who you need yes we are played okay then

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,159
so here is uh as i said these are all

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,520
the components

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,440
you will see that all the docs

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,600
components have docs

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
before it i would recommend as i said

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,720
earlier

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,039
always start with the software strings

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,000
and refer to the documentation when you

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,919
have you're in doubt about something but

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,880
the documentation changes very often we

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,919
uh

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,559
we are improving it like every day and

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,679
there's

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,600
uh almost 800 pages of documentation so

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,200
if you uh start with the condition you

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,240
may find that

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,280
your translation becomes outdated

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,240
uh quite soon let's say

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,960
especially after in the second half of

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,480
the year

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,360
it's like crazy okay so let's say i want

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,159
to translate

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,400
um these just mod no this one it sounds

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,440
like

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,200
already to spanish let's say i want to

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,640
translate something in the back end

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,520
i will go to the back end try to find

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,120
the language that you see

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:05,520
there's albania arabic as a means

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,520
check 100 thank you

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,960
japanese 100

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,280
spanish yeah half done so

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:20,159
just click here it says there's

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:23,280
384 strings to go

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,320
almost 3 000 words i will go for it

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,520
translate and yeah

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,960
this this this means that uh this

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,520
string was marked for

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,200
uh radio so it needs anything and i can

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,400
tell you that

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,080
this string really needed anything

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,840
because it was wrong

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,520
your system was not found in the product

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,640
name this is a placeholder that we use

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,960
database yeah and you can see that this

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,799
string this translation came from

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:58,720
spacewalk because it said rhn

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:02,400
now i have fixed it save

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,000
and that's it and then the next one is

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,559
here

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,760
yeah this one is good okay

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:14,880
this one uh okay

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,840
this one is uh this one needs fixing

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,240
actually

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,080
in the in the original language in

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
english i'm going to try to find

00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,280
something which is not translated yet

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,400
because

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,280
this is boring i'm going to just

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,240
jump to 150 let's see this is not true

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,720
okay

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,600
so the important thing is you always

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,440
need

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,320
to uh yeah these placeholders the spaces

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,960
make sure that you don't change them

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,000
because

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,679
otherwise it might it might look

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,520
uh bad on the screen so what i in case

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,440
when this markup what they usually do is

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,360
i click on copy here

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,960
it copies this frame with all the markup

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,240
and everything and then i replace your

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:00,960
error

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:05,840
so this path under server mount point

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,840
do not exist

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
okay

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,720
[Music]

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:21,360
and that's it done

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,640
see this is super easy it's something

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,520
that you have 10 minutes you want to

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,279
translate

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,279
five strings done

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:36,559
super super easy command line yeah

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:40,880
oops oh god hello paul

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:44,480
may i ask you a question of course

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,840
are you planning to integrate in the

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
release plan something like this spring

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,840
freeze

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:55,120
or a period where the translators

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,679
can translate being sure that the

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,840
strings

00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,240
will be that one without changes and so

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,600
on um

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,279
that's a good question that's a very

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,679
good question so so far

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:11,120
the the the freeze that the code freezes

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:14,960
that we have for uni is very very short

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,720
um and we will so

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,240
the answer will be so far we have not

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,279
had this problem but yes

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,960
that's a very good point and we need for

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,640
sushi manager we have a solution for

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,279
that because we have a slightly

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,480
longer freeze period but definitely for

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,840
uni we need to

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,880
to find a freeze date and

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,279
award translators the deploy

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,200
we have not even thought of this yet

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,200
because all the translations say for

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,760
japanese are so incomplete

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,840
that it doesn't make sense to ship any

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,799
translation at this point

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
right but yeah that's definitely a good

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,120
point that we should

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,000
freeze at least i guess

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,120
a few days how much time will you

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,440
suggest

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,320
one week more than one week software

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,200
because

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:08,799
old we really take every month

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,799
every month so more than one week

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,679
yeah in general depends how big is the

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,200
translation team if you have a

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,240
one person will be a full-time job

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,600
so it depends yeah it doesn't change too

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,000
often so the servers

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,720
do not change that often and then for

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,799
the for the documentation

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,000
even if the translation is a bit

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,960
outdated

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,919
it's not that bad because um we are

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,799
going to include

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,679
this disclaimer saying the authoritative

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,279
translation

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,200
of the recommendation is on the other

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:44,400
the language of the documentation is

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,919
english the translations might be a bit

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
outdated the the

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,360
the bad thing is with the software

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,480
string because if

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,919
if you are seeing or using uni in

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,640
italian and then you

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,080
suddenly find the string in english you

00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,559
will think

00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,240
[Music]

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,440
i don't like this right

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,919
now i go that i agree i mean

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,120
the new language should be made

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,039
available only

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,200
if you have the different translation

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,159
something incomplete it's

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,080
definitely not professional yes so the

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,679
thing is the software strings do not

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,240
really change a lot

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,679
these days so it's when we add new

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,360
features or improve

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,720
some things in the second half of the

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:30,000
year uh

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,159
it's usually very small features that

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,039
do not come with a lot of associated

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
strings or even

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,520
with no strings at all because it's

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,120
improvements in their back account

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,120
now in the first half of the year which

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,840
is where we

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,000
versus mostly contributes to uni with

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,760
new features with

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,320
say neatly new features features

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,520
that's where new software strings may

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,039
appear very quickly

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,840
like every every few or every week

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,159
even that means that for in the first

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,720
half of the year we will definitely need

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:09,919
to agree on a software string

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,919
and a translation grace yes

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,840
that's a very good point and we will

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,840
make a note of that thank you

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:31,840
more questions

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:40,240
uh yeah one more for the

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,320
translation theme uh do you have a

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,159
something

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,600
in the documentation that you were

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,240
showing uh

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,960
pointing out which are the contacts of

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,480
of the

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,039
translators already active uh for the

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,440
different languages

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,240
sorry come again is there any active

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,360
what

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,760
uh if you have a in the wiki if you have

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,760
a

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,559
a list or or a contact something uh

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,880
of the different uh translation theme

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,120
just for having a reference from someone

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,120
you're

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:21,360
yes no there's no no translation themes

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:25,360
so far we have these mailing lists that

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:29,039
will has been created today i think

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,919
we you need translation mailing list

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,200
uh wrote it in the chat but no if you

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,919
want to find about

00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,760
a language who translate it the easiest

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,120
way is you go to

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,720
their language let's see for instance

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,480
i don't think we have anyone translating

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,480
to italian so far let's see

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,960
uh i was checking because uh there are

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:52,559
translations so i don't know if

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,159
all the from uh yes those are probably

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,080
all yes yes yeah you can see it so

00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,799
michael carman pascal are

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,840
two of the guys who worked on enabling

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,120
this

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,720
oh there's this fito okay

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,159
yeah it's a known one yes also

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:16,799
on the libreoffice side

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:19,919
yeah he also turned race to spanish yeah

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,919
okay yeah so no we don't have this but

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,159
that's also a good idea to

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,159
add this to the wiki yeah

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,320
very good suggestions you and me need to

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,960

your fault in the next time okay

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:52,240
it's fine okay just a small web

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,480
you can extract reports of translations

00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,440
on webblade if you want to update your

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,279
wiki

00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,559
with translators there is a

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,559
part where you can

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:11,919
extract reports on translations

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,919
and switches number of screens and so on

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:20,559
