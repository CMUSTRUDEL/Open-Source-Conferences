italian member of the libreoffice

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,799
community so liber italia it's

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,880
yeah i know it's quite easy to

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,520
understand

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,840
then i am a tdf member and i'm currently

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,479
committee

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,560
uh on the open source side

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:30,240
i am currently in the board and

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,799
obviously i'm not research addicted

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:38,960
so i am really trying to

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,640
learn a lot i'm curious and i'm

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,000
really happy to attend this event also

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,560
for uh

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,200
learning uh something new from uh all

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,640
the other

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,320
presenters and uh apart from

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,439
the open source activities

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,119
in my daily life i'm

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,200
a maintenance release coordination

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,040
engineer at souza

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,319
and yeah you will learn more about

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,599
this part in another talk that

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,640
i will give during the conference uh

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,200
talking about maintenance uh but

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,000
as i said before today i want to talk

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,959
about

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,640
a topic that is really important to me

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,680
that is the

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,879
localization of libreoffice and the

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,800
support that the users can can have

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:36,080
in italian while using a libreoffice

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,280
so the agenda for today is uh indeed

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,000
a status update of what

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,879
we are facing now uh which are the

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,400
issues

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,680
uh what we are trying to to do for uh

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,120
solving uh the issues

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,160
and in general the next step that

00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,400
we are planning and uh that

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,560
we are trying to to follow one by one

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,400
so this status this status is definitely

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,599
not a nice one

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,640
because uh if you look at the

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,560
libreoffice at the source code you will

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,080
unfortunately see that

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,159
the last update for the language tools

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,879
so the um the dictionary

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,920
uh the thesaurus and the so all the

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,120
other tools that

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,879
in general are supporting someone while

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:36,080
using libreoffice were updated last time

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,519
in 2010 so i think that

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,440
after 10 years it's definitely

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,480
time to take action to do something

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,760
for improving

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,920
uh the the current status

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,120
uh why uh this status is this one

00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,879
because definitely um at

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,239
the open office time in

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,879
italy there was the player that was the

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
association that was mainly taking care

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,360
of

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,280
all the activities around

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,320
localization for uh at that time

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,880
open office uh in the reality was not

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,919
just

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,759
the linguistic project but was uh the

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,440
community behind the

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,880
open office in italy so

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,240
as a a normal extension of these

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,120
activities the pleo was

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
taking care of the language tool and

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,600
with

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,040
taking care i mean that there were

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,080
really good experience and skilled uh

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,440
contributors working on the dictionary

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,199
working on the

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,960
on the this hours and

00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,800
taking care of updating it maintaining

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,160
and so on and everything was uh

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,600
working let's say in a normal way

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,639
uh until there was the the fork

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,560
and until we moved to

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,759
libreoffice so the the problem there

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,759
was that the

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,199
the last letter of that acronym the o

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,400
means open office and they definitely

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
decided to stay with the the open office

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,240
project

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,240
and then with apache open office so

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:42,560
in all this time

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,560
was really not possible to

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,000
to ever update on the

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,680
on the dictionary and all the other

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,360
language tools

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,639
because the knowledge on

00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:01,440
the topic was uh completely there

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:05,919
and because they were the the maintainer

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:09,680
and yeah as you can imagine was uh

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:12,639
exactly not easy uh when

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
there is a fork on going to to keep all

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,560
the community

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,759
together so it can happen it's not just

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,600
something

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,720
common uh in the liberal office area

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,440
it's uh it's open source and there are

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,479
frictions in the community in the

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,319
communities

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:37,039
so in um in

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:41,280
several occasions the current uh

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:44,800
localization team of libreoffice

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,520
uh was trying to contact

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,000
the people that were maintaining the

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,160
language

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,599
tools on the apache side but

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:59,199
we had no success we got really

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:02,639
no answers so that was a

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,120
mainly the starting point

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
of something that was uh definitely not

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,440
updated

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:15,120
for uh too many years um

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:18,479
apart from this we discovered that

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,680
there was an extensions an extension

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:25,120
that was uh developed by the uh

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,680
old existing uh maintainer

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,720
that was uh last updated uh around 2015

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,520
but that was uh not merged with

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:41,919
the existing code

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,759
libreoffice code i mean and

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:50,960
this extension is only available on the

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,520
apache open office extension website

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,160
so from the libreoffice point of view

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,759
the main

00:07:54,160 --> 00:08:00,479
issue is that if you are just installing

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,160
libreoffice you have the dictionary and

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,879
all the other language tools

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,000
that are installed by default because

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,240
italian is a

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
is a language that is supported by a

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,160
library office

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,360
with a let's say one of the main

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,960
languages that are

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,639
directly built in the in the core

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,199
and the updated version

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,039
is uh in an external place so you need

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
to know that you need to search for the

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,000
extension

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,840
then you need to install it so the

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,519
majority of the people are just

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,000
installing the default version from

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,839
the tdf website or in general from the

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
linux distribution and so on

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:45,760
and are getting a really old

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:50,160
10 years old language tools

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:54,640
and the other

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:58,560
difficulty was definitely that

00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:02,720
the maintainers were really not reacting

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,760
but they are still listed as maintainers

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,800
and the side effect

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,720
is that it's uh technically not not

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,640
possible to submit something

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,910
because the responsible is not answering

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,200
and it's really not clear

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:23,440
[Music]

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,880
what to do so we had this uh phase of uh

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,160
waiting uh uh trying to uh

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,399
trying to talk trying to uh

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,680
solve the problem uh without uh

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,760
a really direct action

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,760
uh but this um polite way was definitely

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,120
not working so uh

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,800
after 10 years the decision

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,440
is taken so the libertalia association

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,480
decided to take over

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:02,640
the maintenance of these language tools

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,519
for for the italian language so

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
we can say that uh yeah libertalia is

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,800
forking

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,079
the old uh the other language support

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,320
that was uh provided

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:21,760
at that time uh by open office

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,360
and was just another

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,350
interesting coincidence in our community

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
we have also other

00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:32,640
[Music]

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,760
people contributing to the mozilla

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,000
projects and the

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,440
italian mozilla community was just

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
contacting

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,920
the italian localization team from

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,120
libreoffice

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
asking to try to work together on the

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,040
dictionary

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,240
and the other language tools because

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,360
also on the mozilla side they are just

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,720
reusing

00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:02,079
the existing uh package that was

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,120
built at the open office time

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,160
so in parallel

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,279
with this the

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,040
italian community decided also to

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,800
migrate all the localization materials

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,920
from an existing all the

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,680
dropbox instance to the tdf

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,480
next cloud the reasons

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,040
are not just for migrating away from

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,880
something

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,920
that is a closet source and uh

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,000
it's not uh following the spirit

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,720
of an open source community but

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,360
the other idea was also to be to be able

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,200
to

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,560
keep all the informations all the

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,399
documentation and all

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,120
the materials available to the

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,480
contributors that are currently part of

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,519
the community

00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,360
but having everything centralized

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:04,160
at tdf is also a way to

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,240
keep these informations available uh

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,360
also when

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
some community member maybe will decide

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,560
to to

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,600
live or new one will join

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,560
the tdf umbrella should uh support

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,560
the community also on on this side

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,839
centralizing

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,920
the the materials so

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:34,079
for this we were also reorganizing uh

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:37,040
the really huge pickup of documents uh

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,600
internal guides and so on moving

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,370
everything

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,880
to the tdf next cloud and

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:46,399
[Music]

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,079
the other really hard and difficult part

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:53,200
was definitely to try to redrive

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,320
the all the information that we had at

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,680
the

00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:02,160
open office and clio time because

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:05,360
this documentation was shared only

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,040
across the team that the small team

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,240
that was making uh the language tools

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,240
for for the italian language and

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,760
we lost the contact with them so at the

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,399
moment uh

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,360
we were at the beginning when we decided

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,399
to

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
to finally restart the process we were

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,360
really

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:31,839
without the information

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,959
without updated files so we were just

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,480
able to grab what was available in the

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,560
switch code

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:44,079
from libreoffice core in the sub module

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:48,800
that is providing

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:52,959
the italian language and

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:56,000
there was uh uh there were some other

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,800
uh documents uh saved locally by

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,639
other contributors but uh yeah it was a

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,839
really process

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,800
uh the the old and boring process of

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,519
checking archives because we hope to

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,440
have

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:14,639
something uh helpful uh to reuse

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,399
and uh what we are

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,440
definitely doing is to start to document

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
everything

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,920
so the idea is to also update

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,120
what is needed on the tdf side on the

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,800
main

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,120
wiki uh for uh being sure that

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,079
everyone that wants to contribute can

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,600
find

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,399
an easy way to to start not only just

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,639
contacting

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:47,519
the existing uh translation group

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:50,560
and uh yeah did the next step

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,839
that we started there was uh the

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:56,079
cleaning up of the existing dictionary

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,760
we decided to start from the dictionary

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,199
because

00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,959
we were in the position to start

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,000
completely from scratch

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:07,440
also uh for collecting

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
uh the the really basic how-to

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,560
uh for handling the the files and in

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
general

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,959
they dictionary from the language tool

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,160
is probably

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,959
the easiest and yeah

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:26,639
it's not an easy an easy task to do it's

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:29,680
really a long one but at least the

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,880
cleaning up it's uh something

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,079
that can also help to uh

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,040
start to keep in contact

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,079
with uh with the five format and the

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,120
different rules

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,639
for creating the dictionary

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,460
uh then what

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,600
we we want to do is definitely to

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,680
[Music]

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,600
join the forces with the mozilla folks

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,959
also because they are willing to to work

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,399
on the topic

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:08,399
and doesn't make any sense to just

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:10,560
fork something across two different

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,800
communities that are active on the very

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,880
same topic it's just a waste of time and

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,399
a waste of resources

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,519
and all together we can make

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,880
the language support definitely better

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,240
than now

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,600
and as a

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,720
side effect of this we want to

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,480
definitely share more how to create

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:40,000
and edit all these uh

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,800
dictionaries and files that are normally

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,160
provided

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:47,199
with a with libreoffice and

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:52,160
yeah the the first comment is

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:55,440
uh it's ready the plan was to

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:58,480
submit it uh just during the conference

00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,639
also for celebrating a bit uh

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,679
these huge anniversary after 10 years

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:09,600
of all the dictionary

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:11,919
we are ready to restart and uh submit

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,720
the the new version so the comment is

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,199
ready uh in the next days

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,720
we want to push the the first uh the

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,839
first comment on uh

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,039
on garrett uh and yeah

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,079
then we will wait for uh

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:31,520
uh the senior uh

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,080
developers that will will do the review

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,840
and

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,799
we'll decide to approve or ask for uh

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,840
more changes before before merging uh

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:43,760
the

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:48,320
uh the submission so we are uh

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:51,440
it's a nice feeling it's that

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,480
exciting moment when you know that

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,520
finally uh things are moving on and uh

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,960
and improving and uh

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,320
yeah uh another thing that

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:07,360
uh another step that we want to uh

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,840
to keep in the list and to uh

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,039
start it's definitely it's definitely to

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:19,520
involve also more expert on the topic

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,520
because we we don't want just to

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:26,559
update the dictionary

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,000
but there is the thesaurus that

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:34,240
it's a bit more tricky or all the other

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,679
i foundation tools and uh yeah we

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,960
we know that in in our localization team

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,160
in any case there are

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,440
uh experts on on this topic

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,720
and we were already discussing uh and uh

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,360
yeah we definitely need to to involve

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,240
all the resources that are already

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,520
available

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,720
attend directly in our community

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,919
and another another step

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:06,400
that uh maybe a bit more with

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:11,120
my membership committee head

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:13,760
i want to really try to find a way to

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,039
to make possible to have a much more

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,480
contributors

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:22,080
just editing the files

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,120
and being able to to push what is uh

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,240
needed for improving the uh

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,880
the language tools uh the feeling that

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,440
we had

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,240
until now was really was really bad

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,280
because

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:39,039
we had some ideas but uh

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,280
we were without the knowledge uh

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:43,520
and we were not able to to improve

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,280
something that was uh waiting for us

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,880
so i definitely want to

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,280
bring more uh more people directly on

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,559
the

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,520
on the code level uh pushing the

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,120
changes for the for the starting with

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,080
the dictionary but also with

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,840
the rest of the language tools for for

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,880
italian

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,960
so something else

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,000
that could happen it's definitely to

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:18,880
um ask to to the other

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:22,720
localization teams that are already

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:26,559
updating uh in really frequently

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:29,360
uh the the language support tools

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,039
uh also for uh understanding if maybe

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,080
there is a smart way to

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,280
a smarter way to do things and so on

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:42,000
and for uh for the

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:48,159
tools there is the already used

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:50,799
proofing tool that is a a really nice

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:52,240
graphical user interface developed by

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,440
marco pinto

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,000
for editing the defiles without being

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,520
forced

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,200
to directly edit manually

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:07,039
the the file with a bit of risk to

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:10,080
maybe create a mess in the

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,120
in the important files for the

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,159
language support so we have definitely a

00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:17,360
lot to do

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,320
and i would really love to to do this

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,880
work

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,679
uh all together starting with the

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,360
existing

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:28,640
italian italian localization team

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,120
uh but definitely uh learning more also

00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,840
from

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,840
from the other

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,919
localization community and uh why not

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,200
also

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,280
