hello hello so

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,360
it seems to me that it is utc uh four

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,639
o'clock

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,759
so should i start love tells me i should

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,640
start so maybe

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
you can even hear me so is that so can

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,199
you hear me

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,519
yes we can hear you awesome yes

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
yes so thank you for making this this

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,880
conference possible even

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,400
with this uh conditions like that we

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,039
have these days that

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
that all of us uh have to sit at home so

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,360
so greetings

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,600
for my from my office actually uh so

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,960
so maybe you can see me in the small

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,480
corner in there

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,120
in the bottom uh bottom corner

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,600
so if it's applying too much space like

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,600
i will

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,960
try to remove myself later but so far

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,199
let's try it with me

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,160
in the view so i'm going to talk about

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,559
the chrome os

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,000
as a new platform so who of you haven't

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,640
seen a chromebook

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,720
so it is something that looks like this

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,840
so it is like looking like a normal

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,040
a normal laptop but like

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,159
inside it is again a normal laptop it is

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,280
not like

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,240
somehow too exciting hardware that is

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,920
inside

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,920
but on the other hand like it's quite

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,280
exciting like from the

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,439
uh from the software point of view so

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,119
like if uh if you read like on wikipedia

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,000
what actually chromebook is

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,400
uh like it's a laptop or tablet that is

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
running

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,000
linux based chrome os is this operating

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,920
system

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
so like this is this is exciting that it

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,479
is linux based because

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,960
like it gives you a lot of opportunities

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,799
to do things uh things with that and

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,280
actually like the chromos guys

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,799
apparently are taking it to the to the

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,920
limits like very well

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,960
um as you uh will hear later in this is

00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,159
this presentation the chrome os it's uh

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,799
instead uh itself like is

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
again two linux based operating system

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,080
designed by google

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:12,080
it was announced in not 200

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,400
but in 2009 and uh it was targeted to

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,000
run

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,160
everything in the browser actually

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,800
initially at least initially

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,599
so uh the main target were web

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,280
applications

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,280
so like gmail and these things that like

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
run basically on the server and then you

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,319
have some like very thin javascript

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,160
layer around that that like provides you

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,640
with the user interface and everything

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,400
that you

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,519
you can and want to do as the user

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,080
then in addition to this uh thing these

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
web

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,000
web applications they're very chrome

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,239
apps uh that were available

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,360
from the uh from the chrome web store

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,640
again like uh they were uh um they were

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,040
things that were

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,480
uh that were running in the browser but

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,239
they're somehow packaged

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,280
uh into into a thing that you would ab

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,080
you were able to launch uh like directly

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,239
from the browser

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
like you have downloaded that have had

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,879
that running in the

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,920
in the browser uh but like it

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,800
seemed that it wasn't the the best idea

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,879
there so

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,840
uh they started phasing that out in 2016

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,879
and i think like this year they are even

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
like terminate this

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,400
support for that like in the uh in the

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,480
chrome

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,720
um the browser

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,080
uh so there are more possibilities these

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,760
ways uh these days

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,519
which are more exciting uh so there are

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,799
the android apps

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,080
um so the the chrome os

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,599
itself runs a layer uh that is like the

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,959
the complete android

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,840
and and like you can

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,439
you can run the android apps uh inside

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,400
uh inside this layer

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,200
uh so this is available uh in the in the

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,360
chrome os

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:07,519
uh since 2014 and google play

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,200
uh was added uh uh to the to the mix

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,200
uh like so that like you are able to

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,720
install things directly from google play

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,040
into since 2000 to 2016.

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
and what is good about this is that like

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,759
it is enabled

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
on the chromebooks these days like by

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,320
default so

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199
like when you buy a chromebook you are

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,400
able to

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,840
uh to install the android apps just out

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,560
of the box

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,960
another very exciting possibility um

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,199
that

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,199
is in the chrome os is actually a linux

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,840
terminal and applications

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,800
but like it is not directly the terminal

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,639
that you would run

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,520
um like where the when the chrome os

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,680
itself runs but it is an additional

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,919
virtual machine on top of that

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,320
by a project called crostini and

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,240
it has to be enabled so like you have to

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,440
go into the settings

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,240
uh that is on the on the chromebook and

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,120
uh then you have to switch something

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,560
that will

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,440
like tell you like i'm going to download

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,400
some 500 packs megabytes of stuff and

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,320
and install it on your computer and and

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,680
like warns you several times but then

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
like when you have it

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,120
you have a full linux operating system

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,440
on top of

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
the linux operating system which is

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,600
exciting

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
and you can install the debian uh debian

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,120
packages

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,520
just fine even like there's support for

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,080
like

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,080
you click on something in the you know

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,600
the chrome os itself and it installs it

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,720
directly into the

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,400
into the linux vm so for example android

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,880
studio installs this way

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,440
uh unfortunately i like it didn't work

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,520
for me

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
like uh too well this android studio

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,960
like the the graphics was not working

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
too well on this exact

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,560
uh chromebook i have but apparently like

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,400
it's

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,400
working better for for others

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,280
so uh we are considering like what to

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,479
choose

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,240
uh for our uh our application

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,919
that like we wanted to have on the on

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,840
the chromebook

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:17,120
and uh like it would be uh nice to

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,039
uh use the the the libreoffice like

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,160
right away and it is even possible like

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,960
you can in this

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,360
in this linux layer you can do a studio

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,039
app

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,479
install libreoffice and you will get it

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,680
there

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,319
but on the other hand like it is not

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,840
that accessible for the normal users

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,960
because like it is not enabled by

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,720
default this vm

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,720
and also it is not

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
uh not something that that would be like

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,240
two familiar photo users like they want

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,479
to search in the apps they want to see

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,440
reviews of other people of software and

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,800
stuff so

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:54,479
the solution uh here that we

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,479
wanted to use uh was like take the

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,720
existing or pre-existing collaborate

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,000
office android app

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,880
and try to make it work so that

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,919
so that it installs on the on the

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,520
chromebook

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:13,440
directly from the google play and

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,440
and basically you you have it

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,039
and what a surprise like it worked out

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,120
of the box

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,199
well kind of of course uh because

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,759
like the presentation hasn't ended yet

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,840
right i have still some 20 minutes

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:32,160
so uh like when you install that

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,360
you were able to see the the shell of

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,919
the of the

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,919
collaborator office app but you were

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,080
actually unable to open files

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,840
so like when you have opened the default

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,080
picker for the staff

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,240
to to choose like one

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,919
[Music]

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:54,319
uh one one thing or the other

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,280
you were able to see the directories

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,400
there

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,759
but actually you were unable to see any

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
of the

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,440
all the files there which was surprising

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,800
because like in the

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,720
in another or other uh like apps you

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,240
were able to browse the files or even

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,520
like when you tried to save us or

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,479
something like that

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,360
and it turned out that uh like uh in the

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,479
in the app

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,879
in the android app we are using some uh

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,280
some limitations of the of the of the

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,879
mime types of the files uh that you

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,440
are able to see and

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,360
from some reason i don't know why uh the

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,519
the android layer on the on the chrome

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,839
os is blocking that

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,919
so or there is some kind of a back weird

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,919
bug that like when you specify

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,000
uh the list of the of the mind types

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,839
that you actually like want to see

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,760
um then like no files actually appear at

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:53,279
all and you see only the directories

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,560
so what uh we have done is that we just

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,800
disabled this uh

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
this like selection or pre-selection of

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,160
the files

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,080
and uh like we asked the file picker to

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,240
just show us everything

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,440
so that was first step then the other

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,040
was that we

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,360
actually couldn't write to the google

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,480
drive like you are able to

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,880
open the files uh from google drive like

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,760
when you open the file picker for that

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,880
like you can see

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,519
the google drive there but

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,600
um then like when we when the user

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,800
actually tried to save something back

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,160
uh like it just failed like no error

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,560
message nothing it just

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,920
you know didn't save the file so uh so

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,360
we had to

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,800
or uh maybe it yeah actually it actually

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,519
uh has thrown an exception but

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,640
but that was it like exception and and

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
uh like yeah

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,680
no information like why it was failing

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,320
and everything

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,600
uh so it turned out like there are many

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
content providers

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,600
on the device which go like through the

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,600
through the android layer down to the uh

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,399
to the chrome os itself

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,200
and some of them like uh allow you to to

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,959
save on the

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,399
on the actual device and some of them

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,519
just you know

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,320
do not have the writing implemented uh

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,160
so like we had to switch like this

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,279
direct access to google drive to read

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
only

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,560
and the the my files which is like what

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,000
the new

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,760
the users like normally want usually

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,920
have actually the same problem on the

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,800
other hand the device has some

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,120
something that they call play files and

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,600
it is my art to the google drive as well

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,240
so

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,760
so the users are actually like

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,519
reasonably safe in this

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
in this area that like they do not lose

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,279
the files it is like

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,640
reasonably convenient for them uh

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,279
because like they have to use

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,800
uh see these different folders like if

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,519
they want to have like tweet

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,920
right excess but it is a limitation of

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,040
the

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
of the of the platform uh unfortunately

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,000
like

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
it is not much that we can do about that

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,480
uh

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,079
so yeah we have set it to read only

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,720
for this uh for this work then the next

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,519
thing

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,720
uh was platform enablement uh because as

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
i told you

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
uh like uh it was exciting to see uh

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,880
that actually

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,720
the collaboration office app like run

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,920
out of the box

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,600
but it was all emulated

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,640
so the chrome chromebook is usually like

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,680
a 64-bit um like

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,800
886 architecture but

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,519
itself the app itself was was provided

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,640
like under

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,880
under two abis and that was the arm

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:42,079
uh v7 and arm 64.

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,480
and uh like this is uh

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,160
uh this is uh done uh using some some

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,160
translation of the code

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,120
um they say that that like normally

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,839
uh like the safe safe choice for the for

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,880
the

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,440
for the code translation is the arm

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,800
and the arm64 like doesn't work on all

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,320
of the chromebooks

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,360
uh but you know we had both of these in

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,959
the in the play store

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,000
already uh but uh like it was limiting

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,480
the performance so

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,279
we wanted to do something something

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
better

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,240
uh so we thought like yeah so like the

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,320
device is

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,560
x8664 and i didn't uh

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,839
see in the small print somewhere on some

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,959
hidden page

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,040
that actually like the android

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,160
android layer that is on the on the

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,399
chrome os

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,320
is actually ax 86 not x86 64.

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,560
so like we have enabled all the building

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,760
for the x86 64.

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,320
um there are some you know things to

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
extend

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,839
and make sure it works and then

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,279
it was still not used so surprise like

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,639
we had to provide

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,959
to switch to x86 but then

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,639
um when we wanted to actually like

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:59,760
upload it to google play

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,079
uh it turned out that like when you

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,040
want to distribute something on the

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
google play

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,600
it is not that you only provide the

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,360
the 32-bit uh version of the application

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
but like for whatever application that

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
you have you have to provide the 64-bit

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,440
version as well

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,360
so actually like the initial like enable

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,600
event of the xd664 was not a lost time

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,440
uh because like uh when we wanted to

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,600
ship this x86

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,959
uh which is the only choice for the norm

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,079
os anyway

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,519
uh we had to provide the x8664 in

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,720
addition to that

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:40,720
anyway because of the google play

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,320
limitation so uh now like uh

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,480
when you when you want to install the

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,680
clover office from the

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,920
uh from the google play you have like

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,639
according to what what phone you have or

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
what

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,880
uh what what platform you have like you

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,920
will have choice from this uh

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,440
for for things and it will it uh you

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,639
will download the the right thing for

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:06,800
your platform like

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,800
arm arm 64 or x86 or x8664

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,959
then there were some life cycles uh

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,000
fixes necessary uh because like

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,079
previously

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,120
uh when you when you were running uh the

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,079
uh the the application

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,959
on the on the phone uh like it was

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:31,040
enough

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:33,519
uh that um that uh like

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,279
sorry it was written so that uh like it

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,920
wasn't actually too much tested

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,199
against uh against the the the complete

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
life cycle of the

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,360
you know of the application as it is uh

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,000
this is recommended like why

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,959
uh uh by google like how it should look

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,120
like so

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,880
so like this on creates on start on

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
resume before the activity is actually

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,519
running

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,040
and then like on pause on stop on

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,920
destroy and

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,079
uh so in the first implementation that

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,600
we had like on the on the phones

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:06,880
uh we were uh not uh destroying

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,880
uh correctly uh when we

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:13,760
uh when we like hit the the on destroy

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,399
uh the undestroyed face and it was

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,440
because

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,639
uh on the phones uh like uh it is

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,399
not that uh usual uh that you actually

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,040
like get to this on destroy phase um

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,440
because like you have to like explicitly

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,759
um

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
like swipe by the application and the

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
list of the apps or something like that

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,800
so

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,720
uh so like we didn't notice previously

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,320
that like when the on destroyer was hit

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,800
like directly from the uh

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,920
from the editing part of the application

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,279
uh that things

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,959
uh went wrong and the the stuff wasn't

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,519
saved actually

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,480
but uh on the chromebook it is it is

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,240
different because

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,360
like this like complete stop of the

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,839
stop of the activity uh

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,440
going through this on destroy uh is much

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,839
more usual use case

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,120
uh because it is triggered like when you

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,160
hit the close button

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,440
in the in the top right uh of the

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,279
of the window and so uh we noticed that

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,000
like uh when you are editing something

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,680
and just close the application directly

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,079
or close the window with the with the

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,639
app directly

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,519
like as you are as you are used to

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,240
normally

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,160
uh then the document wasn't saved which

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,880
was which was concerning so like we had

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,519
to do

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,560
uh a rethink of like how the life cycle

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,920
is supposed to look like and fix that

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,639
and related to that was that uh like we

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,560
had to

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,079
um call the save directly from the

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,480
native code uh

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,759
like ios was already doing that but not

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,600
the android app

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,519
uh because like previously we were

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,560
accounting on the javascript still

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,360
living so

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,440
uh so like it went from like the save

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,759
and from the javascript to native code

00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,440
and

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,360
it saved something went back to

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,959
javascript and then to java

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,000
uh that you know uh like uh copied the

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,439
stream actually

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,799
like from uh from uh to to the

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,520
device to some content provider uh but

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,480
like when you hit this disclose button

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,520
the web view

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,079
can be actually like that uh

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,959
by the time that the when you when you

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,000
try to

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,880
uh to perform this save and copy uh

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,080
to the actual content provider so we'll

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,640
have to fix that as well

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,880
then of course like there were lots of

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
user interface improvements

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,200
because the chromebook is actually a

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:45,360
laptop but when you normally

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,160
use the use the collabora office app

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,679
then like it is either on mobile on

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,400
tablet or on tablet

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,120
and like uh both these are different

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,320
because like

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:59,760
they are much more touch oriented

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,559
uh so like you have their like various

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,320
floating floating buttons that help you

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,760
like in the navigation on

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,919
or you know uh and other differences

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,400
that like they start in the read only

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,640
mode

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,400
and not in the editing mode and you have

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,120
to switch to that using this floating

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,600
button

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,799
and stuff like that but the chromebook

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,960
like really

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
looks and feels like a like normal

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,039
laptop

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,559
so even for the app like you want this

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,960
to be like more

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,240
more friendly to the users who actually

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,960
use that with the mouse

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,400
or to the users who use the trackpad uh

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,160
even though like lots of the

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,240
chromebooks have the touch uh

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
touchscreen as well so like you are able

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,400
to use the touchscreen

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,520
for the for controlling the app but uh

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,720
it's much more

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,679
usual that that you use some some

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:52,320
of these two like uh the the the

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,440
touchpad or the

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,880
uh or the uh or the mouse

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,080
and so for that like we default uh to

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,600
like our checks uh like what is the the

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,640
device form factor

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,600
uh we default to uh to desktop on the

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,160
chromebook

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,640
but in some cases like whenever it is

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,160
necessary to behave more like a tablet

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,720
uh we have uh like uh um introduce a

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
special

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,919
specialized schrodebook you know that uh

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,760
like helps in these situations like when

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:29,200
it it's not supposed to uh like

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,799
be exactly as a desktop um of course we

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
have hidden the sidebar

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,640
because the screen is actually smaller

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:38,559
than uh then on

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:41,600
normal desktop that you are using

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,120
uh we are not using the hammer too much

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,240
hammer js

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,720
is a is a framework that we use

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,679
for the support for the touchscreen uh

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,559
so we avoid that in most of the cases

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,600
and

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,720
like what was triggered by by this work

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,960
enablement was uh fixing of the

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,559
um floating button for the creating of

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,360
the new files it was

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,120
uh it was like from time to time missing

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,679
on the chromebooks like when you started

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,520
so

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,240
so there were some small fixes in this

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,240
area as well

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:20,400
and uh yeah as the last thing

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:23,600
we did there are smaller cleanups uh so

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,720
one of that was actually porting this uh

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,679
uh beautiful thing that uh that michael

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,360
mikhail beghorn uh has enabled in the

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,919
android builds and that was an

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,880
update uh to a new version of

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,240
photocophic

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,000
conflict because previously like it took

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:45,120
like extreme uh extremely a long time

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,960
uh to actually load the note of fonts uh

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,760
so due to that uh we weren't enabling

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
the

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,720
the noto fonts previously in the app

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,960
because otherwise the startup times

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,480
were just virtually horrible with that

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,559
like we had to limit that

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,960
uh to use only some of the internal

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,320
fonts that we have shipped with the

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:08,480
with the app itself but due to the

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,440
and unfortunately like i i'm not exactly

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,400
sure like who has

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,400
uh fixed this in font config um

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,480
would be great to credit them because it

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,600
was it was a big big leap

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,919
uh it was it was bugging uh backing me

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,720
for a long time uh like why this front

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,760
country

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,240
is uh taking so much time and like it

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,440
was it was hard to debug this so

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,000
so whoever did that info config like

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,600
he did or she did a great great job

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,039
there

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,679
and uh also the chrome os itself

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,880
doesn't have a native support for odf

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:49,200
mime types

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:52,400
so like when you actually have the

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,200
the file in the in the files app uh

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
which is the

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,880
which is the app that that like you you

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,080
use normally on

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
on either like android devices or on

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,720
chrome

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,919
chromebook for uh for navigation

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,159
between the files uh it was uh

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,240
it is missing so like we had to add a

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,720
hack into the intent filter

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,559
that basically like we check for the

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,360
dots

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,960
and check that things are ending with

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,000
with odd which is like

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,039
horrible but you know you can have many

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,919
dots in the file name so like

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,200
you have to uh you have to copy that

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,400
several times like with

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,240
with the amount of dots in there uh just

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,679
just for the case like the

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,919
the file that that you have there

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,520
has many dots in the name and then you

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,720
would still want to to default to

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,200
opening to

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:54,240
uh to the to the collar office there

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:57,440
so uh that is it for the enablement

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,480
um like after all these things uh

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,679
like it got to the state that that it

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:05,760
is uh usable uh you can use it for

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,320
editing your files on the chromebook

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
um it looks nice from my point of view

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,559
it behaves fine

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,200
um i've used this uh many times already

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,559
myself

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,520
so uh so of course like when i hit some

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,559
uh some corner cases i try to fix that

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,919
there are people

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,559
reporting reporting problems

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
from time to time on google play

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,120
directly

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,320
so slowly we are fixing them

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,679
like recently mert tumor has

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,840
has some improvements there and uh yes

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,600
in the first place big thanks to amd who

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,640
made this uh this break possible in the

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,919
first place

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:48,960
uh because they have they had uh that

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,000
they had funded uh this enablement work

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,950
there so that's

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,480
it from me

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,960
[Music]

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,960
i think

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:10,159
so i'll try to switch to jitsi

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:14,159
back and we'll check if you have

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,159
heard me or if i was speaking

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,840
to nobody so please do have any

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
questions

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,760
if not then thank you so much for

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,760
listening

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:49,760
oh so there were some something

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,760
yeah so somebody was uh

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,039
uh was wondering about this x86 yes

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,080
it was it was funny to find out uh maybe

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:03,120
they will switch to

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,120
64-bit at some stage i don't know but

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,760
but it is as it is

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:18,240
anything else as a question

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,200
i don't think there is anything so thank

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,960
you so much

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,799
and have a great rest of the conference

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:29,840
and great weekend
