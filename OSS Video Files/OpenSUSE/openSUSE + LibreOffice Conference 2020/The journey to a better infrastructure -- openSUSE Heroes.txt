00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,220
yes um

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,220
[Music]

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,639
he's the one with the slide deck

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
he says he's here

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,240
all right lcp hello yeah

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,240
all right at least we can hear you yeah

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,280
that's useful wait i have to

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,280
start this and that and

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:45,840
all right

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
all right

00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,480
all right wow all right here we go

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,480
we kind of did it yeah

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,159
so yeah let's

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,000
who are we we are the heroes and

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,200
that means we are structured time at

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,920
open susan which is a rarity

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,119
i think that's the hero the heroics in

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,200
itself

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,680
yes maintainers of the majority of opens

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
to the infrastructure which means

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,360
that we may not maintain the most

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,080
important parts of the infrastructure

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,720
but

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,720
we maintain the vast majority of it

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,560
and that means services

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,560
that that fall outside of the

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,079
jurisdiction of souza

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,439
itself we don't maintain build service

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,560
because that's that's what susa does and

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,479
we don't maintain

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,520
something else and i'm forgetting what

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,479
now that doesn't matter we maintain

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,200
most of the things that that fall under

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,520
open source

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
infrastructure umbrella we we don't

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,439
maintain

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,160
the build service and we do not maintain

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,720
the souza bugzilla oh yeah that i forgot

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
about

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,920
the bug zilla everybody forgets about

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,920
maxilla yeah

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:21,680
so this is a talk about

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,160
the future of of the infrastructure but

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,720
we

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,040
we should start probably from the uh

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
beginning so from the

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,800
uh what what we did what we did this

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,400
year

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,879
and this was quite kind of an eventful

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,959
year

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,840
for us because a bunch of things were

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,840
migrated from

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,800
from microfocus because of

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,000
that whole thing where microfocus

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,120
sold souza to somebody else uh

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,160
stasiek are you moving the slides i'm

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,200
now

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,239
so this is your interview

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,280
uh we magazine's newest planet is

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,040
searched to jekyll

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,200
which was a great thing because that

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,319
allowed us to

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,440
uh to

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,720
develop it on github which is a great

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,360
thing because that means that

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,080
we can collaborate on things much easier

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,040
and

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,040
don't have to rely on

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,440
rely on on one body of people who can

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,040
actually modify those things

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,799
we moved tsp from connect which is a

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,799
great thing because connect kind of

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,000
kind of is on its way out and

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,159
for those of you who don't know connect

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,599
it's the

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,599
uh basically the main part of

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,959
of the infrastructure we use for knowing

00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,000
who is who in the project outside of

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,640
open service and we

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,640
use it for

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,680
for gaining

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,680
memberships for for the contributors

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,519
and also some management related to that

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,880
to those memberships uh

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,720
then we also had that move from

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,320
mx from from the

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,199
main machines that were set up by souza

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,240
we moved those

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,120
to opensuse that

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,400
that is kind of important because that

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
allows us to

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,840
have a working postmaster address which

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,840
is a great thing i guess

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,339
and

00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,339
[Music]

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,560
and also forums were moved to the heroes

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,800
network

00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
and

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,080
that's cool because

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,759
we we really didn't have any insight

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,400
into those forums before we actually

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,400
migrated

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,680
so

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,440
so also uh the

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,919
thing that happened uh recently was

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
uh sousa community accounts were created

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
by souza

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,560
because of you know

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:41,120
uh microfocus no longer wanted to

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,240
maintain our

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,320
accounts maybe they wanted but but

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,320
it was better for us to actually move

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,840
over to

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,840
uh to

00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,319
because because that means that we can

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,440
actually uh have something that

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,800
is kind of maintained close by

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
not necessarily by us but but by by

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,000
people who

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,000
we have a better contact with

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:23,440
beyond that

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
beyond that we

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,240
had a whole bunch of things deployed

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,120
which

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,120
uh well

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,440
it's it's it's a great thing to

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,120
to have some some more software that we

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,120
can use as the project because

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,120
you know the heroes have to

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,039
support the the community of developers

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,759
that

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,800
that is uh that is the open source

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,759
community

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,000
and we do that by by having by

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,960
maintaining a whole bunch of

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
of those things among those were jutsu

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,080
meat which is useful for

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,120
for you know meetings like like this

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:12,319
uh model which

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,160
which i actually don't know

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,360
what we are hosting there right now

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,400
because i know

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,680
i know there are some i think

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,000
uh i believe the moodle is brand new

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,800
yeah the model is brand new it's it's

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,440
yes

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
it has it has some courses about some

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,479
things i don't know

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,160
exactly i think the idea is that um

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,400
there are some in members of the open

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,599
source community who are interested

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,240
in using moodle to help uh

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,759
fill out a portfolio of tutorials and

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,160
other kinds of things

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,960
to help people like on board into the

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,800
community

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,080
and to also be able to put in have a

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,520
place for

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,400
technical um learning material for open

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,520
souza

00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,000
people to host and put in there like

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,160
you know learning how to do some how to

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
deploy some service in opensuse or how

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,000
to do

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
using cubic or things like that so i

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,280
think that's where

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,520
moodle's going to come in although again

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,360
it is i think we just literally got it a

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,440
week or so ago so i don't

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,800
i don't know what we're gonna how how

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,840
it's gonna go

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,319
i think it was more than that but but

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,960
maybe i don't know it was announced last

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,280
week so

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,400
also not sure about that i know it was

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,520
mentioned in some

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,760
image saying because because that that

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,560
that's probably when i heard about it at

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,640
all

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,440
so yeah then then we have limeserv

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,560
survey uh deployed which is which was

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,560
already used for

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:49,839
for some surveys user server is used

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,320
to for knowing some some things about

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,830
our users we didn't before

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
matrix synapse which we use for

00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:59,440
[Music]

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
uh pretty much bridging pretty much

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
every

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,350
every part of our uh

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,480
chat infrastructure outside of

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,600
[Music]

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,279
outside of our own infrastructure the

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,480
the synapse node is not quite ready for

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:22,399
maybe maybe for usage for everybody but

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,720
but it's getting there i hope

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,160
and then there there is mayman 3 which

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,040
is not yet used but

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,240
it is deployed and it is being migrated

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,560
as we speak

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,160
it is literally running in in the

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,560
background

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,240
right now eating away at the soul of

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,760
stasia's laptop

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,040
yes well it's it's happening on the

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:47,760
vm so it's not doing much locally

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,800
but yeah it's it's happening and then

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,279
there were there were

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,480
there were there were updates to redmi

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,680
notepads

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,399
that were pretty much unmaintained for a

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,920
while

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,120
they kind of fell behind they had to be

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,040
updated

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,480
which finally happened this year which

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,680
is great news

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,399
because it's it's a real shame to have

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:13,200
any piece of infrastructure that that

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,200
falls behind

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,480
because of course that that's that is a

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
security issue and

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,760
and its functionality isn't there and

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,200
it's it's a shame to to have any piece

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:30,959
of infrastructure that falls behind

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,720
so there also was

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,920
um we also started the deprecating

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,279
all old machines that that were run

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,399
that are still running on uh

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,640
on order releases like uh

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,680
c11 c12 fedora 24.

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,079
that one hurts a little that one really

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,079
hurts

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,720
uh

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,000
that's i don't know this like five years

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,800
or something

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,519
it's no less than that it's it's a lot

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,320
of time

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,279
it's it's really it shouldn't it

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,640
shouldn't exist

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,360
it really should have been operated way

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,760
before that

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:22,240
and that's that's our free ipa machine

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:25,120
so that really really should be updated

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
we are we are planning on moving it to a

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,920
centos aid based system

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,519
it is in staging we're just trying to do

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
the data migration which is

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,279
complicated pretty much pretty much

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,079
everyone every single one of those

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,600
machines have

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,640
have a plan for migration it's just a

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,920
matter of actually implementing it it's

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,839
it's a kind of a lot of time to

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,839
to actually do everything

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,040
so this was the past

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,000
and hopefully it will it will be the

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,600
past in the

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,800
in the near future but

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,920
uh before us is at least the the great

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,399
great future of

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,120
actually working infrastructure which is

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,160
amazing

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,160
hopefully at some point

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,160
so many qualifiers stacia i i i feel

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
like we we're actually on a pretty good

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,000
path at this point we

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
we've got our our house in order in

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
terms of what applications and services

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,760
we want to offer

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,680
we're at this point almost entirely

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,839
operating off of salt based management

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,279
so we actually know what all of our

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,680
machines are

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,959
i i can say that many places cannot

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,560
claim the same

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,920
uh so if we know everything but we know

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,519
a lot a lot of things about

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,600
we know everything that we're supposed

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,079
to know yes

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:55,839
hopefully hopefully

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:57,519
uh so you should take credit for one

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,560
more thing that was not mentioned i

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,360
wrote it in the chat

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,320
so for red minded that i use quite

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,160
extensively

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,839
um you know we haven't had the test

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
instance before and suddenly

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,120
oh yeah that's true we now have staging

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,360
instances for

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,839
at least half of our applications so we

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,720
can actually play with it

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,120
yeah yeah that is useful

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,920
yeah i think um the pl all of our

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,600
applications

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,279
are eventually going to have staging

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,519
instances if not

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:36,959
by the end of this year by mid next year

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,880
so where is it yeah so like

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,560
we don't want to test and dev in

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,519
production because that's scary

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,519
and also stupid yeah

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,800
it kind of is so

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,680
so we had some requests we had some

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,760
requests

00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,519
not a lot of requests but we had some

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,560
requests to actually have a

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:02,639
git forge which would be useful for for

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,199
hosting some code

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,839
and some of them can't be hosted on

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,959
github

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,360
however you you you try it really it

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,720
really

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:16,880
wouldn't work out and

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,680
for those cases we actually do need

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
some infrastructure that could could be

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,600
a

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:27,760
good enough good for it for us to use

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,760
and we had some

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
forges let's say it was just sigit

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,880
listings

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,079
for four different uh

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,440
for different projects like kernel had

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,079
one and

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,560
i think there was something else that i

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,560
went pro

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,320
used to have one there was one there was

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,920
one

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,399
for um i think it was svn yes

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,399
oh you're right yeah that was svn uh

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,079
open qa i thought had one but that might

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,079
have also been scn it's it's a little

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,320
hard to remember all the different ones

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,680
that we have proceeded to kill over the

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,240
last year

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,199
yeah uh so the project that we chose for

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,240
this task

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,800
that that would be deployed today if i

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,600
didn't

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:23,519
if i wasn't uh working on mailing lists

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,720
uh is a pagor which i can't pronounce

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,839
apparently

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,399
you're doing fine i mean

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,120
i i think pierre is not going to like

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
twitch

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,000
when you say it also that that's a win

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,279
yeah uh which is a

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,519
python free based uh

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,720
git forge which which is a great thing

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,680
because i hope

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,480
everybody is able to at least somewhat

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,399
patch

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,680
um python 3 which is a bonus

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,079
for for any project uh the

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,720
the upstream is really responsive and i

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,519
know firsthand after contributing to it

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,000
very few times which is a shame i would

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,040
love to

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,720
contribute some more and i will have to

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,800
because there are some things i i have

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,639
to actually uh

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,639
add um we

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,560
we have us we have some similar use

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,759
cases to what

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,480
uh the current pogor instances are used

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,160
for

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:29,279
which is uh task management and

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,600
and using it as a as

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,560
a base for uh these git and

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,759
stuff like that it there are quite a few

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,320
things that

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,800
that just just work in our favor in case

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,600
of

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:48,800
uh in case of using the this this base

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,160
and the api is isn't

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:55,199
isn't stupid which is

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,160
i love how this is now a bullet point we

00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,160
need to have

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:04,400
the api isn't stupid yeah

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:07,120
especially about about git forges

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,720
which is which is kind of a shame but

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,600
but you would expect

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,240
git for just wouldn't be this this down

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,880
and also

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,520
integrates with with iron existing it's

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,439
existing

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,559
jenkins so we could use that for

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:26,160
ci question mark

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,919
hopefully right um and also because

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,480
packer supports a message bus

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,240
to emit messages on it uh when commits

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,559
and stuff like that happen we can wire

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,520
this

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,679
into the existing rabbitmq that exists

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,480
for opensuse infrastructure

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,160
and and other services can react to

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,960
events that happen

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,080
um on the packer instance the idea is

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
that

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,960
at least we're going to start for heroes

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,240
we're going to start with

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,880
our internal our salt repos and we're

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,039
going to

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,039
pull the project management related to

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,039
infra open suse heroes

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:06,320
into into packer out of redmine

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,000
to put it closer to the code and see and

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,559
and handle that and there's a couple of

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,520
other projects um

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,000
that are in the pipeline that are going

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,440
to

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,480
use packer as our uh

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,080
as our forge for supporting um some

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,919
interesting use cases

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,600
i believe there's some talks later in

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,200
this conference about uh

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,960
for example uh obs and git for example

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,320
so these are use cases we're thinking

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:39,120
about for

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,120
for packer in in opensuse infrastructure

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,480
so the next thing is account management

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,480
which

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:57,039
is kind of a topic

00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:01,120
in some sense connect is kind of

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:03,919
dead and uh stasiek hold on

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:07,120
um people other than me are saying in

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,559
the chat that the slides are not moving

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,360
huh apparently the future slide has been

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:15,440
showing up for

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,240
um five minutes oh i can see something

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,919
changed

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,960
hey now it changed what did you do

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,840
i i thought okay

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,679
you can't you you need to alt tab every

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,039
time you change slides

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,039
because i think we missed the last

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,080
couple of slides entirely

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,720
yeah all right so

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,480
uh i will i will i'll step back and yeah

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,200
can you just like quickly flash through

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
some of the

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,960
earlier slides just in case you know we

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,280
might have messed up

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,840
i can i can i'll tap back into

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:54,880
the app if it will allow me

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,880
nope that doesn't work

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:03,200
wow welcome

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,200
welcome to our world

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,600
huh that's interesting oh now it's whoa

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,600
whoa what happened

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,240
hey all right now we change again

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,760
okay and hopefully

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,080
all right whether you change the slide

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,039
does it change on screen

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,039
nope it does no

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:35,200
i love this this is a plus

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,960
oh yeah here we go all right so you got

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,280
the magic incantations

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,360
all right i don't know what they did uh

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,360
so

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,120
connect is dead that's that's a simple

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,320
thing to

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,360
to admit

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,919
we kind of have to get rid of it it's on

00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:02,320
a 11 i think

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:05,360
sp2 i think yeah it's a very old

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,440
11 server that we're all kind of worried

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:10,000
about

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,159
it also hosted some other things before

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,360
but those were kind of

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,559
moved because that's problematic

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,600
so we need a replacement of course uh

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,760
we need to look up what

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,799
what we do and what other others to

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,960
reach out to us

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:32,400
and how how to contact everyone else

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,000
and what group each every person

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:40,080
belongs to preferably we would like to

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,760
also tie this into one system that does

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:47,120
also the entire account management

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,200
because those things weren't

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,400
uh the same thing before the account

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,799
management and

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,480
user profiles well were two different

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,360
things and that's kind of problematic

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,400
because

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,880
suddenly you have to log in for

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:06,400
at least once to to the

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,640
to the user profiles

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,000
service to actually show up on the

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,799
service

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,440
and that kind of doesn't work too well

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,120
with

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,039
with uh just reaching out

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,720
to anybody you actually need to reach

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:24,400
out to

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,320
uh so we

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:32,799
kind of uh found

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:36,320
uh noggin not really found because it

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:40,000
it actually only started existing uh

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,760
like years after having been looking

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,880
for something it's

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,120
it is a fairly new python free based

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,120
again

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,960
user management solution based on free

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,039
ipa

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,200
which is great because heroes already

00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,360
use free ip for other other things and

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
mirroring those things together would be

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,039
a great thing

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,039
for maintainability just saying

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,400
it also uh shows you their profiles and

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,520
groups it's

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,480
it's fairly very good looking it's it's

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,000
surprisingly good looking for for a

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,880
piece of software

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
uh i i feel slightly i feel like this is

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,000
um

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
this is you being having low

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,159
expectations here

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,320
well i have seen other sisters

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,159
that's very they're not they can't all

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,280
be winners

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,480
they are mostly not winners uh

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,600
so the then

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,960
the system is very extensible because of

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,159
using the the free ipa

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,039
backhand and we can

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,919
very easily add some more things to it

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,120
because of

00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,400
how free ip works it allows for custom

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,520
fields it's

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,679
pretty good at being being

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,679
an ipa that's surprising

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,760
upstream is fairly active it's hard to

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,279
tell how it will look

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:18,159
in in months time or year's time

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,520
because currently it's actively being

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,880
developed it's

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,000
i don't think it's particularly uh

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,080
ready yet uh for prime time

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,679
uh even though it is ready for prime

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,440
time because it has to be

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,760
yeah i i like to kind of

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,760
the most important part about noggin

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:41,120
versus what we currently have which is

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,799
a mess um noggin

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,360
doesn't itself implement anything really

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,000
it is a front end for the existing free

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,919
ipa

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,880
server and provi and uses the free ipa

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,640
apis so that there's things like

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,919
self-service interactions for user

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,440
profiles

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,480
um group management uh things like of

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,679
that nature

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:08,159
so because of that the the actual

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,679
noggin application is fairly lightweight

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,320
and somewhat simple

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,960
compared to the to the actual back end

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,320
which

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:21,200
has a years of track record of being

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,279
actively maintained and and uh supported

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,799
so it's a lot less scary than than our

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,480
current situation

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:30,159
yeah especially since it's a fork of a

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,679
fork

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:37,039
of something that's just just a thing

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,840
it's it's not good it isn't

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,440
and the api is reasonable just because

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,480
it uses free rpa again

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:46,480
so so that's great and also it has a

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,760
fed message integration which is also

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,760
it also could be useful

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,159
so next we have switching slides oh

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,279
right all right

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,279
hey it worked this time

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,520
and opens to the forums and

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,520
opus of the forums is an interesting

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,960
case because we are still using

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,799
vibration 4

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,559
which is unmaintained and it is

00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:19,760
interpreter

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,880
and and it's a nightmare

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,080
and it kind of looks terrible so maybe

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,640
it would be the time to

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,799
switch it over to something else and i

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,039
also only have one bullet point because

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,919
really there isn't isn't much more

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,400
needed to

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,400
to explain why we would like to replace

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,919
it

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,960
so the solution to that is switching

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:45,440
slides

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:49,360
uh it showed up yeah i know

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,520
i i made sure it showed up uh it's

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,039
uh this course and this course may be

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,960
known to you because everybody is

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,279
switching to this course for some reason

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,360
i don't know why maybe because it's

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,039
modern and easy to use

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,919
maybe i don't know has a lot of plugins

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,880
and that

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,840
means that we actually wouldn't need to

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,440
implement anything

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,000
else because uh on one hand

00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,440
on the one hand we kind of already have

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
all the problems we need

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,240
and on the other i already implemented

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,760
some something that that may be useful

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,000
for us in their in the upstream so

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,120
that's that's very good and the upstream

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
is

00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,360
really active it's really hard to keep

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,039
up with with the development of this

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,960
course

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,120
because because of how how active the

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,279
upstream is

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,880
at least the churn isn't breaknecking

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,880
breakneck pace insane

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,000
it's it's still fairly reasonable in

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,039
terms of

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,279
their release cadence um and and

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,279
and code churn though yeah

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:59,360
that that means we

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,440
may be switching to discourage in the

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,039
near future which may be a little bit

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,000
hard because

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,799
the emails thing where i'm not really

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,559
sure how we are

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:13,520
going to perform this migration that's

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,000
that's that will be a little bit hard

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,440
let's

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:21,440
let's see how that goes all right

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,840
so opens to the mailing list uh

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,120
and opens to the mailing lists and

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,840
switching slides again

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:33,440
all right opens to the mailing list are

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,120
basically what you would expect from

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,799
mailing list which is

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,919
which is operated mostly with images and

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,840
commands in in shell which which is fine

00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,960
i guess

00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:49,760
but if we could have something better

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,559
maybe we would use it also the archives

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,279
are

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,840
really hard to look at sometimes and i

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,200
would

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,600
really love to switch to something else

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,640
and that means we are switching to mega

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,279
man 3

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,080
and or again switching slides all right

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,559
uh

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,440
and mega man 3 is really cool because it

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,480
allows us

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,200
hyper kitty which is mainly used hybrid

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,559
that

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,679
doesn't suck it actually

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,159
kind of looks like uh like forums which

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,200
is

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,480
a great thing because it's really a lot

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,520
a lot easier to to navigate than than

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,000
traditional mailing list archives and

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,799
also

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,039
includes features like actually uh

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,080
composing messages from the browser

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:40,159
instead of just using uh

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,120
email composing from the uh

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,760
browser requires login so of course that

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,159
means

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,399
you actually have to have some login but

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,440
it doesn't doesn't mean you have to have

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,399
uh you have to actually log into your

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,640
email to

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,679
post from there you just need to log

00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,919
into hyperkitty

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:04,559
uh it may be useful for people that that

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,559
are lazy

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,440
and also people that are very

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,760
very not used to using mailing this

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,240
and then there is stories which which is

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,919
also great because it allows us

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,200
maintenance of mailing lists and

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,200
moderation of mailing lists

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,919
from the browser and also from api

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:30,159
and from other things which is actually

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,200
really useful because that means

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,559
we don't have to go go

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,000
and log in to uh

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:44,240
the vpn to

00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,399
change anything and log in then to

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,960
to the machine and stuff like that we

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,039
just have to

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,279
you just have to log in in the browser

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,360
and and change things

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,600
and have them be active right away

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,120
it's it's just it's just a better

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,399
solution than one

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,399
than the the thing we have right now

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,440
and it's my migrating in the background

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,799
so i am seeing

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,399
the the things moving so it's good it's

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:17,519
it's gonna happen hopefully

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,720
uh in a week

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,760
or something i hope it's really just

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,480
saying that

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:28,880
that this is uh something that

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,399
will hopefully happen in a very near

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
future

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:35,440
considering that uh how slowly the

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,840
migration for the older

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:43,519
my name is goes it actually may need

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,799
when you require to be uh the next week

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,840
and not this week how i hoped

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,960
before it just

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,399
just life is i have to deal with with

00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:00,799
slow things all the time all right

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:04,399
and that's basically

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,799
all of us i think uh you you should join

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,080
us

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,799
because we are cool and and

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,600
we do cool things and also with your

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,080
help we could

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,640
you could do we could do more cool

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,840
things

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,440
like actually deploy

00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,440
pagor and and this cars

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,880
which would be great we didn't yet

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,840
because there wasn't time

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,240
but with more people of course that this

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,279
could

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,600
go a little bit faster

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,480
we are on three notes on matrix and

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,640
discard

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,240
and that may not fully work because

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,519
matrix is not bridge to freeno properly

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,120
so so that

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:52,240
that may be a little bit dicey but

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,440
there are a few people on matrix from

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,640
uh from open source heroes so

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,440
still that that probably would work

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,440
to some degree

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,799
at least i'll be there and and stasic

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,679
will be there

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,080
i know i think there are a few more

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,600
people

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:16,720
here or matrix too but yeah and

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,279
and that's a thank you card and i

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,760
welcome

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,840
any questions that that may be coming

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,080
this way

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,679
um i have one sure actually i have two

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,720
well all the questions so

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,720
with the uh

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:39,120
tsp you mentioned moving from connect

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:40,480
um i recently looked we haven't

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,799
obviously since coveted we

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,880
haven't really needed needed so much but

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,720
i recently looked into it and

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,159
found out that i don't no longer have

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,600
access to

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,360
uh grant tsp um requests

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,279
and and i i don't think that anyone has

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,840
been able to

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,200
put anything in since the update i i i

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,080
emailed encore about it so we're

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,880
actually

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,519
uh he said he'd take a look at it later

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,760
but

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
i figured it was probably the migration

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,720
that had something to do with it

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,879
yeah but it might have had

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,839
some yeah the database was

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,720
duplicated yeah yeah that shouldn't be

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,280
much of an

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,079
issue but they're not getting updated

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,599
anymore

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,919
it's kind of it's so at this point i

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,679
think um

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,679
if i remember how this thing actually

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,399
works uh so tsp

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,440
used to just yank account data straight

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,800
out of connect

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,320
um and now the connect is

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,679
more or less gone um it's not really in

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,839
use uh tsp doesn't have anywhere to get

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,839
new account information so at this point

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,679
it's

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,480
um semi-non-functional

00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,079
i guess we can count kind of stars that

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
we didn't need it this year but

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,760
um probably needs to be fixed before we

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,119
you know go back to the whole well we're

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,040
traveling for conferences again

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,720
maybe that will happen at some point i

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,040
think uh that's

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,480
actually i should look at it because

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,760
yeah i did i just had the whole

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,079
migration so

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
because because we kind of wanted to do

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,560
this quickly

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,400
because well we needed to kill off

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,440
connect very quickly

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,960
well connect citizen dead

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,800
i know i know i said we wanted to i

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,079
didn't say we did

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,119
yeah that was back when we we were more

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,240
hopeful about

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,680
connect being being dead

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,280
yeah yeah

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,960
so so angkwa definitely like

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,320
when when you have the opportunity to

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,599
take a look at it angular is a good

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,839
person to

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,200
sure probably go through it with you

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,839
just the idea how that whole thing was

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
set up

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:54,000
but the other thing was the other

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,160
question i had was um

00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,599
with um

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,520
with the open source event manager i

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,119
know that hannah i always contact hannah

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,160
when i need something updated with the

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,280
system

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,960
um because it tends he tends to have

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,760
some issues but you know he he meant

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,400
he says that he knows it um so i don't

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,839
know how we

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,680
how we can solve it it's always

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,760
difficult to on an upgrade

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,800
because when you upgrade introduces some

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,480
bugs and

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,240
one more in the middle of like a call

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,200
for papers or something like that which

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,400
is

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,119
somewhat constant um you know you end up

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,480
with some

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,280
some very difficult situations that

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,960
that you can't really do much with but

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,280
do you guys have any oversight on that

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,520
or

00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,119
have you looked at that at all so

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,720
unfortunately osem is

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,440
not part of the hero set of applications

00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,640
i believe that it is it is maintained uh

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,520
kind of

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,560
it isn't maintained and sold so it's

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,599
kind of harder

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,520
for us to tell actually how this

00:36:55,599 --> 00:37:01,359
is done uh yeah

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,800
i i was under the impression we didn't

00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:05,280
actually maintain it because

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,000
it is it is listed on on the machines so

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,119
it is

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,359
it is okay so we have access to it yeah

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,440
it is in the network so uh

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,960
yeah well so much for saying that i know

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,240
all the we know all the machines that we

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,960
have because

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:22,800
because that's clearly not true yeah

00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:25,760
this is this is actually

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,200
uh yeah this is this is kind of uh kind

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:30,079
of a shame because

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,280
there are some machines that actually

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,760
should probably be

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,839
maintained uh together with with

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,839
everything else

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,440
but due to some circumstances

00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:43,440
they just aren't and i think

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,560
i think in time we kind of have to take

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,839
a look at it and

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,960
and actually fix that i i think that'll

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:51,359
actually improve as

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,200
you know we talked about earlier about

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:56,560
having the packer instance

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,839
and moving the salt uh salt states

00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,400
to to the packer system i think once we

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:02,960
do that

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,880
and essentially democratize the access

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,960
to contribute to the

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,240
to the repo um it'll be a lot easier for

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,599
people to pitch in

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,280
or at least kind of figure out how to

00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,119
get started and

00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,079
and make that and feel more a part of

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,079
the

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,240
of the underpinnings of opensuse because

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,320
our infrastructure is

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,280
is king for us it's what makes the

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:33,839
project works

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,839
as well as it does

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,680
okay thank you um that was just my

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,400
questions if anyone else has

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,119
anything yeah anyone else has got

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,839
questions

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,839
we're here to answer them

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,200
or we can just look at lcp's list of

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,040
emails that he's importing

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,280
which is probably not what he intended

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,280
to do

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,599
maybe oh richard yeah what's up

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,640
why don't why are we hosting so much of

00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,839
our own services

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,800
and not either getting other companies

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,680
to host it for us or sponsor us for it

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,240
or

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,359
you know why yeah or cloud providers all

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,440
that kind of stuff why

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,960
why are we sort of stuck in this

00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:21,200
old-fashioned thing of you know our own

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,880
little network behind our own vpn

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,000
and doing things that way

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:31,119
considering that our experience with

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:35,119
outsourcing some hosting uh

00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:38,480
here examples like paste or

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,040
i don't know what else what else do

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,320
well i mean up until about you know

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,760
three or four months ago

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:49,359
the forums was outsourced yes uh as

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,520
was the account system and

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,440
uh exactly and that's kind of my point

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,119
is you know three or four months ago

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,480
my camera disappeared three or four

00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,040
months ago we were saying

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,880
you know help we need more people we've

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,640
got too much work

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,079
you know the heroes are too busy we

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,560
can't have a hard we have a hard time

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,040
maintaining everything we've got

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,440
and then since then we've added more

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,800
things that the heroes are maintaining

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,160
and it's really cool that you guys are

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,359
doing it and you're enthusiastic but

00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,560
it's like i'm just kind of looking at

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,480
this from a

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,119
sustainability point of view you know

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,839
sure but a bus hits the two of you

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,880
and like you say the project you know

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,960
everything is

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,560
um you know our infra is everything that

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,079
makes open season special so you know a

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,040
bus hits the two of you and opens

00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,079
through the stops

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,560
kind of scares me so

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,280
yeah that's that's fair so we live very

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,079
far apart

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,640
to be fair so yeah if a bus hits both of

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,440
us

00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,000
in this particular diamond era i'd be a

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,880
very

00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,960
i'd be very impressed but uh if

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,160
especially if it's the same bus

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,680
[Music]

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,359
but um it's a fair question richard um

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,880
so some of the um multiple services that

00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,839
we have that we're that we're bringing

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,800
online today

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,000
are actually intended to consolidate or

00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,839
eliminate

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,280
duplicate services that we currently

00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,400
have in service

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,440
so for example um we have three or four

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,040
instances of random code repo hosting

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,520
in opensuse today that serve no valuable

00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,040
uh reason to be duplicates so

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,920
consolidating that on the packer

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,319
instance

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,040
and the end state is that we're going to

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,880
migrate

00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,319
all the data out of red mine and into

00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,720
packer so we will

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:33,119
eliminate about four services in the

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,280
context of moving to packer

00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,000
the mailman's the mailing list service

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,200
is considered fundamentally critical

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,640
and so this is about a upgrade of that

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,240
existing infrastructure

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,920
from one that is actually broken and

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,520
cannot be maintained

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,280
so the current mailing list software

00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,079
just doesn't work we can't really move

00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,599
it forward

00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,920
so that's why we're making this change

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,359
now um the

00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:01,280
matrix stuff is mostly

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,359
because it is currently impossible

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,400
to without matrix it's currently

00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,880
impossible

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,160
to have all the project members

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,960
everywhere being able to communicate

00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,880
with each other

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,720
so the idea is to break down silos so

00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:16,000
that added services

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,520
we feel is worth it given that it helps

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,960
you know improve the communication

00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:22,720
across across the project but in general

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,800
our plan with these new services so like

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,560
noggin is actually decoming three

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,880
services when we when we switch over to

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,640
it

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,160
we are getting rid of connect we are

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,000
going to get rid of

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,760
um some of the other weird stuff that we

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,560
have right now for

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,359
for account identity and infrastructure

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,079
we're gonna

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,960
and consolidate all of that so the goal

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,599
is

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,800
we want to have a coherent set of

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,520
services

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,599
that support the entire project and

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,119
where it makes sense

00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,640
we continue to maintain and where it

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,280
doesn't we can

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,880
we can look at other options like so the

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,119
open sousa forums

00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,720
i think the only reason we're currently

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,359
planning on continuing to host it

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:04,000
is because nobody wants to do the work

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,280
nobody

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,480
externally like uh i've informally

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,000
done a couple of asks about it nobody

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,520
wants to do the data migration

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,440
because apparently it's too weird and

00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,040
too hard so

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,040
and we don't really want to lose i think

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,480
what's almost 20 years

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,839
worth of data so we're doing them we're

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,960
going to be doing the data migration

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:27,200
ourselves and we'll be

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,960
at least for the short to medium term

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,359
hosting discourse ourselves

00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,800
in the future it may be we decide to

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,800
migrate it to

00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,720
you know we we set up an arrangement

00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,760
with discourse the business

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,400
and and we migrate the data down to that

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,920
path

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,359
we will still have the federated

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,440
identity service and stuff like that

00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,359
that'd be a similar arrangement to what

00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,079
for example the fedora project does for

00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:52,079
their discourse instances

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,359
but since we already have to maintain a

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,599
forum

00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,280
we might as well maintain put something

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,440
that we can actually maintain rather

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,079
than something that's basically broken

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,200
um so it's a fair question hopefully

00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,839
that answers it

00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,839
um you know it does

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
thanks

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,800
but yeah like fundamentally we're not

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,040
the goal is to not add

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,480
a ridiculous number of extra services um

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,480
in by and large we're actually i think

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,839
on a net basis going to reduce

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,839
the number of services we are

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,440
maintaining as part of heroes but we are

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,200
also going to increase

00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,960
the number of services that are managed

00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,280
through um

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,599
through something that basically anyone

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,920
can participate in so the salt repo

00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,800
will actually know how to set up all of

00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,040
our services

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,079
or we're going to have like some kind of

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,480
if we ever have

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:46,079
a kubernetes or something like that then

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,839
we will do it that way

00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,079
um so right now we're working with what

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:51,920
we have with which is right now

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,440
a bunch of virtual machines and assault

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,520
men and assault repo

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,880
and so we're we're configuring with salt

00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,480
and provisioning it that way

00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,480
but because everything is managed in

00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,920
salt and we have all these descriptions

00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,119
set up correctly

00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,119
um hopefully uh it means that if

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,119
stasik and i were managed to be hit by a

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,319
magic bus that could cross continents in

00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,240
the same day

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:14,720
um then the project will survive because

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,480
there

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,160
will there will be knowledge they'll be

00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,079
maintained services there will be

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,480
configuration descriptions

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,640
and all of the projects we're using have

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,000
have reasonably strong communities

00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,119
so there will be people who can help

00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:36,400
so that's that's sort of uh the

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:36,400
the goal here cool glad to hear it

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,160
thank you for the questions richard

00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:50,079
anyone else well actually i have a bonus

00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:54,240
on suffolk richard

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:57,280
so experience with mfit shows that it's

00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,319
easier and faster to do things yourself

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,400
so might sound funny but and

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:04,000
i mean not to be blunt but that is

00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,560
totally and utterly

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,400
pointlessly irrelevant because mfit have

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,200
no relationship with susa

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,000
in any way man or form now so thanks for

00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,280
the data point

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:18,160
but it's a different world now

00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:19,280
yeah and while it is true our previous

00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:22,400
experiences have

00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,839
to put it nicely sucked um that doesn't

00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,319
change the fact that

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,680
in the future we could have positive

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,000
relationships

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,640
with opportunities to work with you know

00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,680
companies that do open source project

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:39,040
services

00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,240
i am not completely opposed

00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:45,280
to the idea of giving discourse money

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,319
to run discourse uh

00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:49,440
if it makes sense and if we can have a

00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:52,960
reasonable

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:56,720
sla around it that's fine

00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,640
um i am not sure they could

00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,400
provide said reasonable sla but my

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,000
experiences so far seeing it in fedora

00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,720
have been okay

00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,359
um but again it's something worth

00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,119
evaluating in the future i want us to be

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:10,640
and i believe i think stasia would agree

00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,359
with me here i think we want to be in a

00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:14,880
good place

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,880
to make those those um decisions

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,400
before we start you know making those

00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,839
decisions with without the

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,839
full ability to implement them

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,160
yeah i would agree

00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:39,440
someone is asking uh serendi

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:43,599
how can i help so uh stacia do you wanna

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:46,880
answer that question well

00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:49,760
there are a lot of ways to help and that

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:50,480
of course includes the the basic things

00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,720
that that's

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,240
related to all of our infrastructure so

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,880
translations and

00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:59,520
and development of different websites

00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:02,000
which is done on mostly on github

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:03,599
uh there are quite quite a few of

00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,839
repositories

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,640
i don't know depending on what what your

00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,680
interest is

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,599
i i could probably link you something

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:16,880
something uh most more specific but

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:18,839
the the bulk of of the work that is

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,800
currently done is

00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:26,720
in uh immigrations which is

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,800
really hard to actually pawn off

00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,920
yeah we it's actually quite hard to

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,880
divvy up work for

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,480
for migrations because some of it also

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:37,760
winds up being a little

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,960
um uh uh

00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,880
complicated and and and granting

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,400
the the most challenging part of this is

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,839
the part i want to fix once we have our

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,280
packer instance online

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,680
the most challenging part is the

00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,599
catch-22 of you need to be trusted

00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,440
to have internal infrastructure access

00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,440
before you can start contributing

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,640
there is actually no reason for that to

00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,480
be a requirement

00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,760
in fedora infrastructure for example

00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,839
that is not a requirement

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,440
i have contributed and helped support in

00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,680
fedor infrastructure projects

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,800
without ever having root access to any

00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,119
infrastructure

00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,240
and that's something and that that sun

00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,930
well

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:14,839
and that's something

00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:16,640
[Laughter]

00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,359
richard

00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,200
no they trust me fine it's just uh i i

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,000
haven't actually asked for it i haven't

00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,240
needed it

00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,800
um but i want us to be in a position

00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,040
where we can have the same flexibility

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,839
uh i want the opportunity for anybody

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,880
any geeko

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:35,040
in the community to help

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,680
with our infrastructure because it is

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,240
what helps make our project great

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,960
and you know the good the services we

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,800
offer

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:44,880
are the services that power the

00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,400
contribution and so we want to make sure

00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,319
that that is also

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,760
as accessible to contribution so

00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,839
that's sort of at least my personal

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,800
vision some of those services that we

00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,000
mentioned also

00:49:54,800 --> 00:50:02,720
don't have any and

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:07,839
uh salt configurations written

00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:09,520
for them yet so that can also be helpful

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:11,200
yeah once we have a public salt repo we

00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,000
could actually add a list of tasks and

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,440
say hey if you

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,920
guys have salt interest if you have salt

00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,440
experience you could give a shot at like

00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,720
helping us write these

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,040
these salt states so that we can

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,040
actually like manage them

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,359
and then we can figure out how to do

00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,040
like since we now have staging and dev

00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,640
infrastructure for everything

00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,079
we can run them on there and see if they

00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,680
break everything

00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,680
without actually breaking production

00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,160
uh you've always testing in production

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,680
it's the only real way to do anything

00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,000
richard yeah i mean that's sort of fair

00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,800
but

00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:55,839
like i i i'd like to at least have pull

00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:55,839
requests not run on production

00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,839
any other questions from folks

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,040
well i want to thank you all i mean i

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,240
actually i didn't hear any of what

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,200
richard said i just listened to the

00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,520
answer but

00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,400
um i assume no one else's answer asked

00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,400
any more questions

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,960
well i mean you're welcome and richard

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,160
just asked why are we

00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,559
why are we doing this more or less

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,200
okay well i'll let you answer that and

00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,400
i'll just

00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,640
mute oh no no i already answered it i

00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,760
i said that basically we're doing this

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,760
because we want to

00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,760
simplify our infrastructure to

00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,040
accelerate contributions

00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,280
uh and and you know advance the

00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,800
sousa community i i tried so hard to do

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,240
the weird souza

00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,240
tagline thing but i forgot the third

00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,119
word so i i screwed up i'm sorry

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,160
but but the whole point is that we want

00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,200
to we want to make

00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,480
it a better experience for opensuse

00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,520
contributors

00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:09,119
to it to work in the project and so that

00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,240
everyone can enjoy being part of the

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,760
community

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,760
that's that's the real goal

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,079
cool well thank you and we appreciate we

00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:25,680
appreciate everything you guys are doing

00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:26,079
um so it looks like we probably have a

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,280
break

00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:32,559
for another um hour

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,040
roughly wow that's nice yeah

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,000
at least at least in this room i mean

00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,000
there's other rooms in

00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,200
in uh there's other talks happening in

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,800
room one

00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:47,839
um so

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,839
the next talk that'll take place is uh

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,160

00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,359
that'll take place in this room and of

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,040
