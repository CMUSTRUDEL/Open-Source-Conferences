okay everybody

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,840
i hope you can hear me well um this is

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,280
my talk on public money public code

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,600
global problems need global solutions

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,359
and in the next 30 minutes i will tell

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,720
you a bit about our public money public

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,640
code campaign

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,240
and also what happened during the corona

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,199
crisis and wi-fi software as a good

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,880
solution

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,920
in order to tackle this crisis when it

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,359
comes to software or technical solutions

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,320
so first of all the free software

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,399
foundation europe

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
is a charity that empowers users to

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,640
control technologies

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,719
and among these users are not just us or

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,280
companies but also governments public

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
bodies

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,000
and so on and so we will focus in the

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,960
next 30 minutes on

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
um public bodies and how they and how

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,360
shall they use

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,280
free software so let me start with this

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,600
comic so i guess you are all familiar

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,239
with the us nuclear chain of command

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,520
so there's a president and the secretary

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,039
of defense and so on

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,280
and you all know there is this red

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,400
button but the question always

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,080
is who installed the red button and what

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,240
does the red button do

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,680
and so therefore we need transparency in

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,680
order to see if the

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,000
chain of command is followed if the laws

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,200
are followed and if the red button

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,479
is going to do what it shall do and so

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,400
therefore it's not just about

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
transparency but this is the first

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,119
um a very important thing but there are

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,920
four freedoms of free software

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
um and i will tell you in the next 30

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,799
minutes also

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,040
why these four freedoms are especially

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,520
important when it comes to

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,520
government actions so the first freedom

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,840
of free software is to use it

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
then you can study it you can share it

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,520
and you can improve it

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,240
this means you can use the software for

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,079
any purpose without any restrictions

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
you can study the code as it is

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,960
transparent so it can be analyzed by

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,560
anyone so this is the red button case

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,360
you can share it with others

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,200
so without any limitations and also the

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,439
price doesn't matter so the free in free

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,920
software doesn't come from free beer

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,000
but it's about these four freedoms and

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
also you are free to improve or modify

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,840
the software so you can

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
adapt it to your needs and also you are

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,840
free to give it back to the community

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,879
and and so therefore whenever we have

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,840
these four freedoms

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,000
then it is free software and it is very

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,280
important to have free software in place

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,040
in order to take a crisis so why should

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,560
you support free software but also why

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,959
should especially governments

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,360
support free software so first of all

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,280
it's about digital serenity

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,440
so in order to establish trustworthy

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,440
system public bodies must ensure they

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,000
have the full control over the software

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,640
and the computer systems they are using

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,360
this is a very important and the key

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
point

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,640
and also another main argument is that

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,160
public bodies are financed through taxes

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,959
so they must make sure they spend the

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,440
funds in the most efficient way possible

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
and these both things can guarantee by

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,360
the use of

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,879
free software so it becomes a bit

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,920
clearer if you compare it to

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,239
proprietary software or property

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,239
um

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,200
solutions on the market so first of all

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
you have a problem with the indoor

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,840
availability so

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,319
um it's um a problem to have proprietary

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,239
solutions um which can be connected to

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,000
each other where you can share data

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,400
documents and so on and so normally

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,200
um you end up in a window login which

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,080
means

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,239
um you have to choose um from the bunch

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
of software from one window

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,000
and you can only have this under

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,599
operability guaranteed if you are

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
using the systems of this window also

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,959
when it comes for example to updates or

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,760
maintenance

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,760
or um things like this you always have

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,439
to come back to this banner in order to

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,159
make sure that your software is up to

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,640
date or

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,640
even if you want to adapt something if

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,480
you want to modify something then you

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,200
always have to go back to this one

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,000
window and ask him to do something and

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,640
this comes with

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
unpredictable costs uh for the future

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
because

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,560
um this one window then um yeah can make

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,959
the price for you or

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,479
at least he will make the price um more

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,639
or less as hebish

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,240
and so therefore this comes with

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,160
unpredictable costs for you in the

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,000
future so this webinar login

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,759
is a major issue when it comes to

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,919
property software

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,000
also especially as we've seen during the

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,199
corona crisis there's a low acceptance

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,360
by citizens

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,080
when it comes to closed source property

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,680
solutions or software

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,479
and if you have a look at this all you

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
have to pay

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,280
for licenses so um to use the software

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
you have to pay a license fee and this

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
is

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,320
this investment is completely lost um

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,479
once you are

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,240
using property software so you can't

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,720
take the money in order to for example

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,440
modify your software by your own

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,919
and also there are some security issues

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,960
um

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,560
so it's a bit harder to look in the code

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,520
of the property software and so

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,720
therefore to find

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,639
bugs or backdoors for example and so

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,400
free software here also those solutions

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,360
so and if we compare it to

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,639
free software all these points here then

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
we see that we have

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,120
the interoperability by default due to

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,840
open standards so it's very easy to

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,919
share data and information between three

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
software solutions

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,680
and also you have the independence with

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,919
rely sensors so you have these four

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,320
freedoms for example to

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,960
adapt the software to your needs to have

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
tailored

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,560
software which fits to your needs and

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
also to

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,880
modify it later on and to share with

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,840
others so all the four freedoms are just

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
mentioned

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,440
and also this gives you the possibility

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,880
to collaborate together

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,560
and thus share risks and costs so

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,240
for example especially when it comes to

00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,400
public administrations

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,479
the demands are more or less equal so um

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,080
and therefore it makes a lot of sense to

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,560
collaborate here and

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
to work on a common software solution

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,319
for example

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
and also it's transparent by default as

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,360
i just said

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,280
around the four freedoms and though

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,600
therefore also the acceptance

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,600
by the citizens is guaranteed and

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
everybody can see what a code does what

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,960
the red button does

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
and so therefore this is also a pretty

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,720
good idea

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,400
and what we've seen on the market is

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,600
that there's a strong involvement of

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
local partners

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,319
when public bodies are procuring free

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
software

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,360
i have some figures here for you as well

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,520
in the next slide

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
and you have this transparent code so

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,680
this makes it

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,639
easier to check for bug bugs or

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,880
backdoors or any any um or similar

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,039
things so um you can more easily

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,000
and make sure that your software is

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,319
secure

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,440
in general free software isn't secure by

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,800
default but

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:04,240
you have the chance to modify the code

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,319
easily and therefore for example

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
around bugs and stuff like this so if

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
you compare it

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,639
it's a very good idea to use free

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,639
software

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,319
and especially when it comes to

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,400
government's public bodies

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,880
it becomes very clear that there are

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,360
good arguments to do so

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,360
and as i just mentioned let's have a

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,400
quick look on the market so

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,400
um for now governments are amongst the

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
largest purchasers of

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,759
i.t goods and services and comprise up

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,080
to 27

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,280
of the revenue of software firms so this

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,360
means normally

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,960
they are a strong a key player on the

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
market

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,039
but to be honest they are not so they

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,000
are all fragmented they are procuring

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,599
for their own they

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
are doing or looking for their own

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,400
solutions and so on

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,160
and therefore um these 27 percent

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,479
might look like a huge player on the

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,360
market but at the moment they are not a

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,280
key player

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,000
it's just like they're buying buying

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,400
buying paying for licenses and so on

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,319
so imagine what would happen if the

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
governments or public bodies are

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,840
investing

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,199
this budget into free software i guess

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,800
our work would look

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,360
a bit different now and when we see

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
or when we have a look at um regulations

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,800
happening

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,759
for example um here at the example of

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,400
france

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,800
we see that it's also good for economy

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,360
to

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
switch to free software so we see in

00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,960
france that there is a

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,560
let's say a free software friendly

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,360
regulation in place

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,200
and this already led to the fact that

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
there is an increase in companies that

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,479
use free software

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,000
there's an increase of number of iq

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,039
related startups there's

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,880
an increase of employees

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,480
that's that's for sure and also what's

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,120
very very important is

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,880
that there is a yearly decrease in

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,120
software related patterns

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,040
and so you can see if you are starting

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,959
to work on this and if you have

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,399
um or if you're starting to work on your

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,240
regulation and if you

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,080
are going more into the direction of

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,600
free software then it

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,640
also helps um directly your local market

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,040
we also see this with barcelona so they

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,440
are also collaborating with other cities

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,720
and they have they have some rules and

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,839
they're kind of strict

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,880
in the in the national um field that

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,360
they say

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,279
70 of the software budget have to be

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,760
invested in free software

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,200
and this led to the fact that from 3 000

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,920
companies

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
they worked with in the last year 60 of

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,519
them

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,600
have been as an ease so you can see it's

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,160
good for your local market and it's good

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,800
for small and medium enterprises

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,600
and your invest investments are not any

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,760
more lost

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,920
for licenses but you can also foster

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,200
your local iq market

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,800
so to sum up

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
for governments it's important to use

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,000
free software because

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,560
they have strong partners in their

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,760
region especially smes small and medium

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,120
enterprises

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,920
they are um able to have a

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,040
tailored software that suits their seats

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,279
their needs

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,320
and not a windows business model that so

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
they are free

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
to have a software which is exactly done

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,600
for them

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,480
and also with the transparent process

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,120
you don't have to

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,120
reinvent the wheel again and again so

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,079
you can share expertise you can share

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,200
costs and also

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,920
you can use um what others have already

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,160
done

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,440
so and this is a very important point

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,519
that you don't have to reinvent the

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
wheel especially when it comes to

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,160
international and cross-border

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,399
cooperation during a crisis

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,959
so what we've seen during the corona

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,519
crisis is that there is a global problem

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,800
and that we need global solutions

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,160
because

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,800
this crisis is globally cross borders

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
and therefore we have to work together

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,120
across borders

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,320
so the global crisis comes when it comes

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,360
to software demands

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,640
with very similar demands so for sure

00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,600
it's not everywhere in the world the

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,120
same

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,000
but the solutions which we have been

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,519
looking for are more or less similar and

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,959
the demands and needs are

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,640
um yeah similar so there's a specific

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,160
need for hardware and a specific need

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,760
for software

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,839
and just for a few examples

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,680
you also figured out i guess this is

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
solutions for home office or remote

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,480
working like

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
also video conferencing tools and so on

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,120
and also

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,120
this is what's very important the debate

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,160
around tracing apps or the

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,160
there is still a debate and um yeah so

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,320
this debate showed us that it's very

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,399
important to have free software

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,560
and the global solution for this is that

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
we need this interoperability

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,920
due to open standards because we need to

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,800
work together across

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,040
borders we need a free licenses in order

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,920
to make sure that we can share software

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
especially

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,240
also with countries who are not having

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,600
the resources to develop software at the

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,760
moment for example

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,160
but they desperately need this software

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,399
so why not just sharing it with others

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,760
um but um yeah so that's a that's a good

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,680
thing to do so and also what we've seen

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,839
in many cases that there's also a

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,839
collaboration across borders and thus

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,839
you can foster innovation which is also

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,720
very important to have a fast solution

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,040
in place

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
uh which can be then also modified by

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,440
others

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,839
across borders you have the acceptance

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,959
um

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,360
due to the transparency um we will

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,200
especially around the tracings apps we

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,160
have seen that transparency is a major

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,079
argument

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,399
in order to convince people to use these

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,959
apps and also you can involve

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,720
all stakeholders which are somehow

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
working on this this doesn't mean that

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
there's

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,639
need only be they have that this only

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
have to be coders

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,320
and there are so many stakeholders with

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,399
so many knowledge around

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,440
and so therefore it's a it's a good

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,880
solution um

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,480
to have um free software um in place in

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,480
order to make sure that everybody can

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,720
work on a good solution

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,040
and so let's have a look at the concrete

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,000
example of these tracing apps and

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,079
um how the debate uh was running so in

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,519
the very beginning of this

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,120
debate we stepped in um and reached out

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,000
to decision makers and said there are

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,240
three demands from

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
our side for these apps so first of all

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,800
they have to be used

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,000
voluntarily they have to respect

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,839
fundamental rights

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,519
and they have to be free software and

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,760
so that's why um

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,800
with these three demands we entered the

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,920
debate

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,920
and um yeah our arguments were well

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,959
received so for example the world health

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,240
organization

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,440
followed in may 2020 hour demand

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,240
and released the jam some

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,800
some considerations and said that if

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,199
there are

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,639
these apps in place these tracings apps

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,639
then they have to be

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,320
fully transparent and also they have to

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:07,120
be open source

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:09,680
and so also within the european union

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,560
they followed our our demand so within

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,160
the ehealth network which is a

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,839
network of member states and the

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,160
european commission they released

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,880
these common toolbox for member states

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,880
and

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,480
set some recommendations on how these

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,160
apps should look like

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,839
and there the european commission

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,240
together with the member states said

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,560
that the apps have to be published

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,720
and transparent in order and this is

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,720
very important to make sure

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,639
that they can be reused that there is

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,639
this interoperability

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,000
and also they made a point about

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,279
security as the code

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,680
is transparent and so um

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,199
this was a major thing for us that the

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
european commission also not just

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,760
followed us on the

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,839
um point of transparency but also into

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,880
our

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,160
the reuse factor and also

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,040
the security arguments and

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,160
what happened afterwards is that many

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,120
countries

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,079
release their apps as free software and

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,839
there is for example

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,519
here um on on a git and

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,279
where you can see all the apps in the

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,519
world for now uh which

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,320
uh released under a free and open source

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,440
license

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,320
and um yes and also the european

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,440
commission

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,440
um just started to um

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,560
make sure that these apps can work

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,120
together so

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,800
because in the beginning of this crisis

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,120
we have been all in the lockdown

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,480
and so first of all it wasn't more or

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,399
less important to

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,000
have these apps available in your

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,880
country

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,440
but after the lockdown people started to

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,399
travel again also across borders

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,560
and as you know we have a lot of member

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,759
states and if every member state has a

00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,079
their own solution um which is um

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,759
not interoperable then you will have

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,279
problems in order to make sure to trace

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,160
contacts also

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,399
across borders and so therefore um the

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,279
european commission

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,839
also released the implementing decision

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,480
on that

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,720
and again strengthen the point of

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,440
interoperability of these apps

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,880
and so therefore they need to be free

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,759
software

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
and so thus you can make sure that um at

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,920
least in europe

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,959
um with most of the member states um

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
you can um have an app which is able to

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,560
communicate

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,839
with the app from another country and so

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,399
you can trace these

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,000
or you can use these tracing apps also

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,639
across borders and this is

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,480
only be possible um due to the fact that

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,759
this is released as a

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,199
free software so we've seen around the

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,880
corona tracing at debate that the use of

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,480
free software is very important in order

00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,240
to tackle

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,519
these crises which come which are yeah

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,959
global crisis and rare things happening

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,760
across borders what we've also seen is

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,240
that there were loads of hackathons

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,360
during

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,199
the last months and weeks and the thing

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,480
is that most of them have been funded by

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,439
governments

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,120
and so therefore um we also stepped into

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,799
the debate and said only free software

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,559
creates global solutions with all the

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,919
arguments you just heard

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:30,080
and um unfortunately we don't have

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,440
or we haven't been successful with all

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,840
of these hackathons

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,799
so for example the global hack hackathon

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,440
doesn't

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,360
release saying that these solutions have

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
to be free software in the end

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,440
but here you can see example and how we

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,360
try to also to reach out so we also use

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
social networks and not just mailings

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,720
and personal

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
contacts but we try to make it a public

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,360
debate around that

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,120
and so this strategy also helped us with

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,080
some other hackathons for example in

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,480
germany

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,240
and the results have been released under

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,760
a free software license

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:06,559
so you see there's still some

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,240
although room for improvement especially

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,640
when it comes to hackathons

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,880
and that our arguments are just here in

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,240
some parts of the debate but not

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,400
everywhere and so therefore it's

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,400
important to um

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,720
to still reach out to decision makers

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
and tell them about the advantages of

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,440
using free software especially when it

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:28,960
comes to such a global crisis

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,440
and also we've seen that

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,760
for remote working loads of us had

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
problems companies had problems but also

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,720
governments and public bodies had

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,440
problems so

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,080
they had to choose for example solutions

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,320
for video conferencing tools and

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
other tools to collaborately work

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,799
together

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,080
and so therefore we also together with

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,039
our community started to write on a wiki

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
and to bring together all free software

00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,640
solutions we

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,280
or our community have tested so far in

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,000
order to

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,480
present alternatives so that not

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,919
everybody have to go to zoom for example

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,440
but to use shitty or bigbluebutton

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,799
and so we also tried to collect it and

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,600
to spread the word about

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,280
free software alternatives which can be

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,440
more or less easily used

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,679
and this is a living document so if you

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,760
have any solutions in place

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,960
um please reach out to us we are happy

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,799
to add them in our wiki or

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,799
if you have an account there please also

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,559
just add them i think this is also

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,440
something very important to

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,960
not um just um yeah say it have to be

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,360
free software but also to

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,520
show that there are already very good

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,280
solutions in place

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,240
and also what we've seen during the

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,880
crisis was from the company side

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,520
um that many companies started to

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,000
promote

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,000
their property software as free software

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,760
and so what we've done is to write a

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,480
longer text on this and also

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,640
again refer to the for freedoms and go

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
to the most

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,640
strangest advertisements we have seen

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,200
and i have some for you here which i

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,919
want to present to you so for example

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,840
they

00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,240
offer the software for free but time

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,679
limited so this is clearly not a free

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,280
software

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,679
because it's very likely that you have

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,440
to pay fees for using the software after

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,240
the crisis

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,679
also what we've seen is that software

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,400
can only be used for

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,080
some work workstations or by a limited

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,919
number of users

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
and this is also clearly not free

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,919
software because we know the fear

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,840
for freedom's guarantee then you can

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,080
use it for as many workstations and for

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,360
as many users you wish

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,799
um also sometimes the word trial was

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,159
included

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:55,520
in the advertisement around the property

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,600
software promoted s3 software and this

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:59,760
is also again clearly not free software

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,679
because after the trial period ends

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,280
you have to pay the full fees for the

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,600
tools

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,440
and then this is also something which

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,400
happened quite often

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
that some vendors released their

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,640
software

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,000
for free for hospitals schools or other

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,320
specific sectors which

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,880
have been hit by the crisis very hard

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,919
but also this is not free software

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,000
um and you might up end up here in a

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,400
window log in very quickly

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,320
um because the for freedom guarantees

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,039
you that it's not only available in

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,320
hospitals but you can use it for every

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,799
sector you wish and also it's very

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,320
likely that once you

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,880
started to use this property software

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,000
that you might have update and upgraded

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,720
it again and then

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,400
you have to pay for the license in the

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,600
near future

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,720
um and the most strangest thing i have

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,240
seen

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,320
was a commercial for um property

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,159
software with the advertisement of

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,520
around free software because you can win

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,159
a license

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,159
um i mean this is also again clearly not

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,720
free software and even if you are one of

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,000
the lucky winners

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,360
you have to

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,799
pay one day for the software um so

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,559
also when it comes to updates and

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,400
upgrades again so

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,919
and the point is what i want to say is

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,720
it's really important to

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,559
um to have solutions in place so this is

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,960
a learning from this crisis

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,880
so that we need more free software um

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,840
solutions especially for governments so

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,039
and also that they

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:39,440
making can make sure that um citizens

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,320
then will have also secure software in

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,360
place

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,760
and not have to search for the quickest

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,159
and

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,360
uh probably best solution and then after

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,919
half an year

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,600
and they are ending in the window look

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,880
and then this is not helpful and all

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,520
at all and won't help to tackle a crisis

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,799
um also sometimes we've seen that

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,240
creator said they will

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,799
make the tool open source um i mean this

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
is also

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,000
currently not free software and also you

00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,120
have to be careful with these kind of

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,640
promises

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,600
so um because there might be only um

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,120
three parts uh um they might only three

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,679
parts of the software

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,520
and might then stop supporting the tool

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,720
with updates and so

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:25,600
then you are forced to buy an upgrade

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,159
and then again the non-free version and

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,039
so

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,679
um also and this is something where you

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,000
should

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,919
have a look at also um as a

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,840
last point on that i want to channel the

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,120
software freedom podcast which we made

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,240
with the new health project

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,400
and just uh i think one hour ago lewis

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,960
gave a talk on on the project and

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,520
um yeah you know if you want to hear a

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,080
podcast

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,000
and on that um you feel free to go on

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,960
our website this is a very interesting

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,120
project

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,880
and here you can see that there have

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,320
been already good solutions in place

00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,840
before the crisis and this is

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,679
i think something where governments

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,840
should invest money uh

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,880
in free software projects like canoe

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,000
health and not

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,840
uh propertary software which pushes you

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,039
into vendor logins and don't give you

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,039
the serenity

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:18,080
to act fast if a crisis appear

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,000
and already before this crisis started

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,760
we together with 100 organizations and

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
hundreds of thousands of people

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,840
demanded that publicly finance software

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,240
developed for the public sector

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,039
must be available under a free software

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,440
license

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,480
and our learning from this crisis is

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,360
that it is

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,480
um now even more important than ever

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,559
before

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,960
and so therefore we have this public

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,640
money public code in place where we are

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
demanding so if it's public money it

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,640
should be

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,960
public code as well here you can see

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,360
some of our supporters

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,400
so even have if you or your organization

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,200
haven't signed

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,080
this call so far feel free to do so and

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,640
also

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,440
reach out to us if you see somebody who

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,840
could

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,720
or should sign this and we will also

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,039
reach out

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,120
and yeah so we have also several ways in

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,240
how you can help us to make free

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,080
software

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,279
um the solution for for government so we

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,279
are not only

00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,880
[Music]

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,039
tasks but especially with this campaign

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
we've seen again that governments need

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,279
to be

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,520
convinced to use more free software and

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,760
yeah it's about many small people and

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,440
many small places who do many small

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,000
things that can alter the face of the

00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,600
world

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,320
so please help us in order to do so

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,480
and to convince governments to switch to

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,760
free software because as we've seen

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,760
during enterprise it's

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,880
desperately needed that we have free

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,880
software solutions

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,360
in place in order to make sure that we

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,720
can work together across borders

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,720
to tackle this crisis

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,279
so and i think now we have five minutes

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,559
left for questions if i can't answer

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,320
your questions right now

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:07,679
please uh also um send me email or

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:25,840
reach and then um

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:25,840
yeah i'm happy to answer questions

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,400
um so i see a question on um

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,000
[Music]

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,720
the free beer argument and that

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,559
some companies are not giving back if i

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,520
get it right so yeah for sure that's a

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,159
problem that

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,520
some companies just use it but

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,960
especially

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,279
with this campaign we are trying to

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,919
reach out to governments and convince

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,480
them

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
to share their code and also work

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,159
together

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:59,440
and so i think as i just said um

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,120
the public buddies are one of the key

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,799
players on the market and they can

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,200
change

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,080
the face of the software market if they

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,480
step in

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,440
and start to create these solutions and

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,720
share it with us

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,000
and also with others and so um as we've

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,840
seen also this

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,279
helps to foster the it market especially

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,159
around smes

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,600
and i think there are loads of good smes

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,559
around to

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,600
also give back and so a first step is

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,039
then

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,840
to to convince governments to also step

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,840
in here

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,279
okay so i just just wanted to point out

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,399
the the

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:47,360
fact of the schools which are really

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,120
important they are obviously uh public

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,039
administrations

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,880
most of the times i mean there are also

00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,120
private schools obviously but

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,919
talking widely the the most of the

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,880
schools are

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,240
public and i think that it is really

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,279
important to care about that just

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,960
because um

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,360
you know the schools are the starting

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,360
point from the society and the future of

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,919
our society so i think that

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:15,120
this kind of uh campaign should be uh

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,799
brought there uh as a first place as a

00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,039
first step

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,159
and then try to to begin from there just

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,000
because

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,080
it is important for the whole

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:27,279
administration but there

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,399
it is it is also about you know the um

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:32,880
plurality of of

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,159
solutions of um available uh

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,120
possibilities

00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,840
so that they should be uh uh they should

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,399
teach

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,679
this kind of uh topics and this kind of

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,880
you know notions

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,360
to the uh to the people to the guys uh

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,279
growing and attending the schools and

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,399
and possibly use in the schools

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:55,470
themselves and uh and that's it

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,960
just to close i can say that we had

00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,960
[Music]

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:04,080
i used to share um a blog post

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:07,919
uh advising that we initially have a

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,279
public administration who has um

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,480
shared how to say they have set up many

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,760
servers with for example gtc and kind of

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,760
this kind of stuff

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,200
and big blue button and whatever and

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,600
they are made them

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,000
available for the public schools but

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,399
they have been completely ignored

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,520
even being a public administration

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,600
itself so they

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,919
it looks like the the left hand doesn't

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,919
know the right hand in our

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,279
italian public administration so that's

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,240
really sad

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,200
and uh and that's another reason to to

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,399
go there and

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,840
let them know that there is uh public uh

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,520
code and public software and free

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,039
software whatever

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,840
and that's it and thank you for the

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,240
speech it was really interesting

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,080
thanks a lot so i'm i'm totally with you

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,600
uh i would be really interested in this

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,640
italian case so if you could send me an

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,640
email around that

00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,320
that would be awesome so i can follow up

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,159
on that and

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,480
yeah so else i think my time is over

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,000
thanks for listening and enjoy the rest

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:19,840
of this conference

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:19,840
