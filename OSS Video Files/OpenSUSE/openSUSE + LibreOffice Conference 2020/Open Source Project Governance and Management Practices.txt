of the authoritative control of open

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,960
source

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,280
in identifying common objectives for

support

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,319
it's all about open source project

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,920
governance money

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,680
then we go under open source projects

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,959
what does the process open source

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,519
projects requires

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,160
it doesn't require much as you can see

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,879
it just requires the governance

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,800
structures

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,040
how the government structures will look

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,360
like as you know everyone

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,840
knows what the government's governance

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,440
structure

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,959
is instructions all about who is

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,599
doing what and who is responsible for

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,239
what

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,440
and who is what what that governing

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
structure

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,599
is he simply didn't create that guys

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,680
themselves it include the

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,120
talk like the ceo who is the project

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
manager we start

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,120
that's what you're going to learn more

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,519
like in the open

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,400
source project that's what they it

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,560
requires

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,920
then we go on to the policies and

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
processes

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
we need to look into the policies the

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,319
procedure so that we

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,120
forget the quiet process

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,720
in in this instance you're going to

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,480
we're going to produce the

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,599
corona fire stand for example

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,599
so just feel delighted to

00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,799
be with me as i'm taking this flight

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,519
i'm so happy i'm so happy to introduce

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,080
to you the

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,280
policies and procedures i want to do

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,840
processes the

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,080
policies and process and lastly i need

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,360
to learn about the mechanism to show

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,920
strategic and

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,920
tactical

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,919
life organization what is that project

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,440
all about the project is something that

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,360
we need to do

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,199
and the line functional line

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
organization

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
the cabinets the

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,400
it should be dreaming that the business

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,840
cares whatever the business case is

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,840
all about the business case is a

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
documentary

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,520
that can lead us to the project

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,199
how the project should be go like how

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,639
the project should be like

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:11,840
like all the projects should

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,960
be like that business case is

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,560
is what what's going to be leading us to

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,039
then the business case we need to

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,639
continuously

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:25,039
we need to continuously refuel it

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,680
so that we can see the benefits of being

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,039
achieved

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:32,080
but the benefits are not being lost or

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:36,080
we are not doing the right thing

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,360
that thing it covers us

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,120
so what that is

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,240
coming in we have

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,960
three basic

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,280
items we need to look at the heart

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,400
factors we've got the soft factors

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,600
with what the environment affect us

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,280
is against heart failures

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,639
heart failures will be looking at the

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,319
delivery

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,319
what are the daily variables the quality

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,600
what quality of the product we need to

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,319
come up with

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,440
during this instance of creating a

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,120
chrono finance

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,479
truck the quality cost how much does it

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,880
cost to produce

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,880
how much does it cost after to

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,560
as you can see the corona devastated

00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:44,569
[Music]

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,000
the deliverables first we need to look

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,039
at the quality between the cost of

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,680
the deadline then you also want to soft

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,720
fitness one of the soft factor

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,360
sound figures are team dynamics

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,039
team experience team we are the same

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,400
softwares we need to look

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,919
into consideration the team dynamics the

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,440
conflict resolution

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:17,199
how do we solve the conflict between

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,919
the management and the other department

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
functional heads functional department

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,680
we need to look into

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,639
these and also the leadership issues if

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,560
the leadership

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,599
issue is in tax or is lost

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,919
that's what we need to to look at again

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,960
and also some cultural differences we

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,000
look at the cultural difference

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,720
difference like sometimes my team might

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,599
made up of people from different

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
cultures

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,240
maybe asia and some the africans like me

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,520
islamic european summer being white

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,879
and we need to look into it

00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,000
not not excluding the leadership issues

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,199
how the leader is composed of and

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,080
if the leader kept them taking

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,120
control of that point the league is the

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,240
leadership

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,120
capable of moving the

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
project to that production also the

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,000
success

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,240
instead us then you go into the

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,879
environmental factors what are they in

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,000
those development of it environmental

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,120
factors including

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
polycon power issues we need to

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,960
look at the politics we need to look at

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,919
the government

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,399
but the government has the power to to

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,159
push

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,599
us through whatever we want to do or

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,440
or else affected by the political issues

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,920
like this setting

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,080
a party might be coming using your

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,200
project that's for example it's not

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,920
water i mean

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,399
you might expect something then we're

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
going

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,920
through the managing this type of

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,000
expectation that is

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,120
the most important thing we need to

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,560
manage these things

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,959
take orders expectations what does this

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,560
require us to do they might require us

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,680
to produce

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,200
a small drag small dosage like this or

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,399
bigger like this those are the

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,920
expectations that was that then the guys

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,000
who are responsible for

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,959
giving us the platform to ignore

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,480
something

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,800
the stakeholders and also like ethical

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,040
and social issues around the office of

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:30,000
projects

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,560
social ethical and social issues is

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,600
there

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,680
any is the intensity

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,120
problem that might arise on social

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
problems in my

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,680
advice when the products has been

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,839
introduced in the society

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
then we move on to open source project

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,279
management

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,160
deals with this size and complex

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
business operations

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,720
the size of our project this has a

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,440
proper project might be a small one or

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,880
bigger

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:05,839
and how complex is it

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
sometimes so many engineers

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,839
taking into consideration segregation

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,200
duties you can

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,120
let someone do all jacob fortress

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,839
there's nothing like that when we

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,880
open source project development we need

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,279
to

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,040
observe the segregation of judiciary

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,240
laws and responsibilities

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,640
which is being performed by each and

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,720
every one of us we don't need someone

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,839
for variety we don't just because they

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,240
do affect the

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,640
product delivery to affect the whole

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,640
process

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,399
like the morale it can lead to bugs when

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,120
we are programming

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,560
so segregation to this is important in

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,839
the open source

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:14,399
project open source project management

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,000
project money project what is that

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,920
project money

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,200
all about maybe

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,959
i don't know but according to

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
what i know it is the knowledge and

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,880
skills and techniques

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,040
to knowledge skills tools and techniques

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,880
that being applied to broad range of

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,880
activities to achieve extended

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,399
objectives such as meeting

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,600
the defined user climate budget deadline

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,360
for open source projects so

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,399
whenever we are doing open source

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,720
project we need to look at the project

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,839
management which is the knowledge we

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,000
have to know

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,000
what they want to do we have the skills

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,279
do we have the tools do we have

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,079
techniques we have

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:02,639
to get the broad range of activity to

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,200
give

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,320
the techniques so that the project that

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,560
includes important

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,360
activities to achieve the stated

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,079
objectives

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,360
such as meeting the defined user

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,800
requirements we need to

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,279
take into that so that just because

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
we're not

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,880
making and nothing user requires you to

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,480
observe

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,320
because of the buyer because of the

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,959
deadline for

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,920
for that project it is a business

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,120
process

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,279
in the project-oriented organization a

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,240
project-oriented organization is

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,240
simply a business video you can say that

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,000
being driven by a certain project

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,200
that happened which we just got up this

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,680
project

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,839
the project chatter documentary like the

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,360
blue

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,920
this is the the framework that we use

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,200
in the in the whole process in the

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,320
production whatever

00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,600
the produce then what the project

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:04,880
we need for management process it was

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,240
five steps in project management process

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,480
firstly we would initiate initiatives

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,760
just coming up with the others

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,360
brainstorming

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,399
that initiative process after initiating

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,560
we need to produce

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:24,160
a coronary artery just because quran

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,079
covered 19 years being a problem

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
throughout the world so we need to

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,680
initiate an idea

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,800
after we have initiated we go on to plan

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,320
we need to plan how are we going to to

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,040
achieve our heart side purposes how it

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,760
said

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,760
because after that we execute

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,600
we execute the project during the

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,360
execution

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,720
process we need them the skills and the

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,040
knowledge which i have

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,440
mentioned earlier on we need to control

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,720
the project we need to control

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,440
this something which calls cops where

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
we lose the the wall control of the

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,519
project we are doing

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,519
what is wrong what is not expected that

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,199
then we go on to the monitor we need to

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,199
keep on monitoring the project

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,880
monitoring using the project charter and

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,600
also the

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,320
project schedules we need to monitor are

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,519
we still

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,360
in line are we still in within the

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,519
expectation that we need

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,399
to be expected and after that after

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,600
monday

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,600
everything went well what's going on

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,639
we need to cross the project because of

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,519
the project

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,639
because of the project after after

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,240
feeling that

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,959
sad that sad help was like the eurozone

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
climbing

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,399
we need to close the project that and

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,800
that was process

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,839
of initiating planning escalating

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,600
controlling

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
and crossing the project that the six

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,560
steps have been

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:01,839
involved in the project is being done

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,680
project management structure what is it

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,120
we've got three open source project

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,199
management structures

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,360
that we can implement with 10

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,000
organizations

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,199
firstly with the functional structure

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,279
organization

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,720
what is it is what's the function

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,360
organization

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,360
it is when the project manager just

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,880
called the staff function

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,360
there is no formal formal management

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,519
control is not giving authority to

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,519
take care of them that was functional

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,519
that means a fitting

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,040
department is functioning for the

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,920
individual function

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,800
is functioning so departments will be

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:44,399
contributing immensely in the product

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,880
in the in the production of the

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,519
product or the coming up of certain

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,320
project

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,279
so the project manager is not of great

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,959
use in that

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,560
organization the name of the project

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,639
structure organization

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,759
where the project manages for the former

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,680
authority and the buyer

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,120
who is responsible for the bargains in

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,000
the schedules in the team

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,800
the project money is just the teamwork

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,800
and also

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,360
it's giving the buying and schedule

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,720
structured project organization where

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,560
management authority is

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,839
shared between the project management

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,120
department heads

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,600
when the department heads must not

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,440
might give some power it's the that this

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,560
project manager might give some power

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
that's what this structure or project

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,160
organ

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,240
organization need to be like then

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,279
you will management draws and

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,079
responsible yes

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,040
i said earlier on i need to take you

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,880
through all the

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
management rules and responsibilities

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,160
for offering open source project

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,000
management

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,199
firstly we've got the project steering

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
commit

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,519
the project state committee is called

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,079
overall

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,160
dce overall for the direction and the

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,279
appropriate representation

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,000
responsible for the deliverables cost

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,560
and schedules the project steering

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
coming

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,280
stating comments something like all the

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,799
departments will contribute each and

00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,760
every one person

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,559
want to protect the certain project that

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,720
you've been

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,280
called upon the stepping committee for

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,559
performing the reviews imagine meeting

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,559
they are responsible for refueling

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,319
reviewing whatever is happening you can

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,280
also bring me meeting when something is

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,280
going wrong

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,959
it says that the coordination difference

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,240
there are advances to the project

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:33,039
just because it's made up of the war

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,039
organs of

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,160
department of function that if interest

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,120
in the project

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,559
make up the step comic it takes

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,880
corrective action

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,240
progress and issues is asking that it's

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,799
possible

00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,600
for whenever there is something which is

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,320
not well

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,240
they are responsible for correcting it

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,840
and also making them

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,760
the possible advancement

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,120
we've got the second limit for the

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,640
senior management is never

00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,640
committed to approve the services

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
we need them to approve the resources

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
for the budget

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,360
then the project response is responsible

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
for

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,640
funding because he knows that critical

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,360
success factors

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,480
and matrix formation success that's

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,400
project support

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,600
was the project sponsor is also

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,520
responsible for the

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:39,520
data and application portion is that

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,520
he's the one who is responsible for

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,799
taking the project the project after

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,080
each thing that

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,080
you've been finished or been completed

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,520
then with user management management

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,120
assumes the ownership

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,480
and resulting system allocates qualified

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,840
team reps participates in the process

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,960
design

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,360
system easy requirement definition test

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,520
case

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,880
as you can see the user management knows

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,200
what to use

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,080
in this case of quantifiers the user

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,280
management

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,400
knows what the patients want so that's

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,160
why

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,080
when it comes to design the iphone

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
when it comes to system requirement

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,080
definition from

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,200
the test case when you're testing the

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,200
drug or whatever

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,120
there's

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,679
user requirements and also use actually

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,960
they also

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,960
respond for user training

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,559
communicates them in works according to

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,760
the local standard

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,320
this used project team that's because

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,520
they know

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,440
much about about the project

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:19,679
then we've got all the money project

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,720
managed project managers

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,440
day-to-day management and leadership

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,400
facilitate the definition of the project

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
manage and

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
control activities via the project

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,080
scheme that the project might just drop

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,480
then he is also responsible for the

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,200
we've got the pilot assurance team

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,320
quality assurance to reveal the results

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,000
and deliverables

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,120
in each phase it confirms compliance

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,640
with the

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,640
quality assurance team

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,200
activities one when one whenever they

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,240
usually the process acquiring action

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
team

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,400
should be should always come in

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,559
certified

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,600
each phase confirms to the compliance

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,559
and the requirement

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:21,039
that we have said from the beginning

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,039
with system development management

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,960
system development they are technically

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,280
offer technical support to the

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,960
hardware and software yes again they

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,120
provide actual attack

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,720
these things stay quick according to

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,960
what we've learned

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,320
then we go on to the system development

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,360
project

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,200
this one completes and communicates

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,280
and works with the local standard the

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,440
system development

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
then we went to the security office

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,760
security

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,600
secreting their effective protection and

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,520
directive classification

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,919
cooperating with security policies and

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,760
procedures they are responding with the

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
corporate security policies and

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,679
procedures as well as

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,400
data classification was on data we have

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,840
the

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,520
personal identification

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,400
which which we don't need to be

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,919
to be exposed anyhow just because it's

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,039
sensitive dead

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,799
so the security security is responsible

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:21,919
for identifying

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,960
the sensitive dead the reviews

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,440
secure team test plan they also use this

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,799
test plan and report prior

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,039
implementations

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,039
systems security effective they also

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,880
look at the systems and effective mouse

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,840
effectivity system

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,520
developing setting system and also we

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,320
report the implementation in the

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,320
testimonials

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,880
the information system sector

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,280
engineering team

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:54,400
this one this one applies specific

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,400
in engineering to scientific and

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,280
engineering

00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,720
engineering expertise to minimize

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,840
security fundamentally in

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,520
containers contain the risk as against

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,280
the information security

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,280
engineering team that responsible

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,919
so that we can minimize the

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,720
vulnerability in the container risk

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,640
it's also able for defining the needs

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,000
requirements architectures

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,200
and design principles for breath defense

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,320
and breath

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,679
in broad security they are also

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:40,000
responsible for that

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:43,440
for the defense include secure issues

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:51,840
that this is thank you so much thank you

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:51,840
see how long after

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,919
