hello

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:11,760
can everyone hear me yes

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,760
okay great um

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,680
so um and

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,520
i'm i'm binghanting and the other

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,840
speaker is wong xiao

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,480
and our topic today is

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,240
working with native indigenous

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,740
communities to build

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,880
native language labor office projects

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,520
[Music]

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:41,840
okay this will be a light topic i think

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,840
but it's it's an important issue

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,760
so um indigenous people in taiwan

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,120
have been in a social economically

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,480
disadvantaged position

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,039
due to the historical mistakes made

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,239
by the government and the dominant

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,199
clause

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,320
and whereby the native languages were

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,519
replaced by

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,720
mandarin and

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:11,280
in contemporary society the

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,479
social economically disadvantaged

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,560
position

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,320
also excluded the indigenous peoples

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,000
from the tech from technology

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,159
and recently a government in taiwan

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,439
has decided to adopt the odf format

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:37,520
in place of other proprietary formats

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,400
as the national standard in the meantime

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,159
the official documents in indigenous

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,520
languages policy

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,479
requires official documents to be

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,680
written

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,960
in indigenous languages and

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,880
native areas so taking this

00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,079
together there is a rising need

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,280
in writing libreoffice documents

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,560
in indigenous languages

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,440
therefore native language

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,920
language version of libreoffice helps

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,480
both

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,800
the indigenous people and the government

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,680
we believe that if we could provide a

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,120
more

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
friendly software environment we can be

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,879
part of the

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,879
official documents in indigenous

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,840
languages policy

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,519
and we can increase the usage of

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,000
indigenous languages

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,000
with this

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,640
so this is something we presented

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,640
last year at the level kong

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,319
however this kind of project would

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,599
often involve complicated issues

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,599
of identity politics as

00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:02,000
we implemented the project this year

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,760
there were several public controversies

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,080
related to ethnicities in taiwan such as

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,640
ethnic discrimination on public videos

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
and inappropriate headlines on news

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,879
media

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,080
and these speeches

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,920
be deliberate or not would

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:27,360
cause harm to ethnic minorities

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,640
and lead to strains between ethnic

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
groups

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
therefore we need to pay more attention

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
to these

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,120
issues if we are to do things about

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
the indigenous community

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,680
and we have heard a few non-indigenous

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,239
community members asking us

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,159
like um i want to do something to help i

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,519
don't have indigenous friends

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:57,040
so i don't know if i will do something

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
inappropriate or they ask um who i can

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,439
work with can

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,000
truly represent the indigenous people

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
so to cope with these concerns we

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,159
consulted

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,879
people from the indigenous movement and

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,480
organized the things we've learned

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,799
throughout the year

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,799
and we've come up with three useful

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,720
steps to share with you

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,440
and everyone who want to join or

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:29,840
to build an open source project for the

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,840
indigenous community

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,880
we believe the first crucial step for

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,440
an outsider to participate in the

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,560
project

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,680
for the indigenous community is that

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,840
we should not be presumptionist

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,720
about what is good for the community

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,759
a classic bad example in this regard is

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,960
a classroom

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:03,039
full of unneeded e white boards and

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,440
computer hardware upgrades every year

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,160
we have seen them in some indigenous

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,600
tribes

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:12,400
as well as in urban schools and

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
some technology experts and some

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,120
government

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:20,320
officials they think this ui performs

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,000
as superior technologies but

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,320
they often disrespect disregard the

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,360
real needs of teachers and students

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
such situations are even more likely to

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,360
happen

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,560
in an indigenous context

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,080
people often have

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,759
orientalist biases and

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:49,360
make entirely wrong assumptions

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,400
about the indigenous community but

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,600
we should really ask what does it mean

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,639
to be indigenous what things do

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,800
indigenous people need

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:04,240
so the answer can vary from a tribe to

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,400
another tribe

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:12,240
but before diving into a new idea

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,000
for tech related projects you can

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,840
read some ethnography works find opinion

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
articles written by local indigenous

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,600
activists

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,800
or just ask them to figure out the

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,720
answers to to the questions

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,360
if you happen to have indigenous friends

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,000
what we want to emphasize here is that

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
the key

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,440
to understanding a different culture is

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,800
to know the local view

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
so you will really know what they need

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,840
and

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,840
what you can build for them

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:55,599
okay so step two the second step is to

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,840
find

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:03,680
the right people to connect with

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,360
recently when the government in taiwan

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,280
tried to find representatives for

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:14,319
each indigenous people they selected

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,199
a representative for the kavalan people

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,400
who was

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,080
actually not engaged in indigenous or

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,639
local affairs

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,479
and the incident backfired on the

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,639
government severely

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:32,240
suggesting that we should be wary of the

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,639
issue of representativeness when we try

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,039
to

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,479
connect with the indigenous community

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:44,400
we ourself also made a similar

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,680
mistake one of us once went to a tribe

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:51,680
to to start a collaboration with uh

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:54,720
with them but he only got approval from

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,000
the local priest and the head of

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,039
the village who was an elected

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,680
government official he did not seek

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,039
permission from the leader of the

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,720
indigenous tribe

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,720
and the leader was quite angry

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,520
so each group or organization

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
in the indigenous community is a little

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,800
universe

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,800
like families kings clubs schools

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:27,599
churches meetings tribes and some

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,039
that don't even have words for them and

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,240
they are always

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,560
always overlapped and intertwined and

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,839
they all have different opinions and

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,279
interests

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,680
moreover there are at least three types

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,159
of

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,880
indigenous political structures in

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
taiwan

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,320
according to anthropologists

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,440
and each political structure have

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,680
has its own power dynamics and decision

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,880
making rules

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,519
therefore it is really dangerous just to

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,200
assume

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,959
that the indigenous community forms a

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,959
homogenous whole we we should understand

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,519
and respect the contracts and

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,200
different decision making processes in

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
age group

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,959
and you will find the right people to

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,399
begin

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,360
your work only after you make efforts to

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,080
understand the complex realities of the

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,080
community

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,160
or privileged capability exposure

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,160
process

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,279
so why and how does your community it

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,399
turned out that

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,839
it's not that straightforward

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,839
simply just mount

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,120
in a tribe would make the residents have

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,200
an

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,320
aversion or feel even feel insecure

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,440
so avoid this kind of mindsets and try

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,640
to follow

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
these tips

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,360
first get the people familiar with the

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,880
concept of free

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,279
and open source software emphasis

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,240
on the non-profit aspect of free

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,399
software

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,880
so they will know that you are not

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,360
trying to make money out of this

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,680
the best way of doing this is to start

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,880
your first events in a tribe

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,760
with free classes of labor office and

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,000
other free software apps usually

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
education is a neutral concept

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,519
and it is a trustworthy medium to

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,120
generate generate

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,320
choice so highlight your project as an

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,200
educational resource as well also

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,480
do not stay close with unpopular people

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,760
and politicians

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,399
even when they seem to be very helpful

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,480
avoid them forever if you make your

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,360
first appearance with people

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
who are not trusted in a tribe your

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,839
first impression

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,120
will surely be affected so pay attention

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,000
to the power dynamic

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
in a tribe and

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,399
and choose the right person as we talked

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,680
about earlier they can be

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,959
teachers or local ngo workers usually

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,880
but there are not politicians

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,120
usually and finally mutual trust these

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,839
two supports when you are trying to

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,200
advocate

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,360
policy the trust that you work hard

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,360
to build can help you when you are

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,760
trying to change something in the tribe

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,560
and even legislation related to your

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,200
project

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,519
for example if you want to convince a

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,800
local elementary school to try liberal

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,600
office in class

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,079
or if you just want to want more people

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,079
to share the concept of free software

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,279
for you in a tribe

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:09,200
mutual trust can be really helpful so

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,360
let's recap

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
we have three steps the first is to

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
abandon your

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,120
presumption just don't assume anything

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,120
before you re do your homework

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,360
and the second step find the right

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,560
people to connect with

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,360
and like ngo workers or teachers

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,279
and third maintain relationships based

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,000
on mutual trust

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,880
and that will really help you when you

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,880
are trying to

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:43,760
like make more people use libreoffice

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,800
instead of pirates microsoft office

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,600
