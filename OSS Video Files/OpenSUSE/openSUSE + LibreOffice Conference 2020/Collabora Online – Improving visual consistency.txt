00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,520
okay so

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:18,160
okay so hello my name is pedro i'm

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,160
a lead lead designer at collabora

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,600
you can also

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,880
you can also get a hold of me on twitter

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,920
that is my handler um

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,239
so let's start it

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,239
um

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:44,480
as the topic of my

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:48,879
uh talk uh says here

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:52,960
i'm going to talk about uh consistency

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:56,000
visual and how um

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,120
code and design interface

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,800
um and the structure uh actually

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,600
live uh together and um they are kind of

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,640
cyclic

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,119
in this uh in the the in our workflow to

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
improve

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,240
uh collaboration um if like

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,640
today's last day so probably you know

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,520
what this uh caller online

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,520
but if you have any any other question

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,200
how to get the code how to contribute

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,479
how to

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,280
uh or where is this where are these

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,680
things

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,320
or how to even build collaborator online

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,079
for your

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,200
particular distro you can go ahead

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,560
um over

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,840
collabora online.github.io

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,920
and you will see uh

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,520
some nice posts there of course you can

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,360
visit faq but also really cool

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,159
is our build how to build collabora

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,479
online

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:02,799
post where i recently

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,799
updated and also mohamed cara also

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
helped here with the instructions from

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,319
other distros so

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,759
if you want to add additional

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,800
instructions there

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,360
um or if you see any problem feel free

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
to

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,480
report um and we will

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:24,080
you know make it easier and

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,200
easier to get and even overall uh

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,239
more friendly right so uh we are

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,360
we are uh we care about um

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,400
uh easy to use not only in the in the

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,560
in the software itself but even

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:44,959
the whole workflow in and out

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,400
so visual consistency

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,440
normally we might we might think

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,120
about consistency being just

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,560
visual but i i will

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,840
try to jump between code

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,599
interface interface and code and also

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,440
um mentioned that

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,519
actually this division can be quite

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,640
blurry and that's okay

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,080
and you can even benefit from that

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,800
um so on one side

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,080
we might have some code structure or or

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,720
some changes on uh

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
in in the code and on the other side we

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,000
have uh

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,280
interface decisions design decisions

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,319
that we need to

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,519
take and

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,480
more often than not when we need

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,840
or we are we want to work in a specific

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,599
component

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,720
for example uh i wanted to

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,760
make sure that some specific components

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,599
in our toolbar

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,000
but also across other other sections

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
were more consistent between each other

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
and these

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
uh actually generated quite nice

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
discussion and

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,680
let me um kind of motivate

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,200
a a clear css

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:12,640
and so um we start this whole process

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:16,239
of cleaning this up making

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,440
um this uh visual consistency not only

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,440
in the end result but even

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,160
uh within uh the the software itself

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,720
right so

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:32,080
we try to split in many different files

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,520
these files then are become easier

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,840
to hack easier to style

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,160
because they start to correspond to the

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,560
to the components itself

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,280
themselves not only in a logical way but

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,560
even in the

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,400
in the visual manner um we tried to

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,960
reduce

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,840
any i tried to reduce any resident rules

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,000
across

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,360
all files and i also started to feel

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,199
the need and started and my anxiety

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,400
started to be through the roof because i

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,240
really wanted

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,280
uh to enforce uh some consistency

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
and consistency in terms of the

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,840
formatting itself

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
but also the rules we we we should

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,479
follow in terms of

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:21,680
linked so um we also

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,440
and i a little bit more on these later

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:29,199
um we also try to avoid guessing

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,199
uh or at least trust 100

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,600
um in css media queries

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
uh because we encounter many problems

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
right

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,360
and we started to see many phablets with

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,880
uh very diverse resolutions

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,080
but also many tablets with uh weird

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,280
uh not only even

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,280
weirder uh form factors

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,680
um from uh different uh

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,600
you know different manufacturers um and

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,880
on top of that

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,400
we we had these two little guys

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,160
fighting each other yeah sometimes css

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,280
would say one thing sometimes javascript

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,560
say one thing

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,000
and we really uh made effort uh to

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,080
uh soften all these uh

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,280
partners and and rely

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,639
mainly in in the javascript size

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:32,160
side um and this proven to be

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,080
a a win uh win situation in in many

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,360
cases not only for mobile but also for

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,680
for tablet

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:45,199
then i basically tried to

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,720
have it in an automatic way so

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,479
using style lint there is

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,960
many other uh ways to to

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
to help in in linking your code but

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,680
styling

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:04,000
is is one and um i try to

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,120
have it automatically checking um

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,759
online at each make run

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,199
and so not only i went manually to each

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,160
each each file we have checking all the

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,080
rules

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,400
but also it was important to exclude

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,919
third-party files for this we have some

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,520
uh not that many but we have like one

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,080
two uh libraries that they have their

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,160
own

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,120
css files and it was important to

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,360
exclude them

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,360
because in the future if we want to keep

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
it light and flexible

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,880
the update of those files we don't need

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
to

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,120
we don't need to worry so much about

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:45,919
their formatting we can just

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,319
update them and take the upstream

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,520
formatting that they use

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,560
uh yeah big thanks of course for uh

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
for henry that kinda helped me out in

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,280
this in this

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
final process of including the make run

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,759
and for instance this is one example now

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
not only the javascript is

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,720
checked but also the css site is checked

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,759
and in here we see that

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:15,039
we have duplicated selector

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,160
that we probably forgot uh about

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,919
uh maybe we we declared in at the

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,120
beginning of the file and then we we

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,039
declared again

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,560
at the end and we forgot so it's this

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:28,160
really helpful

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,599
to keep the things tidy and even easier

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,839
to

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:37,519
backfix and overall to improve

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:41,200
the the the visual

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:44,159
and the whole interface so by making it

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,880
uh this side of the question crystal

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,720
clear

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,440
it then uh looked back and benefit back

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,080
the the

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,560
interface because suddenly things were

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,560
easier

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:02,160
easier to work

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,200
and with that

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,120
next step was being sure that maybe a

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,800
couple of things on the javascript

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:14,240
javascript side

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:17,519
was also were also clean

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,320
and so for instance and

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,440
we tried to decrease the redundancy

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,880
especially in the

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:29,920
dialog site so for instance

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,920
we have here our insert command

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,440
that uses vex

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,800
and also here on mobile also uses the

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,640
vex library so

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,959
um we it's it's not something

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
that remarkable but it has really a

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,880
remarkable

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,360
impact uh then in maintenance and even

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,680
in the

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
in the visual side of the question so

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,680
big thanks for

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,800
uh pranam uh that really uh

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,720
hunt these beats down and made sure that

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,160
everything was consistent so

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,079
now we can uh just deal with these

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,040
things in one place instead of

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,040
multiple places

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,720
and again it looked back to the

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,519
interface

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:16,160
this allowed me and motivated me to even

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,440
go further and really check every single

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,959
state of our component uh be sure that

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,240
all states are accounted for

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,839
and here you see that not only

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,360
we are using for instance comments

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,360
annotations and of course

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,000
uh the tracking changes

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,800
um components there are also annotations

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,920
but they come from tracking changes and

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,680
does they do look different

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
they do have slightly different

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,320
components on them

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,440
even though you can even comment in

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,000
in these tracking changes used in

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,399
libreoffice on your desktop but it was

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
important to make this

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
this clear you know when when are you

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,160
typing when are you not typing

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,839
when you are viewing what's the

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,800
difference between

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,800
these hierarchies

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,959
and these so we are just going to talk

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,079
about really i really like this this

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,800
this positive kind of coincidence

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,360
we a little bit a bunch of coincidences

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,800
but

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,320
really positive because you see since we

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,880
work so much in

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,079
uh in this collaborative way pranam

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,079
starts to work on one

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,440
side i go i i i started to work on on

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,120
the other side

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,880
requests and i thought that also

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:44,320
sent someone online

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:48,000
in know web browser yeah i'm

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,160
hearing uh yeah thanks um

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,079
and then there was this opportunity to

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,480
bring more features to mobile so for

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,440
instance

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
we have here how we were displaying

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,079
comments

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
on mobile and it was quite tedious

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,839
because you

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,399
need especially on a phone you need to

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,760
uh

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,120
use you need to drag and pan

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,680
to see your comments and now there is

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
this possibility now we are using the

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,519
same vex

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,480
library now we are using the same um

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,560
code

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
we can share not only the code but also

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,880
the aesthetics of

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,800
it um and the same rules

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,240
and of course this is a work in progress

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,639
many things are still

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,920
they still need to be improved but it's

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,639
awesome effort

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,600
initiated from pranam and now we get

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,040
benefits

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,519
uh not only in the code itself um

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,399
and for instance uh there were there

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,200
will be many

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,320
um easy hacks and other things that you

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,920
can help with

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,160
so a very a really easy hack and

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,639
it's quite a good first issue to get

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,600
your feet wet is

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,240
simply to uh you know replace our

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,880
trigger

00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,680
that was um that were that were

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
signifying

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,240
uh insert comment to something uh that

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,880
doesn't have the plus

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,639
uh that that simply signifies that you

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,399
are going to trigger the comment

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,399
section the the comment panel

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,000
um a lot lots of

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,600
great work from shimon on on this front

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,279
on the javascript front

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,720
uh and if you see other talks you

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,920
already

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,040
saw and and and and listen him going

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,160
through all the

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,560
technical bits but the cool thing is

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,600
that

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,880
this led this all these things you see

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,760
here

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,240
left to a cyclical uh improvement right

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
so

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,160
uh even though it was something came

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,680
from uh javascript and all

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,079
it was something actually that then

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,279
encompassed um

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,160
css design and it was something that

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,440
started

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,360
from a necessity or a motivation

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,880
far from the design realm but then

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,480
it benefit that design

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,240
site and of course fixing and unifying

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:12,560
uh units used uh in input fields

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,920
spinners all these controls

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,639
were also quite this

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,920
this there was a an opportunity that was

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,120
enabled

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,639
by all this uh effort um

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,079
so then we try to make sure that

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,480
the user knows which units is working on

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,199
which type of components is working on

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
even without

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,360
reading so because they don't read they

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,600
really just scan

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,720
um and even feedback from users

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,360
users and customers were uh

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,920
taking into account so for instance even

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,440
though

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:55,279
we uh click we

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,079
frequently save the document um

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,560
and we used to have a back chevron a

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,760
back

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,120
arrow to to leave the app people were

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,160
quite afraid

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,839
to press that icon um and so

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,519
because they didn't know they wanted to

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
be sure it was saved even though it

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
even if it was already saved so they

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,160
were always going to unburger menu

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,279
be sure that it was saved and and then

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,639
press the arrow

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,320
uh icon so we

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,519
just replaced that with the check mark

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,079
and we even uh in we even

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,040
in faticide we even increase uh its

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:35,199
importance

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,160
uh by means of you and callers so

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,320
they can be quite uh comfortable that

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,120
this is not a destructive

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,959
action and it's quite a positive action

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,440
it will just save the document and leave

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,440
the tab

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,279
now and there is many things i i want to

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,120
talk here but maybe

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,199
i will go fast because i really have

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,320
many slides so but for instance

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,720
inactive states was also a big a big

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:06,079
section um not only um not only

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,560
in the visual side but also in the code

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:11,519
side so for instance i i noticed that

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,399
these these states were not being

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,880
communicated

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,320
that well so i wanted to improve that

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,480
and then i found out that actually the

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,279
javas there were many javascript

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,560
javascript pieces that were still uh

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,759
listening and active

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,560
so then it forced me to fix those parts

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,320
and then go

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,040
back to design and then finally have the

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,680
states i wanted uh you know so every

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,600
so then every site benefited even though

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,480
in this case it was a motivation came

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,120
from

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,360
design so it's really interesting and at

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,560
least for me it's it's quite curious

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,160
to see these two sides they are actually

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
not two sides they are or at least they

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,040
are

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
two sides of the same coin um now

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,120
opening pdf

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,399
it's an amazing effort uh

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,320
especially from kwiki um

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,160
and he already presented the technical

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,279
bits of this but it

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,480
i wanted to take a moment

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,120
and let see sink in the the challenges

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,919
and the awesome results we got from this

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,880
um

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,439
so it was important to provide the clear

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,120
um

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,240
interface um to

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,600
view a pdf with collabora online

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,839
and there is many ways to do it

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,640
depending on your storage

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,640
uh service

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,600
but in here we are not editing anymore

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,559
we are not modifying per se the document

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,400
structure

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,280
we are here mainly to view a document so

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
we really clean

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,440
everything that was useless in this case

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,919
and we let up

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:51,520
we we let up front actions like search

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,799
rename the document or and of course

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,240
navigating through uh either existing uh

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,799
markers existing annotations or

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,360
newly created annotations for example in

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,679
here

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,320
and of course they are still a long way

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,240
to to make this even better and i have

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,880
uh at least my mental road map things

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,440
to make it much better but um it was

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,880
nice to

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:20,480
i can i could be uh

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,760
watching or listening akara presenting

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,440
taking my notes um or it doesn't it

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,679
doesn't need to be even like in that

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:31,760
form factor if you have

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,799
a4 it will also work um

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,080
and you can then just let

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,200
this this main action uh

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:44,080
up front which is viewing

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,360
and taking notes now the workflow

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,200
doesn't

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,440
start or end within clever online

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,559
it was quite important to know what it

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,240
happens

00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:00,000
after or before the pdf

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,600
gets to collaborate online so it

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,679
there was a lot of of testing um

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,200
to be sure that okay these annotations

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,039
are uh properly

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,600
uh possible to view in different

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,720
uh pdf viewers as a matter if you are

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,440
on windows linux

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,840
they should be be able to to view them

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
and

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,919
navigate and

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,120
of course import them so um again it was

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,160
really interesting

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:35,919
uh demo shown by kwiki

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,960
i think yesterday and it again there is

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,840
room for a user experience improvement

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,240
here right

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:47,280
uh maybe a way to

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,400
to show the user which pieces uh

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,600
are actually pdf incorporated in your

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,720
odp and there is a lot of ideas

00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,640
going on so i i just i'm quite

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:07,120
motivated to to to just have time to

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:10,320
you know to improve it even further

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:15,280
now um something

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:19,120
i also focus quite a lot

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,240
is this reaction reaction um

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:27,760
hair so what is the trigger

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:31,360
and what's the result does the result

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,440
is somehow connected or gives you any

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,720
idea of what it was a trigger and

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,919
vice versa so

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,120
initially we had some troubles

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,840
uh with with the cloning

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,400
for instance styles and we really wanted

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,960
to chat

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:53,280
to to use the respective cursor for this

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
um

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:01,039
before we were using some kind of legacy

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:04,240
uh icon the problem is that this icon

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,480
was resulting in many repo

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
some some reports not many because many

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,559
when we compared to other reports we

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,919
received

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:14,080
but some reports um that people

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,679
were getting confused wait but am i

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,400
going to

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,720
like change the feel of my cell or what

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
is

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,240
going on here i didn't press this um

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,799
even though

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,760
it was like functional functional wise

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,240
it was

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,600
actually working uh quite well it was

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,080
just something about

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,280
the disconnection between the trigger

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,440
and

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:41,520
the result and so a very easy

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:46,640
solution just swapping the icon

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:49,280
again result in a remarkable positive

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,440
feedback from these initial negative

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,360
reports

00:21:51,440 --> 00:22:00,240
now there were many

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,240
features enabling

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:07,440
viewing and editing documents online

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:11,120
be that on ios or android

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:15,280
but with all this enabling there were

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:18,480
many challenges that were needed to be

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,799
solved for instance in

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,840
in here we see odt

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,600
and we started to receive

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,640
some requests uh and some

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,000
worried requests about um

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,280
the missing word count uh

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,840
feature uh and initially we we thought

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,799
it could be simply inside of the view

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:47,120
sub panel

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:50,559
but we start to notice that many people

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,640
using mobile and not only

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:56,159
uh of course not only uh phone but also

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,520
tablet

00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:02,320
we're trying to find some kind of a easy

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,720
shortcut for this word count

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,159
not only for the selected text but the

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,440
whole text that they wanted to

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,760
to see these with the less uh with the

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,799
with

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:16,320
little uh effort possible so

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:19,360
in here we kind of um

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,360
enhance that uh position that place

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,080
to a more uh upper level uh

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,559
position in the hamburger and this is a

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,760
small

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:33,039
change that actually uh resulting in

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,480
happy users um and and again it was

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,799
these little reports these little

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,679
comments that

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,520
previously candy was talking about that

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,760
we are receiving a lot of comments

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,520
uh for instance in the in the play store

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,760
but even in the emails

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,799
and you know we try to answer all of

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,840
them we even try

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,640
to not only read but really think

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,720
uh and try to get together how many

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,679
people are are saying the same thing

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,320
um you know because at the end it's for

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,799
them that

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,799
we are uh doing this they are they need

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,840
to be able to use it in the the

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,240
easiest possible way um

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,960
another big challenge was uh for

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,159
instance in caulk

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,559
people do not or at least the people

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,360
that you do use

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:23,039
the app on mobile do not remember

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,320
specific or might not remember

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,600
in specific the function that they want

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:31,360
and they really wanted a way not only to

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,480
insert a function

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,000
but a more exploratory way to learn

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:41,440
about the the the function and

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,640
it's it was not a a plus b

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,320
report that we received this but it were

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,159
many reports of people that were

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,960
inserting uh

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,440
the the function that wrongly they it

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,120
was

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
not that function they wanted so they

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,520
always need to go back

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,039
and insert multiple times so in here

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,000
um still in one-handed uh interface we

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,720
we managed to have there some little

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
helper

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,840
that they can always press that uh that

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,400
icon and they

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,480
get to know more about the the function

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,559
uh and these and there is a lot of room

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,840
so even if the function is

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,919
not only text but if we manage to even

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,559
bring not only text but even other

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,679
things

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:26,960
that are already available be that

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,840
images or even examples suddenly these

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,000
uh this little section can be quite

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,640
educative

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,039
of course it's always a balance between

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,640
uh

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:42,320
how much you can show

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,279
until it's too much so it's it's

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,679
important

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,039
um but we we notice that more people

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,840
start to appear

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,880
uh i'm not sure if it was because uh it

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,080
you know it was

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,279
the leap year uh but it they were quite

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,799
happy with these

00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:01,600
uh nice little change um

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,400
and it's always uh you know it's it's

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,679
always

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,880
really nice to hear uh nice

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,480
you know positive words uh from from the

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,960
users from the final users

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:20,799
then i also made try to make a couple of

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,000
uh videos that do show

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,440
the average joe that that uses

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,960
for instance google docs that

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:34,240
many times their um

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,080
their complaints or their requests

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,480
are without uh reasoning

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,000
yeah or maybe they didn't really look

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
that further

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,159
so we have to hear three examples the

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,440
copy pasting scaling

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,640
images or even apply master slides and i

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,120
dare you

00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,400
try to apply master slides on for

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,039
instance uh

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,559
google docs or try to scale images on

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,159
the go what i mean on the go i don't

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,480
mean tablet i mean really

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:09,360
a phone try it or even copy pasting

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:11,520
it's it's it's it was just very uh

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,640
very funny even to go through this

00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,799
process

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,919
and and both and we are here talking

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,679
both on android and even on ios

00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:24,960
and on ios the the some of the scaling

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,880
uh just scanning an element was really

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,720
really i don't know you just need to

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,159
watch it or even try it maybe try it

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,559
will be even funnier

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:37,600
um but of course so we are

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,080
always here at least i'm here mentioning

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,039
multiple times consistency yes

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,240
consistency

00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,520
is is the key yes consistency is is what

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,080
we are aiming for

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,120
but at the same time we really do not

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,120
want

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,120
to lose our flexibility

00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,960
and with this we also we we also

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:05,520
keep an open ear for for all the

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,640
requests or even suggestions so notebook

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,840
bar was quite a

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:13,520
high as a request we were receiving

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,960
um and yes it's now shining in all its

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,799
glory

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,600
and there is many little pieces that

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,960
needed to be solved

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,840
specifically for online not only

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
because online has specific limitations

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,240
but also has

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,960
specific context and there are things

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,880
that are

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,039
they have still and thanks god they are

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,120
still um

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:39,120
quite a room for improvement and that

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,279
and that's nice because it keeps us

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,640
uh you know in our toes and we want to

00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,960
do it uh

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
keep it doing it better but i call your

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
attention for

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,919
again the amount of functionality that

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,960
we were able to bring

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:59,760
up front and many of these

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:02,159
things were also coming from

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,760
the the feedback we we keep receiving

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,960
also from the customers and from

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:09,440
all the users that they do have

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,799
and maybe they are the necessity of

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,559
those users

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,799
sometimes they are different from the

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,880
necessities of the same users

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,600
when they are using a desktop app and

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,440
not on a browser or on the go

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,559
or on a tablet etc but of course

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,000
all many of these things still need to

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,200
be accessible

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,600
even if they were not the main goal of

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,440
those

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,799
users at least not their main

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,000
necessities so for

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,080
all these they are still able to reach

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,520
be that via a second layer

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,960
or a left click but they are still

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:55,760
there so we want to have it flexible but

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:59,039
without leaving any power in the table

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:02,320
in the caulk side

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,919
it was quite it's it was quite a

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,120
challenge to know

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,760
which which of those things were were

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,120
important in this case and of course

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,159
we need to be very thankful

00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,760
for haiko and all the the the

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:22,720
the good discussion that is generated

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,200
not only now but even along all these

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
years

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,760
because there's many things that were

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,640
already a big concern already

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,159
uh thought out very well on on the

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,279
desktop and of course we are not

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,679
blind uh blind to this

00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,559
but i also call it your attention for

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,840
the

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:45,120
status bar the status bar

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:48,159
um we started to to see uh

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:50,960
people um that were complaining

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,880
about something that actually that

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,840
actually it exists exactly

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,720
like this even in other office suites

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,840
which was

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,360
uh when nothing is selected there was

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,200
nothing was saying that nothing was

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,080
selected simply in the status bar was

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,559
empty

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,960
and online and online and because people

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:13,120
sometimes use different

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,480
um you know interfaces i mean physical

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,640
interfaces sometimes they use

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,760
a mouse sometimes they use a finger and

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,640
they were really

00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,919
wanted to have a good feedback if

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,519
anything is selected

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,240
or if something else is hidden but it's

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,519
selective

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,000
and even about insert mode uh so it was

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,080
also

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:37,679
a good little touch that we did there

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,600
now of course this takes some room

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,510
for small factor screens

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,799
and of course we had this

00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:48,080
[Music]

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,200
in mind and from these you can very

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,720
easily

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:55,919
just tab just press click your tab

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:59,519
uh hide your sidebar and you can see now

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,840
your whole big slide even in a small

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,840
screen

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,000
when i mean flexible i also

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,840
do not want to forget the the the

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,080
friendly the friendliness

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,880
so many people still prefer classic

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,720
and the classic stool toolbar is still

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,960
there

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,080
and it's still rocking with all this

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,519
functionality

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,880
uh the the ruler got also uh

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,840
revamped uh in a different size

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,679
we also work closely uh with for

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,320
instance next cloud on cloud to to make

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,000
sure

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,440
uh that everything is nice and tidy

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,440
in their own you know

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,120
solution because again we need to

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:52,159
account for the workflow

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,159
in and outside of uh collabora online

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,600
and of course make it yours so i did

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,919
a talk well it

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,200
seems that it was last year and i guess

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,240
many things happen

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,440
this is so last year

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,799
how you can costumize

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,159
your collabora online you know even if

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,799
you don't want to

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,840
contribute which of course i advise

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,399
against

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,960
and but you know if you if you have your

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:23,840
own

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,679
uh your own family you just want to do

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,399
some funny thing you maybe you want to

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,559
do

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,519
you want to customize icons or something

00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,080
for your kid

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,880
or something like this you can do it and

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,919
in this talk

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,320
i try to guide you uh

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,600
through that so so i advise you to to

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,279
watch this

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,200
but i want to spend too much time

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:46,159
talking about this right now

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,679
but what you can do is take along and

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,440
help

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:56,000
and we do need help but we

00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,480
have been receiving some really uh

00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,279
positive feedback and i will go there in

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,159
a moment

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:07,120
but for instance uh styling um

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,679
there were many things that were fixed

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,320
uh

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,879
i uh introduced css vars finally on

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,079
and you can see it upstream and of

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,440
course there's still room

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,760
and we use it already in many places

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,560
you know so it's very easy now to use

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,159
the official

00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:29,040
uh libreoffice uh color branding um

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,800
and it's it's it's nice it's tidier and

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,480
it avoids

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,280
it avoids for instance problems that can

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,839
come

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
from newcomers that want to contribute

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,760
and that that's nice

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,839
um and of course it improves the overall

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,440
consistency not only the colors but also

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,320
phones etc

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,800
even easier to to to hunt where where

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
it's

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,720
where is the bug or what where is the

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,720
the place that needs fixing

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,920
um but this is only getting better

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,119
um and i'm uh

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,160
really happy to say that

00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,920
we have we have been receiving a

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:13,839
really nice feedback regarding this

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:17,280
this this page i try to

00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,640
make it as easier

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,040
to find information i could

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,800
so we have upfront to build collabor

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,760
online but you also have built

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,320
for android you have the easy hacks if

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,160
you enter

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,240
the ezx you will also see consistently

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,079
showing up the last three easy hacks and

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,800
you can go to github then

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,400
um but also how to report bugs what

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,040
about translators

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,119
uh you know how to to to do these things

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,680
first with webblade etc and of course

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,280
all the channels for uh communication

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,359
but of course if you have any uh

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,079
feedback even in this uh

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:55,200
in this side of the things like the the

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,720
website i'm really

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,240
here uh to hear um

and it's really amazing to see

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,560
all the new contributors

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,200
that we have and i say neo i should pro

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,599
say

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,119
new old contributors right but they are

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,800
new in a sense that

in this cholera online and

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,280
