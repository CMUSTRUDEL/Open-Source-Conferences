	00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,160
yeah welcome everybody to

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,160
the discussion session with the open

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,000
source board

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,599
um as everybody has noticed

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,400
uh we have this conference this year in

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,080
a completely new format

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,439
first of all we have it together with

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,800
the libreoffice community

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,400
and to my mind i think this is a

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
is a big win really uh

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,440
not only that both communities are

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
growing together

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,760
but there is also much more exchange

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,120
than if we would just be on the open

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,879
source community or

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,879
the libreoffice community or something

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,280
like that

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,399
then of course we have the the case that

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,199
everything is just

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:54,800
virtually on online um

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:57,280
we used to have normally a board session

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,359
uh face-to-face meeting for one or two

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,960
days before

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,760
this could of course not take place so

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,560
we have all the preparation done via

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,520
chats

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,439
and telegram groups and something like

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,200
that and

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,200
um this technical format now

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,759
was a bumpy start yesterday we had a

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,799
couple of of issues but i must say the

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,400
technical team

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,680
has resolved this very very well and

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,119
so a big thanks from my and from the

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,400
board side

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,560
uh to the to the technical team

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,079
which was to my understanding mostly

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,479
consisting of the

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,680
document foundation people uh that was a

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,920
really good job thank you very much

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,479
so my name is axel brown my colleagues

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,159
from the board are with me

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,240
um so what do we want to do before we

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
have the question and answer session

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,960
and the discussion with the board i want

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,560
to talk a little bit about

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,079
our community who we are

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,520
how many we are how we are discussing

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,560
um a little wrap up what has happened

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,920
since

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,040
the last open susa conference

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,040
then later question and answers

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,040
my board colleagues are in the

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,720
discussion in the talk here as well

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,760
if you have any questions uh

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:28,239
please uh interrupt

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,640
um i cannot see the chats bar at the

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,400
moment because i have the

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,400
screen shared

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,800
so um how many are we

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,000
in the open some souza community and the

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,360
clear answer is

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,879
we don't know we have an indication

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,959
and this is the amount of machines that

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:56,160
are accessing our update servers

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,640
so these are only numbers that are

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,159
direct or machines that are directly

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,000
accessing

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,480
the updates of course we cannot count

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,720
those machines that are updated via

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,000
local repositories or local cache or

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,720
something like that

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,720
and here we see we have an approximate

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,000
number between 250

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,519
and 300 000 machines

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,239
so this is roughly an indication

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:29,760
of the size of the open source community

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,720
i guess it will be much higher

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,239
but as mostly in with with free software

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,959
implementations you cannot tell because

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
there is no

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,440
obligation to phone home or to sign a

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,280
contract or something like that

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,440
interesting is if we take a look at the

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,239
distribution of opensuse releases that

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,760
we're having

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,799
and i have here two snapshots from

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,000
about nearly two years difference the

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,920
first one is

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,519
end of july 2018 and the second one

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,360
is end of march 2020.

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,080
um so first of all surprising half a

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,799
year ago

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,760
we still had machines from the 10.2

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,680
release

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,759
accessing the update 10.2 was released

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,040
in december 2006

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,080
which is 14 years ago i think we didn't

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,400
have even

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
smartphones iphones or something like

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,880
that at that time that

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,280
nokia was really a big player um

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,600
so there have been a lot of changes

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,880
since then

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:45,440
so but still half year ago we had about

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,240
16 000 13.2 machines

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,440
which 13.2 which was released in

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,120
november

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,919
2014 which is six years ago

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,639
about half year ago we had still around

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,360
8 000

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,960
machines one reason may be that this is

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,240
the last release

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,720
a sign of tumbleweed that supported the

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
32-bit architecture

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
and then of course we had uh the the

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,000
majority

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,320
of the systems is the

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,600
release that is up to date at that point

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,800
in time two years ago it was 42.3

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,960
half year ago it was 15.1 and you're

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,360
probably now asking oh half a year ago

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,800
why are we not talking about actual

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,919
figures

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,400
uh quite simple in the analysis uh

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:39,039
the 15.2 machines are not yet considered

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,800
so it looks like the amount of users is

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,280
dramatically going down

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
but this is of course not the case it's

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
just that

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,560
um 15.2 is currently

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,080
not in the analysis

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:59,360
quite surprising for me tumblr wheat uh

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,520
we had about 50 000 two years ago

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:06,800
we currently have around 83

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,960
38 000.

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,100
quite stable the amount of tumbleweed

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,600
uses

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,160
[Music]

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,600
i have no idea why the number went down

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,120
maybe later on in the discussion

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:23,360
somebody has an indication for that

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
if we take a look at the box that we're

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,919
having

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,520
per system per release

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:34,560
we can see that the older releases had

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,520
around 2200

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
bucks each and they are mostly closed so

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,160
we have

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,720
two bars here the one is the total

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,759
number of bucks and the other one

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,360
is the green bar is the one that is the

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,120
explicit status resolved

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,039
and you can see those ones that are out

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,800
of maintenance

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,039
the number of results matches

00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,240
approximately the total number

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,360
uh for the current leap release 150 51

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,400
15.2

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,880
this is not the case

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,520
so for these releases that run out of

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,720
maintenance like 15.0

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,599
there will probably be some

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,639
bug closing session in the coming weeks

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,800
similar

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
as we've seen it that fedora does it

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,639
and that will clear the amount of open

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:30,639
box against 15.0

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,880
um an interesting figure would have been

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,240
how many bucks against tumbleweed we're

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,759
having

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,639
um actually i don't know uh because

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,479
i can only query wire the baxilla web

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,319
front and and that limits

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,560
me to about 10 000 records

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,919
and i can tell you we had more than 10

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,759
bucks in total and we had as well more

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,400
than 10 000 resolved

00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,080
so if there is anybody who has database

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,639
success and could do a select count star

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,759
that could maybe provide us with the

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
with the number of bucks

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,960
but here in general we can see the new

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,599
leap release

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,879
brought us a bump in the number of bucks

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,280
but since then it's going down and 15.2

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,080
has only a thousand bucks for the moment

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,800
i i bet

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,960
a couple of them will come but uh in

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,879
general it seems like it seems like the

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,879
the number of bucks is just decreasing

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:38,479
so where do we discuss where are

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,680
our users so first of all

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,600
the largest mailing list

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:48,240
is not on this paper um

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,320
the largest amount of subscribers is in

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,720
the studio express list

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,640
with about 771 000

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,240
but curious enough there is not a single

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,040
email in that list

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,160
so i guess this is the amount of users

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,040
or respectively

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,800
the the users that have been subscribed

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
to studio at the time when it was

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,200
existing

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760
and when it was shut down it was

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,800
migrated to studio express

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,680
and the subscribers have been been

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,720
taking over there

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,000
so the mailing list with the

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,680
largest amount of users is the security

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,320
announce and the announce

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:34,959
list with 2900 and around 2000

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,720
and then we have from the general list

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,080
the project lists

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,560
currently around 694 users which is a

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,880
plus

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,839
of nine percent compared to a year ago

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,760
where i

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,760
took a look for the first time at this

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,240
uh at these figures

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,120
and the opensuse mailing list currently

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,160
has about

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:59,839
1200 users development related

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,360
factory has currently about 1357

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,200
subscribers

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,399
which is a plus of 15.6

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,880
of a year ago and cubic which is one of

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,519
our

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,360
latest products has around 90 at the

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,880
moment

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,519
from the language specific

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,399
mailing list the two largest lists are

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,240
the japanese and the german lists

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,800
and both have

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,320
gained subscribers as well compared to

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,480
the year before

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
and i think this is a good indication

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
that in general

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,360
the open community opens to the

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,920
community is growing

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,160
beside this we have discussion forums

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,550
like the discord channel

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
we have the forum we have

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,279
[Music]

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,200
we have telegram groups and

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,600
i've taken here just as an example the

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,480
discord which has roughly around a

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:03,279
thousand users

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,519
our next question how many members in

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:09,399
opensuse do we have

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:13,120
um and here we are currently

00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:16,240
512 opensuse members which is a

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,240
plus of 5.4 percent compared to the year

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,160
before

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:25,440
and what we try to determine as well

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,279
is the number of contributors

00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,800
into factory so here simon made an

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,480
analysis

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,399
analyzed all the dot changes files

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
analyzed them for the

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,120
for the identities that were

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,279
checking those changes in and we came

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,639
around that we have approximately

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:55,200
3 300 identities

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,200
contributing into factory

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:04,000
i'm saying identities because we cannot

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,240
nail these one-to-one to individuals

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,160
it seems that some individuals have

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,519
multiple email addresses

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,800
so uh let's take it at 3.3

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,920
000 um identities who are

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,079
contributing to to open souza

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,959
and this is uh way more than we're

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,279
having

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,040
members so that means there is also some

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,079
room for improvements

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:33,360
for those contributors who are actively

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,360
working on opensuse to become members

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,519
so what happened since the last open

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:45,360
souza conference last year

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:49,040
in um i think it was in may

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,920
in nuremberg first of all

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,320
we had a change in the chair richard

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,160
stepped

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,360
down gerald pfeiffer

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,560
took over we had

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
two board elections one in january and

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,200
another one

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,959
in august and the

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,839
current members of the board you can

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,959
look up in the open source wiki

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,519
um we have them on the slide

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,160
so currently we have in the board vince

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,880
marina and simon

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,560
the latest one coming in was stussyack

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,040
gerald as

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,959
the board the chair and myself

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:33,519
so towards the end of the year we will

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,720
have another election because the two

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
years

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,680
board seat is over for marina

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,680
simon and myself and

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,560
those ones who have not made a second

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,360
turn now may go for

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
re-election

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,600
wow and if if these are not the ones

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
maybe everybody from the community can

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,880
make up her mind

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,079
his mind or her mind about individuals

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,040
who he thinks that should

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,040
support the board

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
so what else happened since the last

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,880
open source

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,399
conference first of all we had an asia

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,680
summit

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,839
in october last year in bali

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:29,279
that was a exceptionally well organized

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,279
event from our indonesian community

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:37,199
we had it in the university um

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,120
the the rooms were completely crowded i

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,760
guess we had a couple of hundred

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
participants there very many young

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,560
people as well

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:50,079
and it felt like a really good

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:53,600
presentation of opensuse and

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:56,320
the community behind it for this

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,360
year there was already a plan to have

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,760
the asia summit in daily

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,399
already early this year we had to decide

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,600
that this

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,720
has to be postponed to 2021

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,079
due to the covet 19

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,560
problematic and i think if we

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,600
look how things are developing at the

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,079
moment

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,959
we probably have to put a question mark

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,360
behind it

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,399
and have to see how things really

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,800
develop

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:31,920
whether we can do a summit next year

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:34,160
in daily or not one of the last

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,680
meetings that we have for presence

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,720
meetings that we have

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:44,320
was the foster in february

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:46,320
this year in brussels we had a big booth

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,759
many people from the open source

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,720
community were there

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,480
and we also had a very good feedback and

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
that was not only because of the build

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,519
service beer

00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,480
which uh we we handed out for a donation

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,759
and we then dedicated this money to the

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,600
foster organizer

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:09,279
organization organizers um

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,199
in brussels

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,680
brussels was also a little bit the kick

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,320
off for our alignment and networking

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,920
with

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,680
ofe the open forum europe

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,079
that is a not-for-profit

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,199
think tank which is based in bristol's

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,800
brussels

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:31,519
and this is dedicated to

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,920
explain the merits of openness to

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,399
policymakers and politicians

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,040
so if you would call it a lobby

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,920
organization for free and open software

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
it would probably describe it quite well

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,000
and we also

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,680
aligned work closely together with the

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,120
free software foundation

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,880
europe you may have heard the talk

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,519
from alexander sunder today about

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,639
public money public code which is a an

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,320
idea which we

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,720
definitely share then of course we had

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,000
again

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,839
just getting started issues with

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,039
the linux magazine so they are

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,240
bundling a paper

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,240
a magazine with a leap dvd and

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,640
explaining how to set it up and so on

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,160
this is quite handy as a giveaway

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,880
for uh new users um

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,960
especially just to spread the idea and

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,840
to spread the easiness of use

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,840
for for open souza

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,880
what happened on the technical side yes

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,840
of course we had some hundred tumbleweed

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,960
snapshots

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,000
ideally seven in a week which we mostly

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,039
do not meet but nevertheless uh

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,320
many many temple week snapshots we have

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,960
released leave 15.2 a little bit later

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,080
than

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,200
planned because uh there were already

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,200
the ideas

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:04,480
about closing the leap gap and jump

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:07,840
to sum this up again up to now we had

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,799
shared the code basis between slee

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,840
the souza linux enterprise and the open

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,360
souza

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,960
and in the future we want to share

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,679
the binaries as well so not only the

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,360
code but also the build will be equal

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,000
between the sleep packages

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,559
and the opensuse packages so that will

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,360
save us in the end a complete

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,760
code line with all the maintenance and

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:37,600
so on that is required for that

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,360
so the full merge should be done with

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,679
release

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:46,720
15.3 and

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:51,360
an intermediate release leave 15.2.1

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,360
is planned for november if i remember

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,320
right

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,440
probably the one or the other has

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,160
noticed oh i needed a new account or i

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,480
needed to

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,919
to log in again in a slightly different

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,960
infrastructure

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,559
yes we had a significant change in our

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,200
infrastructure

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:18,240
so mainly those areas where

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:21,039
zusa has carved out from microsoft

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,280
focus and opensuse from suse with the

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,160
impact that the forums for example have

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,280
been migrated

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,400
to nuremberg we have all the migration

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,039
of the accounts

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,280
which were still with microfocus before

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,799
to the suse infrastructure

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,760
and the migration of the mailing list

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,480
have been started so we will get you

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,160
mailing this

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,400
set up very soon and this would have not

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,160
been possible without the incredible

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
work of the heroes

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,840
where i would like really send a big

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,919
thank you to the heroes team that did

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,640
really an incredible work and it

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,840
to my understanding i feel it went very

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,240
smooth

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,240
thank you

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:09,360
yeah what has brought done additionally

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,600
we are working on getting more

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,600
openness and getting more transparency

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,480
into that

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,400
one of the major improvements here was

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,679
that we have a new feature request

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,679
process

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:27,039
so that we now can submit feature risks

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:30,640
requests for sleep products as well

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:33,760
which was up to that point in time only

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,880
possible for suse employees and now we

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,640
will have this for

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,640
non-suse employees as well

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,760
the foundation initiative which we

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,360
already

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,919
started discussing years ago and

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,320
getting more in in depth in the

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,440
face-to-face meetings last year

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,400
was announced at the project list we

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,159
left out most of the interim steps but

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,520
came up with the idea to say

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:06,320
let's have a foundation set up for

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,320
opensuse

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,120
because it has various advantages and

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
here it was quite interesting to hear an

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,320
hour ago

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,360
how fedora is set up they are in a

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,799
similar situation as we have it now

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,200
opensuse is backed up by souza fedora is

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:26,080
backed up by red tatters respectively

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,440
ibm so this is an even larger sponsor

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,000
and as the presenter said yeah it has

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,280
pros and

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,039
cons same as we see it here as well so

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,440
we have announced this in the project

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,400
list

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,400
and by intention we hadn't been

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
following up on that to see

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,440
how this is being picked up by the

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,960
community

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:51,679
and here we have to re

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,960
how to say revive this a little bit

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,559
because there was

00:21:52,960 --> 00:22:01,039
shortly a little bit discussion and then

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:04,080
it faded out but definitely it needs

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,880
some distinct people to drive uh this

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,159
discussion

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:12,400
and to drive the development um

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:15,520
i we feel that this should not be driven

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,159
exclusively by the board so everybody

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,520
who

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,679
wants to help here should should step

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
up

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,080
yeah with this i would like to hand over

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,200
to the open source

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:33,600
share yeah chair okay right

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
thank you

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,919
we are preparing for preparing for this

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,200
session i was actually thinking and i

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,799
realized

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,559
in some ways i'm the new kid on the

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:48,240
block i've been

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:51,760
i've been engaged with opensuse

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:55,360
from day zero from what i remember

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,840
even before but the last years mostly as

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,440
a user filing back reports and not

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,840
not intricately with the insides of the

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,840
project like the mailing lists

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,120
um and and all those discussions and so

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,159
i figured

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:16,640
i shared some of the fresher experiences

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:19,760
that the first thing

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,679
i i wasn't surprised but i was surprised

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,000
how other people were surprised is

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,540
actually

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,760
the chair wall is

00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:31,039
[Music]

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,919
subject to interpretation i think many

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,640
people

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,480
apparently at least within suse or

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,760
sometimes outside

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,480
me maybe less on the open suicide

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,200
um tend to think the chair is something

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,520
like a c

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,240
a ceo or cio and i can tell you i

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,360
more escalation sometimes around i.t

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
stuff

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,120
when we had to carve out than our own

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,400
cio probably

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,080
it's not the cfo it's not the cmo i mean

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,480
the closest

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,840
it sometimes feels is the chief

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,640
escalation officer

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,640
which would actually fit into into ceo

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,000
um but really it's an interesting role

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,360
and richard truly can

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,530
can attest to that because there is

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,480
all sorts of expectations and

00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:24,640
[Music]

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:27,840
the only way you can lead is is not by

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:32,400
is not by direct authority

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:35,840
um that said next slide please

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,000
it's an interesting role and it gave me

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,320
definitely a lot more insights into open

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,799
souza

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,880
and the first thing i realized is really

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,000
there is a richness and variety and

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
diversity in

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,400
opensuse that i would argue very few

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,760
people actually

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:58,240
are aware of certainly outside of

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,480
um of that community or communities and

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,400
there is a tremendous amount of passion

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,840
now sometimes this passion leads to a

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,000
lot of arguing

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,480
you know when you have passionate people

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,559
on on several sides of an argument that

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,159
can become very heated

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:18,640
that's not always super um constructive

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,640
there is a lot of openness i found um

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,039
not necessarily always on the mailing

00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,080
lists on the mailing lists when you have

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,279
arguments and sometimes even inertia

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,120
but engaging with people one-on-one uh

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,840
or in smaller groups in particular

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,279
that's where

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,440
i you know when whenever i had that

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,919
um i experienced a lot of openness and

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,640
willingness to engage and willingness to

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,080
to share and help and and and also

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,279
listen

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,520
um and really opensuse

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,559
one of the things that that struck me in

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,080
general is

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,840
is a deep sense of collaboration um

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,520
and opensuse is tricky i've been doing

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,039
open source

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,960
well i started with free software

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,159
because open source didn't exist back

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,240
then

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,640
but i've been doing free software open

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,799
source for more than two decades

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,799
um and opensuse is one of

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,919
definitely one of the more complex

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,310
projects that

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,840
that i'm aware of um

00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,640
[Music]

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,799
for many reasons it's in the geography

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,799
it's just the complexity

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,679
of the different of linux distribution

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,520
but then all the tools that are part of

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,640
opensuse are that affiliated with

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,679
opensuse

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,640
in the in the different communities and

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,640
increasingly things above and beyond

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,679
linux

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,120
which makes this very

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:50,480
interesting very rich

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,000
but also means as open source evolves

00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:57,520
we need to step up next slide

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,919
please um and you know stepping up

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,720
in terms of the infrastructure and and

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
really as

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,760
axel mentioned the last year with all

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:09,039
the carve out susie from microfocus

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,080
on the i.t side opensuse from suicide to

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,919
to a very good extent um

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,679
that definitely has happened but it also

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,360
means things like

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:22,960
gdpr as we move

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,159
towards a foundation probably um

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:30,640
things like finance things like having

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,279
uh even more elaborate

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,080
election rules because as we realized

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,279
this last year

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:41,760
there is there's corner points that we

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:45,520
chronic cases that we actually um

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,240
had not fully covered like what happens

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,240
when

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
you know what happens when the board is

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,039
involved in a conflict then the board

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,520
can hardly arbitrate the the conflict

00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:00,720
directly um etc so there has been

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,880
good progress now

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,799
would i have wished for things to be

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,559
smoother absolutely

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,240
would have wished for things to be

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,880
faster

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:15,600
and farther than um

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,720
then they actually materialized over the

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,960
last 12 months

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:25,279
absolutely but there has been progress

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,120
the one thing um i believe

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,120
and i thought about this what is the one

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,960
thing i really want to suggest to all of

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,480
us

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,799
is related to islands next slide

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,240
as we have the now we have those

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,960
different

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,360
um sub-projects the different groups and

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,480
it

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,360
beat language geographies

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:55,200
interests technologies

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,279
projects etc um

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,960
and in a way those are like islands

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,200
and that can be very nice thing i mean

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,279
indonesia is a is a country

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,520
that exists of thousands of islands

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:10,880
still it is one country

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:14,159
um what sometimes i'm missing is

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,080
is the connection and is

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,720
communications between these islands and

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,240
i i want to be very clear

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,480
i'm not proposing to to use

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,520
tons and tons of concrete and pour them

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,600
between

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,960
all those islands so that it becomes one

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,640
big island

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,760
and you know one completely consistent

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:39,200
and 100 connected um and same

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,919
same island that that's not

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,600
that's not what i think will be healthy

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,799
for the project but

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,600
sometimes i'm wondering you know can we

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,919
use

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:56,559
megaphones or messages in a bottle

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:59,039
or bridges or little planes or boats

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,320
to communicate more between some of

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,120
those it's

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,480
i believe we could we could benefit as a

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,279
as a project or as

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,840
projects plural and as a community or as

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,320
communities plural

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,039
if you were to share more share more of

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,480
our

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:20,840
accomplishments share more of our needs

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,799
share more of

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,480
um what we're planning to do

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:30,640
etc um i have no i don't have this

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,840
recipe where i'm saying okay here is the

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,200
seven steps

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:40,320
here is the schedule um but i'm

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,320
i'm putting out the idea or the really

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,039
the request is too strong i guess that's

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,240
the suggestion for us to find ways to

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,000
to become even better stronger

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,080
in communicating and when i say

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,559
communicating that's internally

00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,679
as i mentioned but also externally i

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,440
think

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,440
we we have some very good activities

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,440
this conference is one

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,000
um we are on social media um

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,480
many of those media actually and and

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,760
there's

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,159
there's local events uh there's people

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,480
attending conferences on behalf of open

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,480
source

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,720
there is members and and others helping

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:24,559
newbies

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:27,120
so there's a lot going on but i still

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,399
think we we could be even

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,039
more we could even do previous slide

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,240
please

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,480
we could we could even do more in

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,519
in sharing in particular of our

00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,840
accomplishments

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,279
and and partly communicating working

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,960
together with other product

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,919
uh projects so

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,279
ramping up communications parentheses

00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,480
even farther

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:56,240
further is one thing and the other thing

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,960
that i noticed is many of us have an

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,640
engineering

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,320
background and much of what we do

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,399
this being an open source project

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,080
resource around code

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,480
one way or the other and reviews of code

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,240
and you know when you review code when

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,840
you review a patch

00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,799
you try to find mistakes

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,760
because even an off by one era can be a

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:26,840
security issue

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:28,080
or a corner case can lead to the thing

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,200
crashing

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,799
but that's about code

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,679
and when it comes to human interaction

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,840
there's something i felt and and it

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,559
actually has a name as i learned

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,480
recently is the principle of charity

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,559
and what the principle of charity says

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,360
is actually

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,519
assume the best interpretation of

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,039
people's arguments

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,159
so when you have an argument on the

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,200
mailing list or in person

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,679
don't try to find the weak spots

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,919
and don't ignore them if they are there

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,200
if they are problematic but don't focus

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:10,240
necessarily on the weak spots try to

00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,880
find

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,919
what the other person actually is trying

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,600
to do

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,039
is trying to relate to you

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,120
even if in the argumentation or what he

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,960
or she says

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,799
there is an off by one error or is

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,840
something you know

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,640
i don't agree with and so that's

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,840
um i was planning to to to send a note

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,399
to the project list

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,399
um i'll i'll dig out some references and

00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,559
and still do that

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,720
but that's that's really one thing that

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,840
i i feel

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,279
ramping up communications even more

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,320
but also slightly um

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:56,480
adjusting how we communicate

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,960
that that really can bring us um

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,240
into the next into the next 15 years and

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,039
and help our journey there

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,799
um yeah and that that was my brief

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,240
excursion with that

00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,040
axel now you can't go to the um

00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,119
next slide please um i'd like to open

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:17,919
the floor i believe i've seen all

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,159
all board members and a fair number of

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,720
other

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,000
people i know by name here on the chat

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,960
and

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,440
in the session so please shoot ahead and

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,560
ask any questions or make any

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,839
comments either live or in

00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,839
in the chat

00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,119
yeah thank you guys yeah discussion is

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
open

00:34:51,599 --> 00:35:02,320
i think you can stop sharing this yeah

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,800
so

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:08,240
i'm going to be the adventurous one here

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,240
and ask the first question

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,520
so gerald now that you

00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,599
are the open souza chairman

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,880
and you know this is sort of your thing

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,040
to be

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,480
for better or worse kind of the face of

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:26,480
open souza

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,599
um my my concern

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,520
has been for a little while now uh

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,040
you know just not from you but from your

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,280
predecessors and stuff

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,079
the the lack of visibility of open souza

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,920
to the greater

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,800
uh community like people don't uh like

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,320
what do you what do you plan to do or

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,839
what do you want to do

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:50,240
to to to try to bring some more

00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,000
visibility to opensuse so that

00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,839
people will know that we exist as a

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,599
community and that

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,119
you know users will come and users will

00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,079
turn into contributors and we can

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,079
sustain ourselves

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,599
going forward because that's been my

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,320
chief worry for

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,720
a little while now with how things have

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,079
been going

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,800
um so to answer is i don't

00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,359
i don't see the chair person i i call

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,160
myself chirp chair person or chair human

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,560
not chairman usually um i don't see the

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,920
chair necessarily as

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,440
they defeat their face of open source

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,920
um i mean he or she certainly is one

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,040
face

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,160
and and maybe one of the more

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,920
more accessible or prominent faces

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,599
um but all members and in fact others

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,280
should not be shy of representing open

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,440
suse

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,440
to be very clear that's not me pushing

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,359
away responsibility

00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,640
um that's just to invite everyone

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,160
um and not make this an exclusive gig

00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,760
um i can and i plan actually on doing

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:05,200
i can do and plan on doing more um

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,839
i mean i started the little amount of

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,160
tweeting

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,599
um actually i increased that um

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,000
it's about tweeting it's about

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,720
interviews um i mean one thing

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,119
that my role at souza gives me access to

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,480
is

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,000
is the press um and

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,720
and that's where i i tend to bring

00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,400
in and up open suse quite a bit in

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,400
interviews when

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,880
um you know whether whether that's a

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,599
topic that was originally requested or

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,359
not

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,280
but i tried to really in open source

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,680
what would be helpful for me and that's

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,680
actually

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,359
the point about communications

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,960
if you and that's you know everyone who

00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,320
contributes something to

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,240
if you help and feed me with

00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,599
by sharing cool things that you do

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,640
um then i can share those things in

00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:06,240
those interviews

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,960
or other um you know internally when we

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,280
when we will get probably um us

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,200
government approval pending

00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,200
uh we will get those new colleagues from

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,079
rancher

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,960
and that will allow me to share more

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,400
right

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,640
um so part of part of my request for

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,079
communications is let's make sure

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,560
more of us know more of the good things

00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,839
and the cool things that we do so that

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,839
we can share them more

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,320
yeah i said neil uh we've started a

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,839
networking part

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,480
uh in the open from europe uh regular

00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:45,040
courts

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,760
and and mailing lists there are many

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,800
many

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,200
users from other open source projects

00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,800
but as well from industry including ibm

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,800
redhead and something like that

00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,359
so that of course raises the visibility

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,720
and

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,839
we've also worked on our connections to

00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,760
media so

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:07,920
i had a longer discussion with an editor

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,119
from the german ct magazine

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,400
uh explaining him the advantages of of

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:18,240
opensuse and he finally

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,280
wrote at least an article about leap

00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,760
15.2

00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:23,440
and that was surprising in that way

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,240
because up to now

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,680
uh the ct magazine knows only ubuntu

00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,640
basically

00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,599
so they're they're very uh resistant to

00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,160
watch

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,040
who said we're working here on there to

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,359
to get it

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,359
get a little bit more visibility all

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,240
right

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,400
that's good to know thank you both of

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,400
you

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,400
as as garrett said basically every

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,800
community member can

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,599
feed us with information but as well

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,839
start tweeting and using social media

00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,960
and

00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:04,079
his private environment or whatever

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,720
um to to to spread the word about

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,720
opensuse

00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,359
i think that another point is to

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,800
interact

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,280
more with other projects other community

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,480
like uh we are doing uh for example for

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,119
uh for this conference

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,640
with the debris office one because it's

00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,720
uh

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,640
it's really normal to have a several

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,760
community members that are

00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,319
in all these communities and the link is

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,839
uh

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:36,960
it's already there we should just uh

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,359
use it and push it a bit more and

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,480
maybe we could get uh better

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,680
interactions and

00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,079
uh yeah also better uh

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,440
contributions i mean i'm just thinking

00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,319
for example to

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,000
uh the tools that we are sharing uh with

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,560
a fedora or

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,280
also with a good library office and we

00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,640
can

00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,200
just grow all together

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:07,839
just learning each other what the others

00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,839
are doing

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:21,839
that's awesome

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,440
i really question what is the board's

00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,280
opinion on

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,760
expanding representation on the board

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,680
where is fully representative of the

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,800
global community

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:40,800
i don't understand that question let me

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,359
let me take that question i think

00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,720
i think the question is around the fact

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,319
that most of our board

00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,000
members are in europe and i would

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,440
strongly encourage in the next

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,359
upcoming election people from all our

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,599
different communities

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,599
to

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,079
consider nominating and running from the

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,480
board or if you're part of a

00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,920
community in a region and you think

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,800
someone else would be really good on the

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,960
board

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,760
i'd encourage you to speak to them and

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,040
try and get them to nominate

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,599
because i think it's something we can

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,119
improve because we have a very

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:19,520
i know personally i've spent a lot of

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,880
time with their community in asia

00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,400
and i would really like it if more of

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,960
them actually ran for the board so we

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,839
could have a

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,839
bigger more diverse

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:34,000
community running

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,760
hey guys i was about to say the same

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,040
thing but i think simon just uh

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,319
highlighted this

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,000
uh hey everybody i'm ish i'm from the

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,200
elections committee

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,400
and i would like to to add some some

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:50,319
information uh

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,000
to answer the question uh we the guys

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,640
from the elections committee

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,560
we do have a lot of trouble to get

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,119
candidates for the board

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,240
so here again i make a request to you

00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:03,520
for the next

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,240
election if you want to see the global

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,599
community

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,920
being represented on the board

00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,040
the first thing that you can do is

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,400
present yourself

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,839
as a candidate or if you cannot at least

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,640
nominate somebody

00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,240
in the local from the local community so

00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,640
that we can you know

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,400
uh at least see in the board that we

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,480
have people from around the world from

00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,440
the different continents from different

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,720
places

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,920
different cultures and uh yeah

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,319
that would be my quote on this

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,319
cheers

00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,680
yeah um actually um the question came up

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:46,640
on on time zones time zones

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,400
um should not be a factor i mean

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,240
obviously it will be a factor but you

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,640
should not be a blocker we have this uh

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,160
this strange aussie here which means we

00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:58,480
have board meetings

00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,599
late evenings german time or european

00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,160
time or early mornings european time

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,920
um i mean have i probably so hawaii or

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:09,280
french polynesia might be

00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,040
might be really tricky but but apart

00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,760
from that

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,240
north america or other parts of asia

00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,880
[Music]

00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,960
wouldn't wouldn't and shouldn't cause

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,560
challenges

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,040
yeah but this is something that we have

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,480
to deal with yeah absolutely

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,760
um you know and we rotate

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,319
um i mean one

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,440
one question that i thought when i heard

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,960
heard the question is

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,000
should we you know have dedicated board

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,200
seats

00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,319
per chill or so but

00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,599
that's also that's also tricky um

00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:50,160
tricky to pull off you know so i think

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,800
the

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,680
the first thing i would i really think

00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:00,319
we should do is encourage and support

00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,319
um behind the scenes maybe um

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,079
people from from other regions and geos

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,720
right now we have two germans on the

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,240
board if i

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,280
if i'm counting correctly

00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:21,920
two germans but five europeans so

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,920
definitely not very distributed

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,560
i'm sorry i mean i asked the question

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,040
but i'm like i don't want to wake up my

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,359
wife

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,359
you know

00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:41,200
but but you know what i'm what i'm

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:44,319
looking at is really

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:45,280
you're all answering answering it like

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,920
you know

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,319
i mean it's obvious we all just want to

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,000
be represented we want we want

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:53,599
the community to grow and it doesn't

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,640
matter where it is on the globe it's

00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,920
just

00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,160
sometimes you feel like

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:02,000
you know how how can we move that

00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,319
forward how can we

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,319
um

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,040
it's just it's one of those things that

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,400
from my side i see it and i go

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,079
you know we have this community here

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,680
this community here

00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,640
and how do we bring that together and

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,000
that that's that's that's really uh

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,520
the hard it's a hard i've got a bit of

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,280
an opinion with that if you don't mind

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,760
me throwing in my two cents to the whole

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,119
thing

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,480
like i think part of the problem

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,920
is like we talked about earlier like

00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,839
misunderstanding of what the role of the

00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:36,640
board is like if you see the board

00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:38,319
as you know representing the face of the

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,200
community or if you see the board as

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,599
as you know leading the project then i

00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,599
think

00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,960
yeah there's a real problem with the

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:48,079
board not being

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,440
as diverse as the community is but if

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,240
you see the board

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,359
as it's charted to be you know as a

00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,960
conflict broker

00:46:53,359 --> 00:47:00,160
and you know troubleshooter you know

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,720
chaos managers then you know

00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,400
the you know the rap the issue of

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,920
representation is something that all of

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,160
our communities can already do

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,440
you know our you know all of our commun

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:10,800
you know all of our communities in

00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:14,240
america in the americas

00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,000
you know in asia they can step up and

00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,160
represent the community

00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,599
now as if they were in the board anyway

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,800
they don't need to be on the board to do

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:24,160
that

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,040
um so so i both kind of get at the

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,200
problem and not

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,640
like you know like i know people see the

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,319
board in that way therefore there wants

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,240
to be the representation there

00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:34,000
but i think that's actually part of the

00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,440
problem like the board isn't made to do

00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,480
that

00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,319
if it if it is then like look at the

00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,400
talk that we had from from ben today

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,680
like yeah if that is kind of the role of

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,280
the board then

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,040
we need to have something that's way

00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,760
bigger way more like the fedora

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
arrangement

00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,400
where you do have designated people

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,079
there for designated roles and you know

00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,640
you have a couple of electric holes in

00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,760
there and

00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,559
that's a totally different scope

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:02,559
charter election process appointment

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,720
process blah blah blah

00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,319
not saying it's either better or worse

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:10,240
just from what we have right now

00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:12,319
i i yeah that's my view anyway

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,559
i think some of the misalignment here at

00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:16,240
least from someone outside looking in

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:19,280
until you know

00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:22,319
richard um helpfully explained it to me

00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:26,640
over beers one night um

00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:30,000
uh the the misalignment here is that

00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,520
uh where the when people perceive how

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,119
the board is chartered you know as

00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,240
richard said it's chartered to

00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,160
essentially be

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,880
dispute resolution final arbiters for

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,000
for people and such they feel that in

00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,040
order for that to be

00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,880
successful there has to be cultural

00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,040
representation

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,720
across the communities that actually

00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,119
open souza is in

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,640
so that this kind of stuff you know

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,359
works out a little bit more effectively

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,720
because

00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,400
of course when you're talking about

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:02,400
people and

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:05,040
you know let's say uh someone from

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,079
india uh has a problem with someone from

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,640
germany

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,440
and and there's nobody who understands

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:13,040
the

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:16,319
indian guy's point of view then

00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,800
it might not it might go badly

00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,480
and so even if we're talking about

00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,520
specifically in the role that the board

00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,200
is chartered to do

00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,119
to be the arbiter of the trademarks to

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,359
be arter of conflict resolution

00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,680
things like that i think people feel

00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:32,000
like it should be

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:32,880
in some ways culturally representative

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,200
so that

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,000
um that function actually can work as

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,400
intended

00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,119
not that it's not working well as it is

00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,680
now but

00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,400
i think some people feel that it that it

00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,800
can't

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,000
because of the lack of representation

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,640
across communities

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,359
again not saying whether it is right or

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,040
wrong

00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:53,760
that's i think where the underlying

00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,760
perception is

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,960
by the way i just want to throw this in

00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:02,480
you know i don't know if any of you

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:04,880
watch cobra kai

00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:05,839
you know like karate kid stuff but it's

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,359
awesome to actually

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,200
actually see the other side of the story

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:11,599
there and no one like

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,400
my generation growing up never got that

00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:15,920
right so

00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,960
like we always took ralph macchio's

00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,319
point of view and

00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,319
he was a good guy but you know

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,800
different points of view really make it

00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:27,839
really make a difference in concept

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,839
resolution so

00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:41,839
true um

00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,599
maybe we should start this this time

00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,920
around we should actually start earlier

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:58,559
for the election and and invite people

00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,119
to think about standing and and offer

00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:02,160
being

00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:04,400
you know i'm sure

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,839
several of the people here would would

00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,599
be willing to

00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:09,280
one have one-on-one conversations if

00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,359
anyone has questions

00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,040
on the board or opens who say how it is

00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,720
to be on the board

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,480
um and put that out to to possibly

00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,000
encourage

00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,680
we should actually be started in that

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,200
process in the next couple weeks

00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,800
yeah oh geez that's right if we want to

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,340
if we want to run the election

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:32,720
on time for the first time in

00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:35,119
[Laughter]

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,160
the first time in as long as i can ever

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,440
remember like

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,280
yeah i'm gonna say i don't think i've

00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,760
ever seen the big rudder time

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,480
i think i think ishi's hair is just

00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:46,480
starting to

00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,839
to stand up steeply

00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,839
he looks a little shocked

00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:12,240
ish worked really hard this year

00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,520
oh we could just fix the process so that

00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:16,559
it doesn't mention the new board should

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,880
start on the first of january

00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,400
oh well i mean now we're talking about

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,520
redoing the charter

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,960
like that's a that's a bigger bigger

00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:26,559
yeah change the charter then you have an

00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,920
election about changing the charter and

00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:32,960
then you can have your election so it'll

00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:35,280
be the first of january 2027

00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,640
i have been i have been in a different

00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,119
organization

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,839
community organization where we had to

00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,040
change the

00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:45,920
charter to make the election happen

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,440
because i think it specified i had to be

00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,559
it had two conflicting things about when

00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,079
the election should happen so we had to

00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,040
have a special meeting to change the

00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,240
charter

00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:56,640
oh my god that's terrible i would say

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,800
it's the year to do it

00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,040
well i mean if everything else is going

00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,880
to happen we might as well do this

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:07,040
right thank you richard we're now

00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,280
apparently going to change everything

00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:10,880
yay can we have the election date for

00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,480
one of those elections like on the same

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,559
as that one in like three weeks time in

00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,800
america just just to really confuse

00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:16,800
people

00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,720
not happening

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:27,280
yeah yeah don't don't be there ruin-ish

00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,240
over this

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,240
i like it

00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,599
i think richard only only is saying that

00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,160
because he knows easter

00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:39,920
cannot simply jump on the plane uh and

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,440
hit him

00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:43,200
for for the next couple of months

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,800
probably yeah but it's gonna be some

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,240
time i fly back to mauritius and then

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,240
like i'll get off the plane and it'll

00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,280
just be

00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:57,040
i i think you deserve it richard

00:53:51,280 --> 00:54:00,559
i do i totally do

00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:03,119
any any other thoughts

00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,119
questions

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,960
seems like everybody's reminiscing about

00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,520
their start in open souza

00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,520
in the chat

00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:28,720
yeah all those youngsters

00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,800
[Laughter]

00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,880
i have so many more gray hairs than when

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,760
i started to open the suit

00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,760
[Laughter]

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,599
hey i joined open souza right when the

00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,599
turmoil started with

00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,760
attachmate and novell just deciding you

00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,400
know we're gonna um

00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,319
do stuff oh those were those were the

00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,200
funniest

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,079
were they i i feel like those were the

00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:56,720
opposite of fun years

00:54:54,079 --> 00:55:07,839
i had a whole like fork ready to go like

00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:07,839
those were funniest

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,520
lupus actually has a rail seven or or so

00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,440
box on his task

00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:17,680
wait a minute you have a thing that's

00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:20,400
not supposed to exist blue bush

00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:22,079
um no it's raw six because i started

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,119
this rose six right

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:27,119
and it was dts and then rh is here but i

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:30,640
got it let me find it i have it here

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,640
but it's kind of yeah

00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,839
okay it's the hammer

00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:40,750
[Music]

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,680
in italy unfortunately so so i'm not

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:46,400
sure if ross seven still had like gold

00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,880
masters

00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,599
you know like actually physical copies

00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,440
but

00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,599
i think that it didn't so this could be

00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,720
the last one is there's still a plastic

00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,280
wrap around it

00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,839
oh my god yes that's a plastic wrap

00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,760
legendary

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,599
of course you can't open it you can't

00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,920
i've got a back in the office in number

00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:11,359
i've got a legendary

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,599
souza 6 box in the plastic still

00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:16,079
i'm pretty sure it's propping my my

00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,079
monitor

00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,960
source a ten point something one and and

00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:35,280
like it was just like a couple of like a

00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,799
centimeter or so like too low and the

00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,480
the souza six one was like it's just a

00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:42,240
bit thicker so

00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:44,880
it worked out really nicely

00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,880
but not

00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:52,000
is showing us i think that's ten two

00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,839
yeah

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,640
time two that i got from a guy that's

00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:01,520
from swedish novell when i updated it

00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,520
from like 10-1

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:11,040
community yes we learned it was released

00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,880
in 2006.

00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,400
if i still if i still had access to my

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,400
office i'd show you my

00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:22,160
