	00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,640
uh and encore you're going to be talking

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,600
about the

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,480
the top 25 new features and not i asked

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,280
um

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,799
you're sharing your screen and it

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,000
digitizes the

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,119
slides a bit so sorry not that you're

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
sharing your camera

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,279
and it digitizes the um quality of the

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,640
slides a little bit so i think if you

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,320
turn off your camera

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,240
you could get better it's tough because

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,279
i prepared a nicer tab

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,960
chameleon chameleon films after

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,239
behind me but yeah okay i will do cool

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,520
thanks okay so i

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,480
i will start because i i believe i need

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,879
every minute of my slot

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
so as uh doug already said my name is

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,360
ankur

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,719
and i'm going to present you the top 25

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,280
new features in just and auto just

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,320
which is a title that encompassed

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,359
several questions

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,800
like first of all what is just well i

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,080
guess most of the audience

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,000
know but anyway it's the installer and

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,720
also the configuration tool

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,159
for all open source linux distributions

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,240
that's

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,600
obvious to say a leap opens us a

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,200
tumbleweed

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
and it's also the installer and the

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,799
configuration tool

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,880
for suse linux enterprise that we

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,040
usually call slay

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,479
and so next question will be well then

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
what's auto-just

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,920
as the name suggests basically is the

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,320
autopilot for just

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,520
so while jas is by nature and

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
interactive tool

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,400
without toys you can perform perform

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,079
unattended installations with jazz and

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,360
unattended configuration of systems

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,680
without

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,759
the need of a human a human being just

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,799
going through all the steps

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,240
so next question will be what do i

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,960
really mean when i say

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
new features like whole recent must be a

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
feature to be included

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,320
in this stock well what i did is

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,759
basically if the feature

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,159
if the filter was already there in leap

00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,360
15.0

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,240
that's it in sli 15 without service

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,080
packs

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
then i consider that feature is already

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
old so it's

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,680
it will not be included so it's only

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,959
scenes that appeared

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,599
in 15.1 or later

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,760
and the ultimate question so what's the

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,440
criteria to select the 25 features

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,920
that's actually the easiest

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,680
one to to answer it's my very own

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,239
personal taste

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,879
so you may be also wondering about about

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,040
the order

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,239
if it's a ranking in which number one is

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,680
like the coolest

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,920
but it's nothing of that that will be

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,959
not only controversial but also quite

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,040
some work

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,560
so i will go just in chronological

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,840
orders or first presenting

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,840
scenes that are not so super new

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,840
i'm finishing with the more recent

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,440
actually the last one is not eating

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,319
in tumble with yet so it's kind of a

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:59,040
sneak peek an exclusive for you

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,040
so since i'm pretty short on time to

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,760
present 25 things

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,000
i will start actually presenting two

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,800
features at once because both are

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,920
kind of um they have like a separate

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,239
purpose which is

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,000
allowing to configure the access to your

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,120
system without the need of using

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
passwords

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,560
uh one the first feature which is

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,159
actually used already during

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,120
installation and allows you to

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,840
set the authentication for the root user

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,840
so

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,159
when you're that's a small animation of

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
the installation process you get to the

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
next screen which is the password for

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,319
root so you can see there that you have

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,440
room for password and also

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,640
for ssh public key it tells you

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,280
that you cannot leave both blank but you

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
could

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,040
you can use both or one or the other

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,599
so in this case if we decide to go for a

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
purely ssh based authentication without

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
the

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,280
password for root i'm not sure if it's

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,840
if you can

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
really distinguish it but well the the

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,640
just already

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,959
uh automatically selects ssh to be

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,120
running and open the port and all that

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,000
even in recent versions and only in

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,640
tumblr with

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,680
we went one step further and if you then

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,840
manually

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
close the firewall it will you will see

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,879
a red alert like okay you have

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,880
passwordless

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,919
root you can only authenticate through

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,959
ssh key

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
you are closing ssh you better beware

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,000
of course you can continue but well it

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,759
will alert you

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
and when you have the system already

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,240
installed you should know that you can

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,120
use

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
just to create users to delete users to

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,960
modify them

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,440
and now you have that ssh public keys

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,440
tab

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,479
in every user in this example we have

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,320
one called admin another one called suse

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,280
and we are just going through each of

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,360
them adding or removing ssa keys

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,320
you could even do it for the root user

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,000
like

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,400
for example in the example that we added

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,320
this as a key for it but we want to have

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,360
another one because we have two

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,000
different people really using the

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
ssh the the root user with their own

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,560
accounts

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
so you can do everything from from the

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,240
just interface

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
and well if you know something about ssh

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
configuration you

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,400
can check that what we did with the just

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,880
interface produce the expected result

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,400
in the ssh directories and also for

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,360
those that are not familiar with

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,039
just though that blue sync you saw is

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,400
basically the just interface when

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,759
running in a console

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,479
because one of the cool features of just

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,600
the all all-time features it's not not

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
new at all

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,039
is that you can run it in in a console

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
and get exactly

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,960
the an equivalent interface to the

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,360
graphic mode

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,600
so another thing that you can also do

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,440
during installation and afterwards

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,400
it's uh configuring the mitigation for

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,759
the famous cpu vulnerabilities specter

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,720
and meltdown

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
that you probably know uh you know that

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
all

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,199
operating system had to introduce

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,960
mitigations for them that that have a

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,560
big impact on performance

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,319
so when you when you're installing

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
opensuse seriously you already have in

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,120
the installation summary in the

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
installation setting summary which is

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,160
one of the screens that you see there

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,120
you see a shortcut so you can

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,600
choose which level of protection against

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,759
i mean protection versus performance

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
you want to configure there are many

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,520
options are perfectly documented in the

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,919
help as you can see there

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,000
and you can you can also tweak it

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,280
afterwards in the wood loader settings

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,720
but you can do it already during

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,520
installation so you have

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
your system perfectly secure since

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
second one

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,960
we introduced that in 50 to one and we

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,160
actually reported to

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,319
to older distributions as well and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,360
another thing we introduced in 1501 was

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,919
an improved

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,560
management for services because well as

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,680
most

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,599
all-time linux users know a lot of

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,720
things has changed since we introduced

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,199
systemd

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,000
so we revamped the whole module module

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
to use well

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,520
concepts like the system targets instead

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
of the levels

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,560
you can configure services to get

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,000
started on demand

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,080
using system d sockets activation

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,919
for each service you can also you have a

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,240
show lock button that will

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,240
show you the existing urinal for that

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,599
specific service and so on and so on so

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,400
basically everything that can be

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,960
configured

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,160
regarding services in systemd can be

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,919
done through just

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,560
since 15.1 another cool technology that

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,120
we also

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,400
made easier to configure is because in

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,000
case you don't know what it is

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,360
it's um a technology that allows you to

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,479
combine a fast disk which are usually

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,880
small because they are expensive and a

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,360
slower but bigger disk into one virtual

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,440
device

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,960
and that virtual device is has the best

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,000
of both worlds so it's

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,800
fast and also big and all that can be

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,400
configured

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,080
through the just partitioner which is

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,440
this special part of just we

00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,720
use we offer to configure raid lba lbn

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120
etc

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,720
and again you can do it already during

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,720
the solution process or of course

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,440
afterwards

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,639
and another just module that we gave

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,759
some love

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,039
for the 50.1 release is the is kind of

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,240
unknown that's what i wanted to

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,840
highlight it here

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
which is the just configuration

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,840
management module

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,759
it had some kind of breach between

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,280
just and configuration management

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,560
systems like puppet

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:30,160
or salt specifically is kind of salt

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
centric because it's the technology we

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,200
use

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,719
more in in suse and opensuse and we

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,360
improve it with support for

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,560
suse managers old parametric stable

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,959
formulas in case

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,719
it's pronounced like that and we also

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,640
integrated better with first boot you

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,040
with just first boot just first boot is

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,440
a

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,800
cool just functionality that allows you

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,480
to um

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,959
configure the system in a way that in

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,320
the next boot usually the first one

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,040
it will open directly just with the

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,760
steps you have configured so the first

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,680
user that

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
uh use the computer for the first time

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,800
will have the opportunity to configure

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,480
things like the

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,880
network creating users and so on

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,279
so another cool feature is and that

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,560
support for installing on raspberry pi

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,959
you may

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
see you may say that actually you can

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,920
install

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,279
many different linux distributions on

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,200
raspberry pi but that's

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,880
not exactly true with other

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,080
distributions you actually don't

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,800
install them you just download an image

00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,279
for raspberry pi and you put that damage

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,399
into the sd card so you basically

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,240
put into your into your pi the somebody

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,080
sells operating system

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,279
but that's not the case with solvency

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
with opensuse

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,279
you just take the standard open open

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
source distribution or the standard

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,959
suse linux enterprise it's not a

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,800
raspberry page image and it's not an

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,399
image at all it's just the installer

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,399
and you go through the process like in

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,320
any other computer

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,839
through installer and xnx you configure

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,160
whatever you want and

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,040
and it partitions the devices and

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,279
install

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,200
and just can do that and also the good

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
thing is that just is aware of the very

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,360
special requirements for

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,440
raspberry pi like the it has to be a

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,320
concrete partitioning schema

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,079
with a concrete type of partition table

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,480
and so on and so on so it will out to

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,000
suggest you the correct settings

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
and if you decide to use the expert

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,760
partitioner it will also warn you if you

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,800
are doing something that is

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,519
not going to boot uh

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,680
and that was already there in 1501 and

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,360
we improve it for 15.2 which is exactly

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,880
the same that happened with the firewall

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,480
d configuration

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,079
so in historically sushi has used a

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,560
firewall called suse firewall

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,279
and suse and opensuse we switched to

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,200
firewall d

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:50,880
in 15.0 and then later we updated just

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,160
to manage

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,920
firewall d so you can do yeah basically

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,279
everything configure the

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,000
the the general settings configure the

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,000
songs or even creating new songs

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
which is very nice combined with the

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,839
ability of just of running

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
of running in a console because although

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,399
firewood has its own

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,880
interface is graphical one but with just

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,600
you can

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,560
basically do everything using the

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,320
console because the

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,519
as i said the interface is equivalent to

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,000
this one that you can see there

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,399
also we improved already in 50.1 the

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,240
error reporting for auto just because

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,800
yeah auto just

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
has kind of an historical problem that

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,920
you when it finds an

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,440
error you can configure what it should

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,079
do but

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,920
that happened that actions are applied

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,240
when the error has already appeared so

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,839
already during installation process you

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,880
have an error okay you can configure

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,240
what to do but it's

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,760
usually too late so in 15.1 since we

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
read it's part of the partitioning

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,959
section with

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,959
the opportunity to add previous checks

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,360
like consistency checks

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,519
it looks like the if what the profile

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,839
says makes sense for your machine

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,079
because the profile is how you how you

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,600
tell auto ask how it should behave

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,680
and maybe you are telling since that

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,120
doesn't make much sense for the watching

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,040
without justice running

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,440
so it will tell you exactly which part

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,680
of the profile contains an error and why

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,880
it worked quite well so we improve it we

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,480
extended it

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,320
for 15.2 also for the firewall

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800
section for the network section and we

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,320
will keep doing it for more

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,880
so about network we improved not only

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,560
that auto just integration we did

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,240
actually a lot of internal work we

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,040
improved a lot of the internals about

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
how we manage

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,880
network and as a side effect of it we

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,639
improve

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,920
we added some small new features and

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,560
improve the interface

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,120
so wireless configuration is better now

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
also

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
the overview of the bond and bridge

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,760
interfaces is

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,279
more clear and the the user interface

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,560
for defining roots was

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,360
really noddex well was not the most

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,240
usable thing so now it should be much

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,360
better

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,079
as it happens also with a support for

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,320
mainframe for s390 systems

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,680
if you have ever used one of those

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,120
system you know that

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,800
there are several devices these are

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,040
extra steps you have to do for the

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,279
devices to be really usable

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,880
and now you can the interface to do that

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,320
is much more usable

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,560
as as well as the udf one

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
so going back to the partitioner so i'm

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
going in chronological order so i will

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
be jumping topics a bit

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,320
uh we apart from the already mentioned

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,560
big cast support we also added a support

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,480
for multi device better fs

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
again i hope you know what better face

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,360
is but if not it's basically a

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,320
file system type that is actually the

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,680
default one

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,160
for most uses of open source honestly

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,720
so apart from offering everything that

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,519
the

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,519
file systems will offer it also has some

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,040
advanced capabilities like for example

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,880
you can have the same file system

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,240
on top of several devices of several

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,480
hard disks for example

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,240
so in that regard it kind of combines

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,279
the features of a file system and the

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,680
features of

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,600
lbn or the features of the software

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,639
right it's something

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,399
yeah something like a mix of a file

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,399
system and those technologies

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,920
and again with expert partitioner you

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,800
can configure such a

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,480
write so called write better fest that

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,240
extends on several devices already

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,240
during installation or afterwards

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,680
okay so more things about the um

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,600
the partitioner uh it has always had an

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,199
a checkbox so you can when you're

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,839
creating a partition or any other

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,720
virtual device you can encrypt it

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,079
but yeah that was all so under the

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,800
surface that was using

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,160
a technology called looks looks one to

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,720
be precise

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,480
but now when you select to encrypt we

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,920
are offering extra options

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,839
for example for swap devices you can go

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,639
for

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,959
a volatile encryption with a random key

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,959
which is more secure but also has an

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,600
impact on ivernation and that kind of

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,920
scenes but

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,440
again you have a very comprehensive help

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,800
that will explain you

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,040
and if you happen to have a ibn

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,959
c series mainframe and you happen to own

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,000
a very specific cryptographic device

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,360
called a

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,240
crypto adapter and that's a

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,079
super cool device that allows like james

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
bond level security

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,480
so it ensures that only the owner of

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,240
that computer with that car and

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,759
configured in the very same way can

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,519
access to the information that was

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,560
written by that computer

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,560
so it's as i said very secure but also

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,560
not so easy to configure but now

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:54,800
you have options for configuring that

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:58,079
there and another security

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,240
feature from ibm mainframes is the a

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,000
secure boot it has nothing to do with

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,480
wifi secure boot

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
i mean from a it has a lot to do because

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,399
it's basically for

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,519
avoiding too good the system by

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,120
untrusted people

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,800
but in general there is a completely

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,680
different concept and implementation

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,519
but we now support it and we kind of

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,360
unified the interface with the

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,199
wefi secure boot because well you have

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,959
one or the other if you have a

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,800
mainframe you are not using wefi if you

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,360
are using web you don't have a mainframe

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,279
so both actually look now similar and

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,320
with the opportunity also to add a

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
shortcut

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,240
in the installation settings that you

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,839
can see there to enable and disable

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:42,000
secure width with a simple check

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,839
and okay so i have mentioned mainframes

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,360
i have mentioned raspberry pi's you

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,759
already know that you can install

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,199
open source away or sla basically in all

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,000
kinds of computers

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,920
but recently we can now install also

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,720
linux inside of windows

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,959
with this famous or infamous windows

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,160
subsystem for linux

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,959
so actual in this case you don't install

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,880
it it's

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,039
really like downloading an image and

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,799
then running a configuration process

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,240
and that's as i mentioned something that

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,400
just can do very well

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,600
because we have just five just first

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,199
boot that does that

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,120
initial configuration process for a

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,760
system so what we

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,160
did was adapting first boot to work kind

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,199
of

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,240
nicely or better than before not say i

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,400
wouldn't say nicely

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,280
talking about windows but yeah it works

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,799
better now with

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:35,760
wsl version one and also we adapted the

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,960
the the control center so it will only

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,520
display the modules that

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,400
really make sense because yeah inside

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,000
wsl

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,600
you cannot do everything that you could

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,240
do regularly so

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,320
it's uh yeah it will only show you since

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,600
that makes sense

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,760
another feature it's uh for

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,360
it's quite specific for suse linux

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,880
enterprise i will

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,880
speed up a little bit so it's basically

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,440
when you install suse linux enterprise

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,679
you have

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
like the base product and then most of

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,960
the software is actually located in

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,240
different modules and extensions that

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,360
you install on top

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,520
some of them require a registration key

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,360
and also you can get software from what

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,720
is called the suse package hub but in

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,520
general you will not find them

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,039
by just zipper because you have to first

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,840
configure the module

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,480
register and so on so the software

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,400
manager

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,240
the jazz support manager now has a

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,240
sibling application that allows to

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,400
search for those packages that are

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,520
it actually relies on the suse customer

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,360
center which is a

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,679
central place that knows all the

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,840
packages so you can find in which module

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,960
the package is and it will assist you

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,000
through the

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,320
registration and so on of the module

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,240
and next feature is a kind of a small

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,760
one kind of an implementation detail but

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,000
i wanted it to mention for

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,320
two reasons so it's basically that you

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,039
have a just module to configure the ntp

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
client

00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,200
and you can ex with it you can schedule

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,679
ntp synchronizations uh so we switch

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,840
from using chrome to using systemd which

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,440
is apart from an implementation data is

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,919
important as a feature

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,760
because now we have better compatibility

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:14,880
with the chromie diamond because his

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,960
chronicles is running our timer will

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
not try to synchronize that conflict

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,320
that we used to have in chrome

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,559
and it's also a nice example of how we

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,600
try to update just

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:27,760
as time permits to do things in the new

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,679
linux way let's say so if you are a

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,559
system administrator using yes you know

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
since it changed

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,080
under your feed well we try

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,480
that just saves you from that which

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,320
takes me to the next one which is uh

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,280
something that you may know that in suse

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,320
and open source we are changing the way

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,720
in which the

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,000
configuration of the package is being

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,960
distributed

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,799
so it's not the longer for every package

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,400
a big file living in etc

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,480
now the packages actually install the

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,640
configuration in user etc

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,240
and then etc will be completely specific

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,960
to that machine

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,480
and will contain only only things that

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
overwrite the package

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,760
configuration but again it's not

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,679
expected to be just a big

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,080
file but broken into pieces like

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,679
it is something d for the server

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,799
something for the service or packet or

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,000
something

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,919
so we are trying to add just to that

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,760
for all the packets that are being

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,000
breaking down into pieces

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,080
so that's good because just will offer

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,919
you a consolidated view so when you open

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,200
yes you see the configuration that is

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,840
really in place

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,320
not just the file on etc or in user dc

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,159
but we

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,960
actually compound the result and that's

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:44,559
what we saw and also we try to write

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,039
educated files between etc whatever dot

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,480
d

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,360
and with a number we some of those files

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,799
were already

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,880
uh splitted for 15.2 so we adapted just

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,280
and we are yeah there are more and more

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
packages changing in time value and we

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,360
trying to

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,000
keep we keep up with it

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
so about keeping up with standard with

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,400
all releases

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,520
this is also another new feature for

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,480
even ibm mainframes again

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,400
this uh if you use these devices also

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,159
these these machines in linux

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,400
there are some extra steps like the one

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,880
i i mentioned for the network it's the

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,280
same for

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,159
storage and other parts so you have to

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,240
do some

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,760
manual configuration in order to use the

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,440
devices in linux

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:34,960
so ibm recently introduces a

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,799
feature that allows to kind of automate

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,400
that but well it needs support from the

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,360
operating system so we introduced

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,480
it it's already available in the quarter

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,919
what we call the quarterly update of sli

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,120
5015 sp2 if you use leap on your

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,000
mainframe

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,840
it didn't make it to leap 15.2 because

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,919
we don't release

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,280
quarterly updates for leap as far as i

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,280
know but if you are

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,799
using tumble within your mainframe which

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,640
can be the case

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:05,039
then that feature should be available

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:08,240
for you as well

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:11,200
so now okay i have eight minutes so i

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,000
i would like to go through some of the

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,760
since we have been

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,320
recently improving in the area of auto

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,280
just because we have uh

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,840
invested some time improving things

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,880
there

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,640
so as i said before the we have the auto

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,000
just profile which is the file

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,799
you give to auto just to tell him how to

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,640
tell it

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,000
how to use just to configure and to

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,480
install the system

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,159
so we have improved the parser now it's

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,840
it reports accurate errors

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,679
in the passive we just said something is

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,080
wrong it was not very polite

00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,880
now it will tell you what is wrong and

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,200
we also

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,880
introduce an alternative syntax where

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,720
you can actually use both

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,480
mixed so it's completely backward

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
compatible that is shorter

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,760
for specifying types collections and so

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,840
on and

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,960
since now we have a validator that well

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,320
it's useful

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,720
we have integrated into the process so

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,240
before even trying to read the profile

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
it will run the validation and we'll

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,280
tell you

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,280
if something is wrong

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,799
again for that profile something that

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,640
many users do is having

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,559
one single profile that then

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,640
using in several different machines so

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,240
they want

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,679
the installation to be slightly

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,679
different depending on

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,840
with exactly machine what exactly decide

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,679
for the disks on this kind of things

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,440
so for that we have dynamic autos

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,000
profiles that you could

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,080
do with a feature called prescripts so

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,880
on top of that now we have a

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,520
build support for erb which is embedded

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,919
ruby

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,440
so you can have snippets of ruby code

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,320
within your xml

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,080
that will be executed and substituted by

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,039
the final content

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,240
and to make that more usable we have now

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,799
a test client

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,080
that will fetch the profile just in the

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,640
very same way that just

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,320
or auto just will do it we'll apply

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,159
rules and classes which is like the

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,120
deprecated way of having dynamic

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,760
profiles

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:08,559
and we'll also use the non-deprecated

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,400
ones with this combining press scripts

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:14,480
and embedded ruby and we'll finally do a

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,520
syntax text and tell you if the result

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,320
is actually

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:23,520
usable for alto yes so

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,480
about generating uh profiles we you can

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,400
do it uh

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,760
there is a module in yes in your install

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,159
system that you can use to

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,279
create a profile kind of a what you an

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,679
editor

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,320
and we have improved it also a lot and

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,240
that's

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,320
all the changes i mentioned about tayas

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,880
are all in tumblr with so far so is

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,400
they are not in leap 15.2 they are

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,000
pretty recent

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:48,320
so um so we improved the interface

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,760
since now we have because uh

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,240
multi-device better effects and

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,200
advanced eclipse job we had to redo the

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,960
whole thing and we

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,320
took the opportunity to improve it a lot

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,440
so that's way more useful

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,200
and yeah we're more powerful but

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,520
most people actually don't don't do

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,600
profiles using that tool

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,880
what most people do is they install a

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,360
system and then

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,120
they clone it let's say they generate

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,520
the profile out of it with that comment

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,120
that is not that common sorry just clone

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,440
system

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,480
the problem is that it creates a

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,240
representation of the full system

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,960
which is usually too much it include

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,120
details that are not relevant so we now

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,000
have included the possibility to do just

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,400
clone system

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,679
target compact that will give you a

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,360
smaller

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,960
profile with all these things that are

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,080
that look really relevant

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,559
like for example just users will used to

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,320
export all the users even the assistant

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:43,039
users it will not do that anymore by the

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,600
way the

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,679
slide is wrong you say it do not export

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,480
non-system user is exactly the opposite

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:53,679
now it will not export system users

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,000
firewall will only explore songs that

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,919
you have edited the service manager will

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,960
only export services that are different

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,880
from the default it is cdc

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,200
also we have improved the compatibility

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,320
with advanced airbn features like

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,320
lb and castlevan raid in the past in

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,039
15.0 basically when

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,880
one of those system was one of those lbn

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,480
setups was found you got a pop-up like

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,520
that one saying that well

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,600
it was a special lbn and the

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,520
number of operation was limited and

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,520
things could even go wrong

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,600
now that's not the case anymore it's

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,919
true that we don't allow to create

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,679
lvn cash with the rate partitioner or

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
lvn raid or nothing of that

00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,679
you cannot modify the setting of the lbn

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,440
rate but you can use it normally

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,360
you can edit it you can delete it you

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,200
can install on top of it

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,559
you can upgrade a system for example

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,440
that is installed off

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,720
on top of an lbn cache if you do if you

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,679
did it manually

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,679
and so on

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,400
and this feature is partly for users and

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,799
partly for

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,880
people creating distributions like like

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,600
richard that will talk after me

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,200
and so we have improved the ways in

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,320
which you can

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,520
configure the layout of the installer

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,039
and also of just first boot because as i

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,200
said you usually install the system and

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,960
then configure first boot to run and you

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,600
give the machine to the machine to

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,200
someone else to do the first

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,520
initial configuration of the network or

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,840
whatever but that

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,679
first wood was not always looking very

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,159
nice and especially was not always

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,480
looking

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,399
like the installation process now you

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,600
can configure it to look to both

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,080
look equal or different as you wish and

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,279
you can

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,520
decide to have a sidebar with the steps

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,840
that are been performing

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,279
either or whatever so it's basically all

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,760
the

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,320
customization possibilities the

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,000
distribution creator has for their

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,440
installer you have it for first boot as

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,240
well

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,799
and okay i was able to do it on time so

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,000
that's the

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,840
last slide as i told you that's a gift

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,600
for you a sneak peek on the feature

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,679
because this feature is still not in

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,360
tumbleweed but basically as

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:12,000
i have said uh many times that

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,799
we have improved the partitioner here

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,039
and there and there

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:16,480
so it has too much functionality well

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,960
not too much but a lot

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,000
so we read the interface and now you

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,399
have that menu

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
where we have put many options that used

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,360
to be in buttons

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,960
so now the buttons are more clear are

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,840
only the buttons that really make a lot

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,159
of sense

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,080
and more esoteric options are in the

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,480
menu and as you can see you have they

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,440
are

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,039
the two volumes for example are

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
represented already in the tables are

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,840
more accessible and easier to

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,159
configure and so on so that was

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,840
all just a quick note i took all the

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,399
information all the screenshots all the

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,000
animation for a from our blog

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:53,520
which is unsurprisingly

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,919
just.opensuse.org slash blog

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,000
and we publish a post every two weeks

00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,320
explaining what we are doing

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,279
and also big posts sometimes explaining

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,720
concrete topics so if you want to keep

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,720
up to date just

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,919
just visit our blog subscribe to it or

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,679
whatever because

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,960
as i said everything this is basically a

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,399
summary of

00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,640
coolest thing there okay

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,720
oh thanks for the league and i'm not

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,000
sure if we have time for some questions

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,960
that's in the chat or

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,799
or richard needs to step into already

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,559
i can give you a minute or two if people

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,120
have questions

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,039
okay the slides well the slides i i have

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,200
loaded to some next cloud

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,520
url i was given i'm not sure what's the

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,640
public url but

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,520
doc probably knows or can say

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,960
more about it i think doug's flipped to

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,520
the other channel but most of the time

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,039
they'll be available on

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:52,799
events.opensuse.org okay with the

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,840
schedule

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,960
and and what you mean with incredible

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,200
lbn like

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,559
logical volume management with

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,720
encryption that's

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,080
perf that's possible since ever you can

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,000
encrypt the

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,520
you can either decide to encrypt the

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
physical volumes

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,200
and then put lbn on top or you can

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,320
decide to encrypt

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,960
every single logical volume on its own

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,600
but yeah

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,960
it's always has always been possible

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,880
that's what i didn't mention it's

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,240
basically you can encrypt everything

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,880
that can be encrypted with a just

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,880
participant

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,840
