	00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,960
ah so let's start

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,440
my name is michal konechni i'm working

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,639
for

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,280
fedora cp team which is taking care of

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,240
the

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,800
infrastructure and building system and

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,600
i'm also maintainer of

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,880
releasementing.org which i will

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,600
talk about now

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,320
okay here you can see so my agenda we

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
will go

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,359
through the basics we will go through

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,519
the

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,239
parts of the radius monitoring and

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,520
integration to package workflow

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,360
the fedora package workflow okay

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,399
here because the americanmonitoring.org

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,200
is actually

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,559
magical world here is the representation

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,440
how i see it when i'm

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,160
writing the blog post about it you could

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,640
read them

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,879
in the fedora community blog i have the

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,079
references at the end

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,160
and above it somewhere is floating

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
part of it that is making the connection

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,239
between terrorism and tuning.org and the

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,040
fedora itself

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,840
okay so some basics what is actually

00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,520
releasemonitoring.org

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,080
it has two application

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,320
one is anita which provides the web

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,680
interface for the users and for the

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,159
admins

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,000
uh you could add projects here you could

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,720
do plenty of

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,640
interaction with it it automatically

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,759
checks for new releases of the projects

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,479
that are in the

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,200
database and it's sending federal

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,240
messages

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,920
when new version is retrieved for those

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,360
of you who don't know what federal

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,280
message is it's

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,520
a message bus used in the federal

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,680
infrastructure

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,159
the second part is the new hotness which

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,119
is consumer of these messages

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,920
and it listens to the images messages

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,759
emitted

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,640
emitted by anika it creates or updates

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,759
baxilla which is your issue tracker when

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,119
new release is found

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,320
so the packager is notified about new

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
version

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,079
and it could even start a scratch build

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,399
for use which is uh

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,239
actually tries if the package could be

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,520
built without

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,720
anything just bump off the version

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,319
uh let's look at tanika where the magic

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,000
is happening

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,720
so stay first some numbers

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,440
first commit into anikia repository was

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,480
28 november

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,519
2013. i'm maintainer of it for

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,560
two years so i don't know uh

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,440
the history of it but i could tell what

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
is happening right now the first release

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
was

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,239
a year later

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,560
it took some time to actually make it

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,560
in something that could be published

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,280
the contributions we have

00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,120
almost 2000 commits into repository

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,720
from above 50 contributors

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,000
we have almost half thousand issues

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,040
the plenty of them are closed

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:17,200
current version is 0.18.0

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,239
uh i'm currently working on 1.0 because

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,159
it's major enough to actually have major

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
version

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
uh the number of projects that are

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,120
watched by releasemonitoring.org

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,120
are above

00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:35,519
126 thousands

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,560
it's more because uh when i looked

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,319
today it's actually uh

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,680
100 projects more

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:49,599
just for the info we have

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,200
to open series we have uh the 300

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,080
mapped packages uh there are

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,480
three three distributions that are

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,360
marked

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,239
open series i'm not sure which exactly

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,920
because i'm

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,680
not really uh watching the

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,680
open ses

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,680
situation and uh

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,440
to compare for fedora we have uh above

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,000
almost 2 000 packages that are mapped to

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
the

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
projects that are mapped to the fedora

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,040
itself

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,800
okay here we can see what you can do

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,919
actually with anika

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,600
say user you could add new project add

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,479
new distribution

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,199
edit project flag project which means

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,919
that you

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
will mark it for the admin to check if

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,880
it's

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,040
correct and you will follow with a

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,400
reason

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,320
you could we could add new mapping

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,880
we could add new mapping which is

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,520
actually the mapping of the project to

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,919
the distribution itself to the packaging

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,240
distribution

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:06,160
we have admin role admins could do

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,800
the things that are allowed only the

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,720
for the users that are experienced

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,440
because

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,560
we don't want the user that will just

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,360
log in to

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,199
delete projects delete the mappings if

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,080
they want to do something like this they

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,680
could flag the project

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,240
the anika takes information from the

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,000
new version checker which is checking

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
for the new version of every project

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,120
that is there

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,759
and you could see anything that happens

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,600
in

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
in tanika it also has libraries io

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,400
consumer

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,919
libraries io is a web that is

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:52,720
watching for the new releases on

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,319
various backends

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,120
and uh this could also create uh new

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,840
projects

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,800
automatically if uh you we are

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,800
interested in the

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,319
inter project that is uh reported from

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
the

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:14,800
consumer and uh anika is communicating

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,840
with federal messaging broker which

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,360
is sending messages about almost

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,759
everything that is

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,759
done in the anita itself

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,319
so the current situation is that we have

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,360
a milestone 1.0

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,639
in work you could see the link

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,199
to the milestone itself and you could

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,199
look at it

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,520
india is also part of the hektoberfest

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
event so

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,840
if anybody wants to help with it it's

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,840
great time to start

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,319
and then we have the new hotness

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,080
this is the floating island in the realm

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,319
of magic it

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,240
creates connection between the fedora

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,280
itself and

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,800
the resmart tuning dot org

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:12,479
first commit was 13 march 2014

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,880
first list was 0.1.2

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,080
not sure why they started with this but

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,919
i didn't want any

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:24,000
older attack in the repository

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:27,360
we have uh for our above 400

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,840
commits from 22 contributors

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,280
of 104 issues

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,039
and most of them are closed

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:43,759
current version is 0.13.1.1

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:46,319
i have 0.2 ready because

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,199
there was some issues but right now i'm

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,240
waiting for the

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,240
staging environment to get back into

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,280
in the fedora infra because we

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,400
we are we finish at the data center move

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,520
recently and still doesn't have any

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,759
everything in tip-top shape

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,919
so here you can see how the new hotness

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,960
is communicating it's communicating with

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,720
plenty of

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,919
external services which is

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,039
why it is relatively

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,000
smaller code based but complex in

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,039
when you need to to do something you

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,240
actually need

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:30,560
plenty of access to external system

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
this is why i'm waiting for the staging

00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
itself

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,760
because i it's hard to actually test it

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,760
without staging environment

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,719
the input to the new hotness is actually

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,360
the message

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,080
uh it listens for the anita message as i

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,000
said

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
it even communicates with the anitya

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
because if there is a new mapping

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,959
created for the project

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
it says it says amita check for new

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,680
version

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,680
and if there is any it just uh

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,519
works with the message for the new

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:08,080
version it's checking with

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:12,160
uh md api which is metadata api

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,920
it's uh to this is uh to get

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,760
information about the package and the

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,519
latest version

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,360
uh we it communicates with pdc which uh

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:27,200
tells us uh if the package is actually

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,720
active uh we communicating with pagyur

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,080
which is uh or uh

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:38,000
which had a talk here

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:41,040
i think or phil will have i'm not sure

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,399
um the pagoor is our

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,720
platform for uh source uh

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,720
source

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:53,519
source git and you can set the

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,920
notification

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
preferences in there and the new hotness

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,320
is

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,680
taking this and see if it

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,160
should just notify the user not notify

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,320
him

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,360
or just uh or notify him and start the

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,920
sketch build

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,800
the scourge build is down in the koji

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,040
which is the

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
which is one of the last boxes you could

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,560
see here

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,360
the koji is your build platform and we

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:24,880
are using it for building

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,600
with every package in ferrura

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,800
uh the last one that is communicating

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,399
with is baxila

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,640
which is creating the tickets for the

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,880
for the bugzilla itself for the

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:40,640
maintainer to see

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,839
okay the current situation is milestone

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:47,120
1.0 same as in anika i

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,240
want them to to be

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,120
more major and it makes sense to have

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,800
them

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,800
both in the same versioning

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,800
uh the new hotness is also part of the

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,760
oktoberfest event

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,760
it's more complex but uh you could

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,079
actually learn

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,920
a few things about fedora infra

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,600
infrastructure if you are

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,079
interested the last part i want to talk

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,680
about

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,120
is the integration to package your

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,160
workflow

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,040
this is where the magic happens and it's

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,720
not that hard but it's plenty of manual

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,200
things

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,279
the packager needs to request a repo for

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,959
new package

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:34,079
this is then created in pacquiao

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,480
then the component is created in baxilla

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,680
which allows the user to actually

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,600
receive

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:45,600
anything for the package any issue

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,120
then he creates project in the anika

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,160
and if there is a new version

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:56,160
it notifies the new hotness and new

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,880
hotness creates a ticket in baxia this

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,200
is the

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,800
this is not the wall package of workload

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,760
is just part of it

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,000
just the one that is uh actually managed

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,720
by tourism.org

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,690
okay i have some demo i hope it will

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
be global interstate

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:17,279
[Music]

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,279
ok

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:30,480
okay could you still hear me

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:33,519
or do i talking to myself

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,079
i can hear you you're fine okay

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,360
fine you're doing well man yeah i'm

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
surprised you know you're

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,639
everything is uh working despite you

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,320
know what you said was a poor connection

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:49,040
uh i wasn't sure this is why i uh

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,560
as i said i'm just in some parking lot

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,600
so

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,920
it's not really uh

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,480
you can't really see uh know if there

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,200
will be good connection

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,399
okay can you see the anika right now

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,440
yeah

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,639
okay so this is the ninja this is what

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,839
you will see

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,320
if you will connect to it

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,399
i just have few options that are not

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,880
available to

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079
to the users just uh then there's my

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,320
user management and

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:25,760
flag system this is only for the admins

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:28,800
to see as you can see

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,680
there are more projects than i just said

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,480
because

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,480
the projects are

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:38,720
are created day to day i

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,000
tried to get some stats today and i

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,000
found out that

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
we are creating uh 10 projects per day

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:54,639
in most most of the time

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,480
it's uh more or less but

00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:03,279
then it's a good number okay you could

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:08,560
search for any any project here

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:12,800
okay here you can see it zero id project

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:15,920
uh here you can see the flag button

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,920
the latest version

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:39,920
development which basically uh justifies

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,040
the um motivation to test earlier so

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,040
basically yeah for

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:48,160
here if you find the issue

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:51,760
design thing design phase

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,320
basically one and then ibm has

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,320
calculated

00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,880
basically of bug fix um

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,920
when the black was identified during the

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,240
implementation

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,519
here also the uh because uh this

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,800
basically

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,639
is um have plenty of back end support

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,680
that back end is actually the platform

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,120
where the project is hosted

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:20,240
it could be it could be anything

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,440
the most used is the github

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:28,560
as i'm ever you could also have

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,560
bhagur pi by drupal

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,680
there is also some option to

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,000
to have your custom as you can see here

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,480
the custom allows you to set a

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,199
page that will be checked as you can see

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,639
here

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:47,759
below and you could set uh

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:51,360
some uh regular expression

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,680
to use for the testing you could see it

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,720
here

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,120
this is the annotation of the project

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,120
i will show you how much begins we are

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,639
currently supporting

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,800
you could use anything that is here

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,680
most of them are that menu does not show

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:12,399
up in the screen share

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:15,440
oh the drop down is not not showing

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,040
yeah i don't think the firefox um menu

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,120
drop-downs actually overlay

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,360
inside of the window so they're not

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,720
being captured by your

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,079
start oh okay nothing happened

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,040
uh we have above

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,199
around 20 supported back ends so you

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,279
could choose from plenty of them

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:41,040
the version scheme allows is how you

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:44,480
tell the anita how to sort the versions

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,839
uh we have currently treated the rpm

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,600
which is which is used by

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
most of the projects because it was the

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,399
first one

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,959
and it is the same that is actually used

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,959
by the

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:02,000
rpm packages we also have a

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:06,240
semantic support and calendar

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:09,919
of scheme the calendar scheme has some

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,919
changes that you could

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,039
you could provide a pattern for the

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,880
version

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:20,240
that is based on the calendar versioning

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,720
system okay

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,160
we here we have version prefix version

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,120
prefix is actually

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,880
just a part of the string that is uh

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,400
removed from the version

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:36,480
before it is sorted

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,320
so if you have a version prefix set by v

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,840
you could just type v into version

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,559
prefix and

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,559
the v will be removed before the sorting

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:52,160
okay there are two options here

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,120
the using secure connection there are

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,640
some webs that

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,039
doesn't like https so we allow you to

00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,919
just

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,080
uh bypass this and the checklist this

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,520
release on submit is actually

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,840
uh check doing the check ma

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,760
after you submit the changes i will not

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,360
do this right now so

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,400
will not do any changes okay

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,280
so as a admin i have uh

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,520
ability to delete the projects and here

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,919
below you can see the mappings

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,799
so you can see there are three fedora

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,240
pinks

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,919
to 080 this means that there are three

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,960
packages that are

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,080
uh using uh that should be notified when

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,360
this project happened

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,520
has new version uh and there are other

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,880
distributions that are

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:46,960
uh that are have that have any any

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:49,840
uh mappings here uh there are

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,640
i even heard that uh some of them are

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,919
even using

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:56,400
the messages that are uh that are

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,200
emitted by anika and just uh

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,919
trying to use something that is same to

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,960
the

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:07,039
new hotness okay so

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,320
let's look but there is a

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,440
quick reference docs so you could

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,480
look at the docs every time i

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,960
enter 1.0 milestone i want to

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,760
actually enhance the documentation

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,120
because it's

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,400
pretty updated right now you can look at

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,440
all the projects uh

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,480
as you can see there are plenty of them

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,080
even just with uh with the

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,080
numbers okay

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:42,559
here is the list of distros uh

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,240
let's look at the open shoes

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,600
as you can see there are three open

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,080
seals distribution

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,559
opensuse opens you sleep and opens you

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,360
stumbleweed

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,679
we could actually look what is mapped to

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,000
the

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,720
to this this drawer so you could check

00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,559
what

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,559
packages we actually have here

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,360
you could you could add a new

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,679
distribution

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:13,039
to this form

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,840
that is linked here just

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,799
add the distribution name and if it's

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,000
not there

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,480
you could add it otherwise

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
if you creating a new mapping uh you

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,039
will just uh

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,400
you will just uh take the distribution

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,720
from to drop down

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
this is because we had plenty of distros

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,240
that were just the

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:40,159
typos of others like fedora or

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,360
fedoran or something like this

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,559
okay the last thing here

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,240
i will show is the up the projects

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:54,080
you could add projectors everybody who

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,520
just have fast account or some iphone id

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,400
could join here and add their own

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,440
project

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:04,880
and just get notifications

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,919
for them by listening to the messages

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,679
that the

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:13,679
anika is emitting

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:16,159
okay let's go back to the

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,600
there's a question from the audience um

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,039
what does the default

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:24,080
regular expression mean oh okay

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,760
default regular expression this is uh in

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:30,320
the

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,360
okay let's found some project it's

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,880
uh that regular expression that is

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,400
used for you know if in case

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,159
you don't do don't have anything into

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,480
regex

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,559
if there is no nothing into regex it's

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,720
use the default exp

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,720
default regex so

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:58,320
this is just uh for you to use uh

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,640
to um it should cover most of the cases

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,360
but

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,360
if it doesn't you can provide your own

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,240
okay

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:16,320
let's just return back to the

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,360
here you can see some references the

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,480
slides are actually in the schedule you

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,760
could look at them

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,360
there is a link to the speaker deck

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:31,039
and you could look at them in

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:35,760
in quiet if this was too fast for you

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:38,840
i have few links that here i want to

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,159
share the blog post for the

00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,880
racemonitoring.org

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,520
i'm writing i'm at least trying to write

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,000
regular uh blog posts about there's

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,960
moretoning.org

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,840
there are 10 of them i'm trying to have

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,840
them in the

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,360
in the magic kind of magic board

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:06,799
so every one of them

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,080
is uh based on the on some

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:11,039
magic things it could be funny for some

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,159
to read

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,559
i even got one response that it's

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,280
too difficult to read because of this

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,240
but

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,559
it depends on the on the reader and this

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,080
is

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,960
why i probably you noticed in the

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:31,320
recording i had the wizard ahead

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:34,320
on so this is why i'm the mage from the

00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,320
releasemonitoring.org

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,039
the second link is for the

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:41,600
releasemonitoring.org itself

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,240
and then there are two repositories for

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,919
the

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,200
actual applications anika

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,400
and the new hotness

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,240
you could look at them we welcome every

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:58,240
contribution that you make

00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,960
it could be anything small or big

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,240
we even had one contributor that

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,120
returned

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,480
for hectoberfest and finish it one

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,400
request that was there

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,880
for i think one year so it's nice to see

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,360
that

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
any anybody that is returning to the

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,880
work

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:22,720
to do land they they know

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,840
and this is actually everything from me

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:33,840
so i thank you and if you have any

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:33,840
questions i think we have some time

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,400
okay i will look at

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,200
okay do we have any question

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,640
you could even write it in the chat

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,840
yeah i have a question for you

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,440
okay how would you compare your project

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,600
for instance with uh for

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,279
uh reapologies if you're aware of that

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,640
project

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:06,480
okay yeah i'm aware of it

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,480
i'm i was looking at it

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:16,320
i didn't use it too much i just look uh

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:19,039
at home it works the main uh

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,320
the main difference between uh to raise

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,200
mountain.org and

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,080
auto solution is that the smoothing.org

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,120
provides

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,240
you with the way to actually

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,240
create a custom pro custom projector

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:37,440
with custom check so um

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,000
i didn't saw and didn't saw this in any

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,120
other

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:45,039
project and as i

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:48,400
that in the time the anita started to

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,919
shape there wasn't any uh

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,640
anything uh else that could be used for

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,720
this so

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,720
fedora created their own

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,200
great thanks

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,039
in the in the chat is asking if there's

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,720
some overlap

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:16,000
for or some potential for

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,159
co-op or leveraging uh

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,640
um release monitoring for the back end

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,679
of software.opensouza.org

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,840
right let me give you some

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,679
like background why i'm asking like i'm

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,440
currently the only official maintainer

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,799
of the project and you know we have full

00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,279
backlog and nobody

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,960
is developing these features so you know

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,320
if we could hook it up together or

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,240
something that would be like

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,080
you know it would ease up the pain on

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,279
our side

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:47,440
yeah i'm open open to any

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:51,039
uh any uh work together

00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,640
so yeah this is no problem uh i even had

00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,919
someone from the

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,960
open seas community i'm not sure what

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,159
it it was i think one year ago

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,919
who wanted to help with the new hotness

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,360
and use the new hotness for

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,840
opensuse packages

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,640
yep the most interest currently based on

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,600
the issues that we

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,360
we have open is on the search engine so

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,880
um i will probably discover you know

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,559
like what we can do

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,240
on your project and see if there would

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,600
be you know if these features would be

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,919
basically asking what you have that

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,000
would

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:29,919
kind of help up decision making

00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:32,480
yeah okay this is uh no problem to

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,960
you could look at the anija code and

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,360
look at

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:41,360
what we have on how we use it so

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:49,840
yeah it's actually

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:49,840
open so yeah thank you very much

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,919
yeah um i see

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,960
uh some uh note from from brad in the

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,360
chat

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:03,440
uh i really like this concept our

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,679
package packages typically are struck

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,520
with their own methods of keeping track

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,200
having a single source of truth will be

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,240
handy um

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,240
there is one

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,799
not a really bad thing on uh

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,240
release monitoring router but there are

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,200
some problems with the

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,559
projects that are actually changing the

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,840
version scheme

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,679
or are some strange

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,240
uh have some strange uh uh

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
version conventional hosting yeah the

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,080
version dimensioning but uh

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,600
even the hosting there are some projects

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,720
that even the custom

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,720
backend couldn't actually

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:49,919
font new version of i saw a few of them

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,520
i even saw a few projects that are

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,799
that were actually used tax in github

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,520
uh or on in git for something else than

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,760
just releasing so

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,200
it's hard to actually know what is a new

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,080
version if you don't

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,440
know the context and it's hard to

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,799
provide the context to

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,000
applications sometimes

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:17,440
so yeah uh if you can

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,480
actually uh want uh if you can

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,320
create the project easily into anika if

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,520
it's a hostel on github it's

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,880
mostly just uh creating the project

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,960
or on some on rubygem on pi by

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:35,760
and if you see um

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,480
if you will create it it will just emit

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,360
the messages

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:43,840
i there was some request for to have

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,039
even something else than just fedora

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,559
messages

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,520
but uh i didn't have time to

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,120
actually look into it but it will be

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:57,120
nice to have

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,799
something else for someone outside the

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:02,159
fedora messaging but the

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,679
writing the consumer is not that hard

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,240
they are good documentation for it

00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,200
yeah um i actually have a question for

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,440
you michelle

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,279
um uh so the opensuse infrastructure

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,360
operates off of amqp

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:22,000
uh would it be possible to

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,159
get uh fedora messaging messages

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,919
brokered onto the open souza broker for

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:27,919
its infrastructure to do stuff with it

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,039
i as i know the federal messaging is

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,640
rabbit mq which should be built above

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:39,200
the imqp

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
so i think it's possible we have rabbit

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,760
mq in the fedor in the in

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,840
open sousa infrastructure as well

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,120
okay so i think it could be possible but

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,480
i'm not the one

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,840
who working with the terabit mq so

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:57,120
it needs to be directed to

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:59,279
our boom part or someone who is

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,320
now who is working on the fedora

00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:03,279
messaging

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,320
itself because they know about the

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,360
setting of the

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:12,240
