Title: Uyuni: the solution to manage your Linux infrastructure
Publication date: 2020-11-05
Playlist: openSUSE + LibreOffice Conference 2020
Description: 
	Configuration management, content management, patch management, compliance, building images & containers, virtualization... you name it! 



Uyuni is a software-defined infrastructure and configuration management solution. It bootstraps physical servers, creates VMs for virtualization and cloud, deploys and updates packages -even with content lifecycle management features-, builds container images, and tracks what runs on your Kubernetes clusters. All using Salt under the hood!

Uyuni provides you a high-class frontend solution to interact with Salt, manage your states, formulas with forms, and much more using a web UI. Or you could use our APIs.

All the major Linux distributions are supported: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, CentOS, Oracle Linux and we have reports of Fedora.

Uyuni is open source, backed by SUSE and actively developed.

This presentation will give you an overview about Uyuni: where we are, what's next and how the community could help (hint: some features are not -yet- supported on some Linux distributions). A demo of Uyuni with several different client operating systems can be included if time allows.
