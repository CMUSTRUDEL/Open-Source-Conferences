Title: Getting started with Podman
Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: openSUSE + LibreOffice Conference 2020
Description: 
	Learn about containers & what they are made of... 



Podman is an open source container management tool that allows the creation and management of OCI compliant containers. In this presentation, we will cover quick basics of containers, get an overview of the building blocks (e.g Linux namespaces), look at the OCI Image Manifest Specification and conclude by looking at a few Podman commands that will enable us to build & run containers.

The presentation will be an improvement over the previous presentation which I did for the openSUSE Asia Summit about openSUSE MicroOS - Managing Pods & Containers. It will borrow some ideas from the previous presentation and then build up on those for users to have a better understanding on how containers are able to do the magic that they do.
