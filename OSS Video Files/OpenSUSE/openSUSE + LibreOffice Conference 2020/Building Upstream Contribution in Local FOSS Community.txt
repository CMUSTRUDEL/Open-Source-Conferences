Title: Building Upstream Contribution in Local FOSS Community
Publication date: 2020-11-05
Playlist: openSUSE + LibreOffice Conference 2020
Description: 
	Based on openSUSE and LibreOffice Community in Indonesia 



Not all members in the FOSS community willing to contribute to the upstream project. Most of them are end-user and enthusiasts, and the rest of them are contributors. Not all contributors are tech-savvy, they also do the non-technical stuff. Based on experiences in the local FOSS community, bring the local contribution to upstream is really challenging. In this session, I will share some activities, both in the openSUSE and LibreOffice community in Indonesia, to build up contribution and engage with the upstream community.
