	00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,759
so okay so uh

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,480
good morning everyone my name is patrick

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,280
fitzgerald ceo of required magic

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,759
um we do a whole bunch of different

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
things

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,480
uh consulting uh right software that

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,920
sometimes doesn't work like

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,480
we were all experienced on

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,480
thursday

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,599
i'm here to talk about firebird not

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,960
necessarily its integration

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
with with libreoffice which is a great

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,480
thing

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,880
um but my experience with it and i guess

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
i was

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,079
very surprised when i discovered that

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,920
have been integrated

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,320
um so let's just step through that

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,200
so i mean really what's the database

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,160
that's gonna be the first thing we'll

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,520
talk about

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,039
um and why it's all so great uh what

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,039
what's in the base in the first place

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,559
and where did firebird come from

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,440
they're all related um and

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,480
what's good about it um well it's not

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,800
it's not access

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,000
um and i'll just step you through our

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,760
used case

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,200
and why i'm a fan of this particular

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,320
database um

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,479
and we'll race through that

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,840
any questions feel free to ask at any

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,040
point and i'll try and get to them at

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,320
the end

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,200
there's only 15 slides so in my

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,799
experience i

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,799
zip through presentations

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,200
so what's a database it uh

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,479
uh was not a big spreadsheet although it

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,799
kind of is

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,799
um but if someone knows the definition

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,640
of it please tell the uk government

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,759
because uh that was a massive news item

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,720
uh over over here in in the uk

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,680
um where they had some automated process

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,600
that was

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,119
injecting millions of records not

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,720
thousands or what let's just say

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,079
hundreds of thousands

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,759
of records and somehow you know

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,280
they thought that the the ultimate

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,040
target for this was going to be a

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,520
spreadsheet

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,560
and uh and well

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,879
excel run out of capacity according to

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,800
the contractors that built the system um

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,720
and yeah so there are other ways to do

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,120
things rather than spreadsheets

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,000
especially excel spreadsheets

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
um so what's in the base interbase is

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,599
something that i came across

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,400
in the late 90s yes i'm that old and i'm

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,400
even older than that

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,640
i had a project that was working

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,400
uh we're building a job tracking system

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:47,440
um i was a fan of

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,879
pascal and object pascal at that point

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,040
so we bought the borland uh delphi

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,120
studio enterprise which

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,319
luckily came with this thing called a

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,599
sql database

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,959
which i had heard of back those back in

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,480
those days

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,360
mark and microsoft steve is just

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,239
it was just starting out having having

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,480
them

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,840
with microsoft having uh worked with

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,319
cybase

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,360
um and sidebase started around the same

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,400
time

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,879
as as interbase corporations started

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,519
um but uh cybase started with millions

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,159
of

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,560
dollars worth of virtual venture capital

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,319
uh

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,519
whereas uh interbase was started as a

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,920
as a garage startup

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,879
so what did this little database

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,879
actually do

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,159
um it was incredibly advanced for its

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
time it had

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,040
its multi-architecture it ran on just

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,159
about anything at that time

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,080
um all written and see

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:55,920
um it had api ticket

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
triggers it had stored procedures

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,319
you could call external code so you

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,799
could you could have things that would

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,959
write uh stuff directly to the file

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,120
system if you wanted to

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,720
um and of course you know as i said it

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,879
was free it came free

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,560
for enter with delphi enterprise so we

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
had a license for it so why not started

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
using it

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
and it's it's got a long history it's

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,919
the development started

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,880
of this particular product started in

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,880
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,840
and you know it's got some

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,919
interesting interesting facts

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,639
associated with it um now apparently

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,520
it was designed as a targeting computer

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,040
for the

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,680
for the m1 tank

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,320
which now physicists in the audience

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,440
please

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,440
correct me but

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,840
it was built into into the tank because

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,759
of the targeting system

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,840
would reset every time the gun was fired

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,759
and they had to come back up online

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,960
immediately or as

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,479
rapidly as possible and without any

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,160
database corruption

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,080
now some people have speculated it was

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
to to keep

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,680
track of the number of rounds fired by

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,039
the gun but i think it was actually more

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,960
more sophisticated than that it would

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,960
have been some something

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,880
such as some sort of radar readout or

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,960
something for target sensing um

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
and apparently the gun would be fired

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,960
and it would

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,479
i would imagine it was just shock the

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,600
vibration would probably reset the

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,600
computer

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,479
um but i've also been told there's an

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,320
emp pulse an electromagnetic pulse

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
uh that would just basically reset the

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,759
computer every time the

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,880
the gun was fired because obviously that

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,960
it wasn't adequately

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,240
shielded not sure if that about that's

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,360
true but that's

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,560
what i've been told so it was built to

00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,160
be highly reliable

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,639
which is the key takeaway it's

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,039
compact so the database will fit in a

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,440
single file

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
it's accessed via a connection string um

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,319
by the client

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,440
by the client that's accessing it um

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,639
the binary sits in in three meg or back

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,680
in those days sat in

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,720
in three meg of ram and three mega disk

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,000
spaces as well

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,880
so the entire installation is extremely

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,560
compact and and it builds databases that

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,319
are highly resilient to

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,520
power outages um any kind of

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:38,639
failure of of the infrastructure

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,240
it's almost guaranteed that the the

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,680
database will be intact

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,520
um and that's more than i can be said

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
for a whole lot of other databases that

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,120
i've used

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,880
um not naming any names but i think

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,880
probably a lot of us have gone through

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,400
uh database recoveries uh with uh

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,000
varying degrees of joy shock horror

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,919
and tears but this particular

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,599
database we've never had any problems

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,360
with it

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,560
so what's uh what's firebird then if

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,759
that's interface what's firebird

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,319
well there's a big there's a big a

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,479
a long of a long history a little bit um

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:22,880
like sousa actually in terms of

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:26,560
different ownerships of the company um

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,759
and around at some point in the in the

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,479
late 90s interbase was acquired by

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
ashton tate and then ashton tate was

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,240
acquired by borland and then borland

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,280
decided that they were going to spin

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
the interface arm of the business out

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,880
into

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,720
a different company take it public uh

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,160
open source it you know do all the

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,080
trendy things that

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,919
that linux was just beginning to make

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,440
possible uh popular

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
in terms of the investment community

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,039
but in year 2000

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,800
the the bubble burst uh the the

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:08,319
inventor capital funding collapsed uh

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,199
ipos public offerings of companies

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,080
collapsed

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,280
it was a big problem um that's partially

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,319
because

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,960
mixed mixed up with the with the

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,919
build up to year 2000 and possibly what

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,759
might have happened

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,400
which was bringing in lots and lots of

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,960
consulting dollars

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,840
the the whole internet had been as

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,919
everyone thought

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,479
had been overhyped um and

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,279
a lot of uh a lot of companies have been

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,760
raised

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,479
and and had burst and a lot of companies

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,919
went down

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:47,680
at that point but for a little while

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:51,680
for a little while at least the

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:55,120
the interface source code was open to

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,279
on a repo and so a bunch of developers

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,640
including the elite developers

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,800
resigned from borland uh and

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,720
resigned from internet uh interbase

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,440
software corporation as it was about to

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,600
be

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,800
as was named and basically took all the

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:15,760
brains of the business

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,800
uh away and at the same time they

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,399
they took a copy of the open open

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,440
licensed

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,279
software you know the the source code

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,040
um and i announced the

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,640
the uh birth of a new company called

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,200
into a firebird

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,160
a new a new project called firebird near

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,399
the sequel

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,920
um and at that point interbase went back

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,839
to closed source you can still

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,279
buy into base there it's a completely

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,200
different product now

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,240
um but fire burn but firebird was born

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,640
from that point

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,800
um and it was just a small window where

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,920
the source became available

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,920
the authors left and created something

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,720
else new

00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,440
and and they released about six months

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,680
later

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,279
version one of firebird and at that

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,040
point it supported linux

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:10,160
when windows solaris and hp ux

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,640
um so why it's so good what's it what's

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,360
really good about it well it's very good

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,460
about it

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,959
with embedded systems

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:20,480
[Music]

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,360
if you look at the repos on

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,839
just about any flavor of raspberry pi uh

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,800
build

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,800
you will you'll see it's it's there um

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,760
but it could it could potentially fit in

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,839
smaller architectures and that

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
um i i guess it could be it could be

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,399
built um

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,760
but really now the the the smallest

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,839
possible

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,480
compute size uh realistically

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,839
where you can run linux fully is

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,600
raspberry pi

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,600
um i could be wrong there um

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:59,680
if you need if you need a

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,600
software that that maybe uh you're

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,839
delivering to a customer or to a

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,600
to a device or as an architecture that

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,760
you need a maintenance free data store

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,959
you just need to keep your data in there

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,000
then that's that the firebird is the

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,120
perfect choice for it um

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,640
it's uh sql lite is good

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,640
but i would say that uh given that it's

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,120
it's not really it's designed as a

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,079
single user data store or database

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,640
whereas uh firebird is from the very

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,680
very

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,680
ground up is a multi-user and can allows

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,480
concurrent access

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,079
uh good for data collection unattended

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,399
systems

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,519
any other multi-user system where a

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,200
bigger database

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,560
postgres mysql others oracle whatever

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,880
uh microsoft overkill and

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,680
you just don't want to a put the

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,800
licenses

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,600
like licensing dollars into it or the uh

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,959
the maintenance into it um so something

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,079
like a

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,440
a kiosk a web kiosk would be perfect um

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,600
and of course it's very good at not

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
being microsoft access

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,279
um which was something that we

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,079
considered in a

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,079
once and i know other people haven't

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
regretted it so

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,360
so our use case

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,959
back in the late 90s had a company

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:30,079
called the ocean web digital

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,880
and we had a drop we were thinking of a

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,399
way to track

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,000
the work we're doing for a number of

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,959
customers

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,920
we were doing the a lot of work with um

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,240
with a variety of customers in fractions

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,880
of

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,000
of a day so we'd be working with a with

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,079
a lot of small business

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,200
and as as their outsourced i.t

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,720
department

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,680
um so i set about designing

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,760
this system um thought from the outset

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,360
that it should be

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,000
a cgi um server that would deliver html

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,399
to the

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,680
to wherever people were logged on so the

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,160
customer so

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,600
if an engineer was at a customer site we

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,519
could build something

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,959
we could we could bill it uh then and

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,440
there and custom and the

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,760
engineers could write notes into the job

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,480
into the work request or wwr as we call

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,920
them

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,399
um and everything would keep

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,079
would be uh that the time taken to do

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,920
the work would be

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,240
would be uh tracked and plus a desktop

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,880
uh

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,360
windows app i should say uh for accounts

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,000
that injects invoices into sage accounts

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
at the month

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,760
end um so that that in that case it uh

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,880
automated the

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:45,440
billing process so all the accountants

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,399
uh all the bookkeepers press a button

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
and

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,720
uh invoices would just be spat out by

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,480
by sage but from 19

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,160
so it lasted for about 10 years but it's

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
beginning to need a refresh we need to

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,519
put

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:02,880
more in it and really um

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,720
looking at that kind of level of code

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
which is not lines of codes but each one

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,079
of those little icons has uh

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,800
probably several you know hundreds of or

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,519
dozens of lines of code in it um it

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,639
became

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,959
a bit of a nightmare so

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,480
complexity had taken over as of just a

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,680
fraction of the rd chart

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,399
um so we came up with a solution

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,079
called which we found in django and i'm

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
not sure if anyone there has

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,399
had experience with django uh it's a

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,399
fantastic

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:39,600
um web web front-end

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:42,399
back-end combination framework

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,680
and they had this little command called

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,399
inspect db

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:50,240
and what inspect db would do is it would

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,079
you point it at a database if you got

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,040
the the driver for it

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,000
um and python had some guys had just

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,360
developed the python firebird driver

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
which would have been which was

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,519
integrated with django so i thought

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
let's take a look at this inspect db

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,800
looks into a database

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:12,399
and creates all the django

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,920
models.pi files uh

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,240
which uh for those that don't know

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,440
django the models files

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,560
are the the exact uh

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,480
field descriptions of every field and

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,480
every table in an existing database

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:33,199
so we that that gave us the picture

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:35,440
or that we could work from as to what we

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:38,639
needed to do to recreate what we needed

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,240
what we needed to recreate for the

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,120
uh to to modernize the the system

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,079
um but the best thing was we didn't need

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,079
to

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,839
migrate data into a new database we

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,279
could just leave as is

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,199
and upgrade it and it's still running

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,320
it's running a version three uh

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,680
firebird at the moment um we can just

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:02,160
migrate

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,839
the client side um or the website

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
and keep the windows accounting

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,440
application untouched

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,399
so that's still there has been seen an

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:13,759
update for a very very long time

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,759
like i'm talking a decade

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,680
and yeah there's no migration

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,680
no new database infrastructure to build

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,320
nothing um and the result was something

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,320
we called wave suite

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,360
which is this is about 10 years old and

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,240
this ui i think

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
but you know it's still functional still

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,240
works it's still

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,680
uh billing customers um

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,880
and it's all it works a treat and

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,000
it's easily accessible and all the work

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,480
you need to do

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,759
is now in a python framework that is

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,759
modernized

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,600
um so

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,880
i'm coming to the close close to the end

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
of my

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,320
time slot in fact i've just gone past it

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,439
um so

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
that's my experience with it um i think

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,360
fiverr

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,439
integration with liberal offices is a

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,480
good thing i if anyone has

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,600
out there has got uh the

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,240
the uh you know

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,319
the knowledge behind how it came to be

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,120
in libreoffice i don't know that i

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,839
haven't really

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,199
looked into it but it's a good thing and

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,600
it's already if you're running

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,640
libreoffice it's already on your machine

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,720
so you've already got

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,679
a high performance database server

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,720
sitting on your

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,760
on your machine um so if you're

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,720
a developer if you're a project

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,039
uh project manager or you know anyone

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:45,679
that's

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:48,559
uh that's uh used to

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,440
dealing with the client problems you

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,039
know you've already got a high

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,160
performance database

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,600
server on your machine and it's actively

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,000
being developed

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,200
and it's um it's good for all the

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,960
reasons i've i've

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,880
outlined patrick you actually have 30

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,360
minutes so you don't need to rush

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,320
oh okay well i thought i was 15. no

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,000
you're good

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,000
well i've got 15 minutes for questions

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,440
or i could do it all again a lot more

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,440
slowly

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:29,840
there's any questions feel free to ask

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:41,360
so so that you had mentioned that

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:45,120
the m1 tank yeah tank

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,320
um and so so basically that that

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
it's to reset or well each one that goes

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,320
out

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,640
yeah well no well yeah exactly well now

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,440
i don't know the the i don't think

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,120
anyone really

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,600
knows the history um uh

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,760
their their room there was they were

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,720
awarded a three and a half million

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,799
dollar

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,960
department of defense contract um

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,919
there were rumors that is it was not

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
designed

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,360
to monitoring cleaning systems or

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:19,280
something like that

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,799
um it was there are rumors that it was

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,520
actually to do with

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,679
a development of a targeting computer

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,280
for the m1 tank

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,120
um whether or not that's true i don't

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,559
think

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,480
you know anyone's going to be able to

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,440
disclose that with any

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:42,960
level of truth because of all the

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,360
yeah sure yeah yeah but um

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,160
so apparently now i don't know this is

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,960
one you know

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,440
any physicists can let me know that uh

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,320
any

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,679
an emp pulse says something's hugely

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,360
usually

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,360
associated with nuclear weapons

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,520
now i know that they were i know the u.s

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,840
military had

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,440
things such as nuclear-tipped

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,039
rounds that you know in a in a

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,799
battlefield situation

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,120
like you know a nuclear war then they

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,080
could they could use them

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,520
with low yield and maybe it was that

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,400
maybe it was for that

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,960
i don't know but what i heard is that

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,679
every

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,320
every round would would reset the

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,880
computer

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,440
but if it's an emp pulse i don't know

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
yeah

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
for some reason it'll reset the computer

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,120
um

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,799
and that made it that meant it had to be

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,640
highly reliable and i

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,080
and a lot of the things that are already

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,919
built into

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,480
into interbase um other things that

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,280
people that other other databases

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,720
started

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,480
adding much later in their life life's

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,679
span so um you know it's not

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,600
it's not it's definitely not the

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:55,919
solution for everything but you know as

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,760
an

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,200
embedded database it is fantastic

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,200
sounds interesting i wouldn't i would

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
probably rule out the emp for sure

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
because

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,760
you have different yeah and that that

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,360
that wouldn't make sense

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:16,159
i mean in my view so yeah well it could

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:16,720
be that there's some sort of um there's

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,720
some

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,280
i don't know and there might be some

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,720
sort of uh

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,039
electronic electromagnetic uh wave that

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,559
happens from firing a a large caliber

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,039
gun that only

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,679
with the advent of computers inside

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,559
tanks

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,559
was ever noticed

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,080
and of course computers inside tanks

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,080
would have been a fairly recent uh

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,120
use case i'd say have you seen russia's

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,240
new tank

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,440
uh no it's interesting

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,159
yeah okay well but i mean that's it's

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,799
way more advanced than the abrams is now

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,600
so right well that i think the opus was

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,640
was designed in the late 70s wasn't it

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,679
so yeah it's pretty old

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,159
yeah um

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:15,440
so yeah um

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,520
i i think the history of of how we got

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
to the point where it was

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,640
you know the the multiple different

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,320
ownerships of the company and

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,880
the fact that yeah a bunch of the

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,840
developers left just kind of like uh

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,840
what happened with

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:36,400
them my sequel guys left um

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,760
and the community followed them

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,000
so firebird has got a large community of

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,280
very

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
dedicated people um they just don't get

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,880
that much love and it's quite

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,520
interesting that

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,720
that it's now included in libreoffice

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,799
but it's definitely

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:58,240
a lot more complica competent and

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:01,039
and complete in features than what you'd

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,520
expect from an open source

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,520
desktop productivity package

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,679
i wonder if i probably should have asked

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,280
florin if he knows any details as how as

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,840
to how and why it was

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,039
included we asked is anyone in the

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:21,440
audience know

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:36,720
how interbase came to be included into

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:40,240
into interlibrary office

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,279
i guess that's enough could be on the

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:51,360
uh chat uh where's the chat

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:54,720
here we go

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,039
so what do you mean by included i mean

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,240
it's

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:02,880
it's embedded into the document

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,400
uh no it's included in when you install

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,679
libreoffice

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:12,080
um the first the first thing is

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:15,200
um the original

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,559
inclusion was started one or two years

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,960
ago or something like that and

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,400
we had many problems and bug reports

00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,799
about stuff not working

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,520
so currently it's back into experimental

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,960
modes

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,840
so you have to explicitly

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,799
enable experimental features to use it

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,080
because

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,799
we thought that the migration from real

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,919
database

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,400
what is it at hsqldb

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,320
some java database i'm not expert in

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,200
that

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,799
we had problems with the migration stuff

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,279
from people

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,960
who wanted to migrate to firebird from

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,159
the old database and

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,640
stuff was simply not working so yeah i

00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,840
mean

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,240
i tried i ported

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,840
last month i bought the libreoffice to

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,600
windows

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,799
arm 64 and i tried to build firebird

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,559
with it and

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,279
well it's a cross compilation and

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,240
at least for me after the second or

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,080
third

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,480
buck i encountered which there was

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,840
something with a cross compilation

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,640
i simply dropped it currently so

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,520
i'm not sure if somebody else already

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,480
has tried

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,880
to build uh firebird with uh windows

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,880
arms

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:41,279
64. i mean it's relatively new so

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,760
yeah it's i mean if there's a way

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,720
to get out reach out to the firebird sql

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
community

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,960
um that i've never actually seen in any

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,200
references to

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,000
them at any of the big events um

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,000
so it could be

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,320
they might have already done it and

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,400
maybe it's not shared or not shared in

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,000
the right place or

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,960
um i i just

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,640
tried it for a few minutes and then i

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,440
said okay after the second

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,520
complaint from configure i said okay

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,480
there's so many other stuff i have to

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,240
port to get it

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,000
libroff is running on this platform i

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,159
will just skip it because currently it's

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,840
experimental anyway and

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,400
the whole uh arm 64 is

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,880
an experimental build at this moment i

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,919
just

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:35,039
was wondering what's the best way to uh

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,720
to build it because libreoffice has

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:42,799
like 10 or 15 patches to it

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:46,480
and right kind of large windows patch so

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,799
and i said okay too much stuff to

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,000
try to figure out what's going on there

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,840
and

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,960
i was just wondering what's going on and

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:58,720
i looked at the home page and couldn't

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,760
find exactly built instructions

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,320
maybe i was i was at least when i had a

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:06,880
look in there i didn't see anything

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,799
just about yeah foundation stuff and all

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,080
the other stuff but

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:16,480
software about her and so

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,480
so currently it's back to experimental

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,320
yeah i don't know if somebody uh from

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,760
the firebird community would be

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:24,559
interested in

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,760
looking into stuff and and help

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:30,960
developing there but yeah it's

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:34,799
libreoffice and basis

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:38,799
yeah it's not well

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:42,080
in high highly development mode

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:45,600
in libreoffice yeah main target is

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,679
uh definitely writer and and calc

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,679
so there are not many people interested

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,919
in base

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:55,440
yeah it it it's

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,360
it's one of those things that you try

00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,320
and talk to where you try and get

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,200
uh to talk to different databases and

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,399
i've

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,600
a lot of times i've given up um it's

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
probably because i haven't tried hard

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,360
enough

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,760
um but to see in included i think is a

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,440
good

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:17,279
is a good thing i've never got into hq

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,960
h sql db at all um because i was already

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,000
using firebird

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,399
so um i'm not i haven't done much with

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,399
it

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,080
i haven't done much with firebird for a

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,840
long time but i just yeah i think it's a

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,360
positive thing because it's a very

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,919
mature code base it's it's been around

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,039
it's

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:38,159
it's very very um compact and very

00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,799
and it should be a lot faster than

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,520
than access um yes uh peter's just

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,200
mentioned in the

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:48,399
in the chat um yeah

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,120
so um especially if you wanted to run it

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,000
you could of course because it's a if

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,960
you

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,279
you can build it uh or you can you can

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,279
run

00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:01,679
the sql the the firebird sql engine on a

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,720
different server if you wanted to

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,919
and have uh so you can build your

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,039
database locally take the file and drop

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,799
it into your

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:16,399
firebird server and have your have your

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,399
your users access it that way

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,960
because that's the other thing is the

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,720
access access to

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,720
the database is a connection string

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,399
username password connection string the

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
connection string just specifies the

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,880
database file

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,960
so there are two can we wrap it up so

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,000
that we can go to the next uh talk

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,279
sure okay um so yeah

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,279
anyone wants to contact me about it um

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,640
i'm not necessarily an expert in it but

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,120
i've had experience in it

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,880
uh so yeah thank you very much

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:55,600
