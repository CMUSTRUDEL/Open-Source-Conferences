Title: Building an openSUSE-based home-studio with GeekosDAW
Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: openSUSE + LibreOffice Conference 2020
Description: 
	GeekosDAW is a community project focusing on promoting and distributing FLOSS music-making software on openSUSE.

GeekosDAW starts as an offshot of the Geekos Italia openSUSE community with a clear vision: to bring a user-friendly, professional-level home studio experience to all GNU/Linux users. It does so via "patterns", a way to easily find and install packages suited for different musical needs.

After a brief overview of audio technologies (such as LV2), some music-making software will be shown: Ardour, Qtractor, Zyn-Fusion, tubeAmp and AVL Drumkits.

In the final remarks, users will be invited to join our community in a number of ways: by joining our Telegram channels, by contributing to our wiki or issue tracker or by submitting packages to OBS.

then we will go ahead and we'll speak

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,200
about

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,640
our leader repository for opensuse

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,680
which is the geekostore and it is

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,600
a repository which uh contains

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,879
a whole lot of programs to make music so

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,160
i hope someone was listening to this

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,840
will enjoy okay okay

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,840
evil you can go to the next slide

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
okay so this is our agenda for today uh

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,799
we will touch

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,400
a bit of everything i hope so

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:15,759
um you can go a divo

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,240
thanks okay so this is us

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
i don't want to bore you with details

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,159
about

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
our lives but i suppose it's important

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
to say

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,079
that ours is a pure community project

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,799
so we actually met on the web

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,680
and we we've been working for over a

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,360
year

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,880
uh on obs

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,920
together so uh our founder is joe biscay

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,799
he's a really good guitarist much better

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,960
than i am

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,399
and uh he also has some good skills

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,960
with mixing and mastering then there is

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,000
evo

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,640
who's here and he will be showing us

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,680
a demo at the end of this talk then

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,600
there is myself

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,040
i'm more of a libra software advocate or

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,759
developer i like ruby a lot and

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
then there is constantine i don't know

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,959
if

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,760
he's hearing this because he is from

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,840
russia

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,959
and it's pretty late around there so

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,319
i hope that he'll be listening

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,800
and he's done a lot of stuff for us

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,760
especially in regard to juice i think

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,959
some of you

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,959
might have heard of juice uh but

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,440
you know it's not the the thing that you

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,480
drink when you're thirsty but

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,599
it's a framework which is used by a lot

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,800
of plugins

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,480
for making music so uh no

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,160
it's j u c e okay

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,040
but okay you can go ahead diva

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,599
okay so let's take a step back okay why

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
use

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,959
linux for music making well i think

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,319
there are

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:03,280
three big advantages uh

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,760
and the for freedoms is certainly one of

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
them

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,560
i mean who doesn't like freedom i think

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,040
it's not something that all the people

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
from the us like everyone likes freedom

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,280
here uh

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,360
i guess so yes well and

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,720
in the context of software it's clear

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
that uh

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,920
free software is becoming more and more

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,319
important

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,720
uh and the audio is a field in which

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,360
it is starting to shine in the last few

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
years there

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,480
there have been interesting uh changes

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,680
in

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,400
this field so aside from this there's

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
also the

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
budget thing you know um i don't like

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,000
the

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,400
freezing beer kind of stuff because uh

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,120
free software developers need to it too

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
and

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
they need to be funded in some way so if

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,680
you can donate

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,400
but if you can't uh this is there are a

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
lot of

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,879
great software uh released under free

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,640
licenses

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,840
so you can use them

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,720
at zero cost however if you feel

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
feel free to donate and what about the

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,400
latencies

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
well i think this is a huge problem when

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,359
it comes

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,759
to audio and uh with the gnu linux

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,639
it's really simple to get low light

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,840
fancy stuff

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,160
going because of jack i think many of

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,440
you

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,720
ever already used it and in the future

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,520
also pipe wire is going to be a game

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,800
changer

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,120
now uh i'm going to be honest and there

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,400
are some disadvantages

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,759
but they can be attributed to tiered

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,880
parties and they are

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,280
well the user problems many vendors

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,720
don't really care about new linux and

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,080
this is true mostly about when

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,840
speaking about uh things which are

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,160
fdrm or hardware which can be pretty

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,560
costly but

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
doesn't have the right drivers so i

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
guess you have to be

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,240
really careful about the stuff you buy

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,240
nestivo

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
okay so why used to open souza for music

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,680
making well

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,479
it's pretty stable for starters we use

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,039
leap as a main as our main

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,520
distro but tumbleweed is also pretty

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
good

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:34,320
and it's user friendly it works out

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,960
of the box and uh but with plasma and

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,600
gnome

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
it's really easy to use even for people

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,479
who

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:45,039
aren't used to linux and also just makes

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,600
it's really simple to configure

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,560
everything

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,000
you if you're not a lead taxer then

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,800
there is the obs

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,120
which is the open source build service

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
uh this i think is my favorite thing

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,479
because

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,039
you know if you have not heard of it by

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,960
now

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,160
i think you're in the wrong conference

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,000
but uh

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,880
it's like uh github for packages so

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,160
basically there are a bunch of

00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,680
repositories in which you can

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:17,520
upload the source codes and

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,919
the directives needed to build them and

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,520
after you do that people can easily add

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,880
those repositories

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,919
such as ours and just install

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,479
packages easily from yes or deeper go

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,479
ahead devo

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:38,000
now why use geckos though

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,520
well for starters gigosto is certainly

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,160
inspired by

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:47,440
previous projects and like heavy linux

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,400
and we try what we do

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,120
differently from others is certainly our

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,160
uh

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,759
attention to the open sousa

00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,280
ecosystem and also patterns

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,000
uh is something which i we hope

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
will make the experience much more user

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,360
friendly because

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,720
you know for example if you make

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,000
chiptune music

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
uh chiptune is the video game kind of

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,800
music stuff

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,120
you can just install the pattern for

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
chiptune software and everything you

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,400
need will be delivered

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,280
by to your system automatically so

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,319
i guess that's a pretty nice user

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
experience and

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,560
we focus on the musician rather than the

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,800
coder so

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,120
okay uh everyone can contribute

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,720
and this is a very important thing

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,960
actually we don't do our

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,000
all of the work ourselves we have to

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,199
thank a lot

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,759
the existing of obs community

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
and also all the developers who make the

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,520
stuff for

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,520
us okay

00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:02,319
okay this is a selection of software

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:05,759
and we hope certainly we couldn't list

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,199
all packages we have we have a pretty

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,560
big amount of packages but we want to

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,599
single out a couple of them which you

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,160
will be using in this demo one is our

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,240
door

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:23,599
our door is or our door i think i guess

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,800
is a door or digital audio workstation

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,360
uh which i recommend to everyone who

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,319
makes

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
wants to mix music seriously it's

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,640
absolutely ready for

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,560
professional mix music making then there

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,599
is the infusion which is

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:43,120
a a new interface for xenon sub

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,519
effects scenes which does a lot of stuff

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,160
and

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,720
everyone knows really then there is a

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
lot of

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,279
software you can see here how just

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,600
you know try some of it because

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,360
i think you will be surprised by the

evo

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,959
i'm going to answer a question by

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,480
uncorks how does

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:21,760
gigosto compare to k cake studio

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,440
well uh yes apart from being debian

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,079
versus open source essentially

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,560
of course we try to have a lot of new

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,120
stuff

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,399
you know software which maybe you've

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,320
never heard of

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:38,880
v2 plugins which are really cool

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:42,160
and maybe deserve more popularity but

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,959
maybe i've been ignored by some distress

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
and not just

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,279
disrespect meant for obviously cake

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,680
studio i don't know

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,200
they're all repository but what i want

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,360
to say is that

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
we aren't afraid to try out new stuff

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,279
and put

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,839
new plugins into our repos and

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,279
we hope you know you you can come visit

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,639
us at the addresses

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,880
which you can read and we hope you will

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,560
enjoy our selection of software

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,519
and maybe if you want you can i mean

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,120
we we really are friendly we are not all

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,160
italians

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,440
as you might imagine we one of

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:24,160
our core members is russian and

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,720
we accept contributions from everyone i

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,360
think

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,720
uh okay i i think i have the time for

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
the last question how does

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,760
others incorporate to fedora gem or

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,240
ubuntu studio

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,680
well i don't have experience with fedora

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,800
gem i know about

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,720
the linux mao repos for fedora

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:45,920
um i do know ubuntu studio

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,839
i'm not a big fan of ubuntu so

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,519
i think i'm not the right person to

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,040
answer that but i think

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,800
you uh will be surprised by using uh

00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:00,399
gigo's thought that we offer some

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:04,320
pretty interesting uh patterns

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,920
which maybe is the biggest difference

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,440
okay um for me a lot of

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,959
years ago i used okay

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,079
studio and i try

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:22,240
i tried um ubuntu studio

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:26,000
and i'm see a lot of

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,360
duplicate programs uh and

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,399
a lot of instable programs

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,519
and we want to

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:39,440
have only

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:42,560
programs not unstable and

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,240
we want to search the

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:51,360
programs one programs for record

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,360
music okay we use um

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,160
we use audacity yes only of the article

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,160
not a lot of other programs that makes

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,680
something similar audacity

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,440
because we want to mix

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,480
makes all easy um users have to use

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,519
audacity and whenever a problem

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,560
is audacity for recording music

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:20,000
live music for example and for

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,959
us is much simpler to

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,519
explain what is the program for do

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,519
something

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,760
okay time is up thank you everybody

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,720
i hope you enjoyed despite

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,480
the fact that we aren't exactly public

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:45,839
speakers

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:45,839
see you

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:52,560
actually there is a break now so i guess

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,120
we are not that much in a hurry if

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,839
there's

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,839
people interested in yeah discussing

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,839
alternatives or whatever

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,800
if it's not against the rules i guess

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,920
you can ask some questions but i don't

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,480
want to take anybody's times right now

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:20,079
so i 30 times to

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,079
break we have a time to break

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,399
so if something some

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,399
users have a question we can

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,120
speak

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:41,839
question answer is not a problem

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,920
if you want to have a little little

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
demo demo live demo i can try to use

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,560
software

00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:02,399
um in our mind we want to

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,519
say and you have to see

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:08,800
is not fake

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:12,800
we are what we do is real

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:16,800
you can see what i

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:20,839
open what i configure what i um

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:23,839
play with a little keyboard if you

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
wanted

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,399
well i actually just wanted to point

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,360
something because yeah

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,920
in for me that's the first time i heard

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
about

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,880
gekko dao but it's a

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:41,600
um i i i know that some people has

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,000
well i i myself mentioned ex studio and

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,360
then this fedora young unto studio

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,920
and there is also av linux which is also

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,199
um

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,959
yes i know av linux is for

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,079
video and audio yes yes it is great

00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,920
documentation

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,079
is actually a big inspiration to me

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,240
personally

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,720
but something i like especially about

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,000
gecko now and also i believe that

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:10,319
kx studio does very well is that

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,839
you are basically providing a repository

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,120
on top of a distro

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,079
why av linux is basically an iso that

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,880
you get

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,600
as it is so it's it's it's uh like

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,120
installing

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,919
any the the operating system of that

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,720
other guy

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,799
in your computer and that's it while the

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,360
way you are following which is the same

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,760
way that

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,160
kx studio is following which is

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,840
providing a repository on top of

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,559
i believe it is much better approach so

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,919
i'm happy that i found nico though i

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,640
will

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,200
likely try it yeah okay thank you for

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,559
smart observation yes

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,400
that is actually the way that we began

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,559
working from the okay okay he was

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,840
playing some stuff so

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,360
it's only uh no it's only attached

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,840
go go what was i just wanted to add

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,200
that yes i took believe and i think it's

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,080
the philosophy of

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,960
everyone who works on the project that

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,360
desktop

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,280
and everything else the music stuff must

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,480
be separated you know you know you can't

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,600
have

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,080
things messing up other programs maybe

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,400
unrelated to one to another just because

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,960
you you're using some software to make

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,840
music so we try to avoid overlapping

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:34,000
libraries and all this kind of stuff

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,039
and for us is important for example

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:41,360
i'm a multimedia and i try new

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:44,400
programs or i try new package packaging

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,720
and sometimes i have a problem

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:53,120
i talk about other users and

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:56,160
no oh it's a bug or is a way to

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,520
use wrong wrong use

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:03,840
this program for us is important because

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:07,280
we want to have a friendly um

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:10,799
way to make music and we

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,000
testing our programs are our

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:17,840
way to use

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,559
programs to mix music because

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,919
we would like to have a lot of users

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,400
that use

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:30,880
our distro and our

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
repository and we'll be happy to

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,000
suggest a way to make music

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,679
wait a second we i have tested

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,120
this way to make correctly music

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:48,960
because it's not important only

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,240
put a lot of programs and

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,760
not have a way to use

00:19:52,240 --> 00:20:07,840
or suggest some things because um

00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:07,840
we believe in what we do

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,459

[Music]

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,080
but for example if i open audacity

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,679
velocity you can see audacity

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,679
i can

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:47,360
write recording my live session

00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:50,240
[Music]

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,240
and i can

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,859
listen my

00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,859
[Music]

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:02,960
okay again

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:07,200
first part of music

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,200
is attached for

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:15,360
c if i real recording

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:19,600
effects normalize normalizer will be

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:23,280
a function that increases

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,679
volume but not

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,679
a lot

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:45,919
0 db

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:49,039
okay and i can export

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,799
audio in

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:55,840
fl ac format

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,960
if for me is the best format because it

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,760
is a similar

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,760
wave format but

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
have a lot

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,880
he's not a compressed formatted

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:18,480
he's not a similar mp3

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,960
which is a largely

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,960
lossless format the

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,919
ears

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,080
okay and we can

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,600
listen okay

00:23:48,080 --> 00:24:05,580
this is the file

00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:08,640
the file

00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:11,919
[Music]

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,240
okay okay nice evil ah i just

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,120
wanted to see okay okay can i say thing

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,400
evo

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:21,679
um i think that what you've shown

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,960
obviously audacity which i think

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,120
many people you already know okay but

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,120
uh we have a lot of more advanced

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,919
software to make music

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,440
such as ardor then there is q-tracker

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,720
which is more suited

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,159
for midi stuff then there is a mius

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,279
which is also well suited for midi stuff

00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,320
and also it has a notation mode

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,360
and it's different from a musical

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,720
okay yes yes then there is

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,760
lms which is very good for bit making if

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,200
so if you make beats like tripop and

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,600
that kind of stuff

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,559
it's really good and then there is

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,919
obviously

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:04,720
the rhythm which is an up-and-coming new

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,120
daw

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,240
with an advanced sequencer with the

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,320
great automation

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,679
and support for guild scheme so i guess

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:19,200
that's you know one of the directions

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,840
which we are adding towards uh in the

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,960
future

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,200
and uh gigosto is fully

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:30,559
uh recognizing the potential of

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,080
the the rhythm so we hope in the future

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,080
it will become

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,080
one of our top those

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,120
okay i'm open

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:48,640
arduour and i add a

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:52,279
calf fluid synth is

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:56,400
similar to synthetic and i

00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:59,760
insert same piano sample the same

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,360
piano sample we

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:06,640
i've opened in a q synth

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:13,279
and now i

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,279
used midi i have to connect them

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,779
[Music]

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
arduour

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,279
you can hear something

00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:40,720
[Music]

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:44,320
it is similar difference

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:48,240
is midi file

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:51,600
i can arm midi

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:54,799
yes i'm ready to make a recording

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:59,919
in middle format i can

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,919
arm all arduino i can

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,840
play and recording

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,240
okay stop

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,679
this is a midi notation

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,490
and we can

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:44,159
listen

00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:49,840
[Music]

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:49,840
okay we can um

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:59,760
see a piano roll and

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,760
select single note

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:07,120
and

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:12,880
change he changes single note

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,880
it's a different is the major difference

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,320
with the recording simple audio midi

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:26,880
is a signal assigned to

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:30,399
arduino from midi keyboard

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,799
i can change the first

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,799
note

00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:43,600
[Music]

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,080
it's the difference it's not the real

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,799
note

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,799
i play no it does

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:57,200
what it was a joke

00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,720
since yes yes i can

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,559
play not very well and change my note

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:08,240
and wow you play very well

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:10,799
yes with the midi is possible

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,399
with the recording audio is not possible

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,760
because audio is difficult

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:19,279
to change a single note

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,880
in media audio is a different

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:25,200
way to play something

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,159
so if you are really bad at playing an

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,919
instrument

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:33,039
with a midi output you can sound great

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,240
now that's really good news i guess for

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:41,279
some of

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:43,360
our listeners right

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,360
um

then good music i would like to

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,000
playing something little little in

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:12,000
live i prefer prefer

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:16,080
live i like a lot a live session

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,520
evo can you use surge do you think

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,760
surge in live yes

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,760
um

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,200
card lay is carla is a program which

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,120
used to host

00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,880
plugins okay such as lv2 plugins but

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,840
also

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,240
vst plugins so there are some people who

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,760
use it for windows vsts i

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,559
i think it supports them via wine so

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,960
it's a program which can be used for

00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,000
live

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,159
playing for example or for

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,279
using plugins where lv2 is not supported

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:10,240
for example lms right now

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:12,640
i'll be too but in the future it will

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:19,840
and the kerala allows using

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:19,840
a vitru from within lms

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,960
i'm trying to play

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,960
but i

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,480
okay no problem no oh okay okay

00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:01,840
okay now this is fine

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,840
just press it can i surprise it

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,840

use a preset but

change one preset in

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:19,920
listen all precise when i

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:27,839
found a pres similar preset i

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:27,839
try to change

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,599
okay if i was speaking about cowbells i

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,640
think

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,640
it was in regards to cow wealth

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,680
which are you know an important

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,800
instrument

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,640
as most of you know because of

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,599
rock songs from the 70s and

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,079
i guess yes there are many cowbells you

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,400
cannot

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,720
use sound fonts for them or you can

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,800
synthesize them you can use

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,240
junkie yeah yeah i know i know about the

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,640
meme but uh

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,480
that's seriously a great instrument you

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,680
know

00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,440
okay i don't lose but um

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,880
because i'm trying to use and search

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,880
some fonts for uh

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:19,119
i love qsynthe if my

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,119
way to play um

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,000
live with the cuisine and

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,440
a lot of other programs all in one okay

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:33,280
i think we need to

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,920
close because uh it's almost

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,920
