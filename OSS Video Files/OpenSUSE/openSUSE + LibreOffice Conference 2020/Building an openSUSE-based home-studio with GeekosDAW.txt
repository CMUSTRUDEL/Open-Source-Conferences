Title: Building an openSUSE-based home-studio with GeekosDAW
Publication date: 2020-11-06
Playlist: openSUSE + LibreOffice Conference 2020
Description: 
	GeekosDAW is a community project focusing on promoting and distributing FLOSS music-making software on openSUSE.

GeekosDAW starts as an offshot of the Geekos Italia openSUSE community with a clear vision: to bring a user-friendly, professional-level home studio experience to all GNU/Linux users. It does so via "patterns", a way to easily find and install packages suited for different musical needs.

After a brief overview of audio technologies (such as LV2), some music-making software will be shown: Ardour, Qtractor, Zyn-Fusion, tubeAmp and AVL Drumkits.

In the final remarks, users will be invited to join our community in a number of ways: by joining our Telegram channels, by contributing to our wiki or issue tracker or by submitting packages to OBS.
