well in that case then thank you

00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,400
everybody for coming uh

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,640
my name is richard brown i'm going to be

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,440
here talking about mike the micro s

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,559
desktop and

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,759
everything we need to really take it to

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,559
the next level

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,839
um now you've seen my face it's going to

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,560
disappear because i'm going to replace

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,560
it with the slides

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,760
and i've had this work perfectly fine

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,760
there we go

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,640
all right so uh first a little bit about

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,640
me

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,640
um i've been in well in opensuse since

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,239
it began

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,760
and you know doing lots of other open

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,360
source stuff

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
um for the last seven years i've been

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,160
working at souza doing lots of

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
various bits and pieces with qa and and

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280
and

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,000
other stuff and for the last couple of

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,600
years i'm in

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,760
the future technology team where i'm

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,039
working on microarrest and cubic

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,239
mostly in open souza

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,960
this isn't the only talk about the

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,600
micros desktop so tomorrow uh dario has

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,600
a talk

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,360
yeah basically with practically the same

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,720
title which i swear we both did by

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,560
accident

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,240
um which is you know can microstop be

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
your daily driver

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
and like he says in the the title

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,159
spoiler alert for him at least

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
yes so what's the point of me talking

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,799
about all of this

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,759
well dario's proven in his talk that you

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,280
know

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,240
that he would give tomorrow that you

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,799
know it's a perfect daily driver for him

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,720
and you know he's a great developer he's

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
fine with tinkering you know we need to

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,720
do an awful lot of work to really make

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,920
it a daily driver for everybody else

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,560
um or more people i explain why i

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
ripped out the the everybody later on

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,399
and

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,560
we need more help to make this happen

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,840
this entire presentation is a plea for

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,880
help to try and get more people

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,720
interested

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,960
um so it isn't just like three people

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,479
moving this whole idea forward

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,040
so what is micro os um every time i kind

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,479
of dis

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,079
decide to talk about this i end up

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,920
changing my mind and i don't want to

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,880
talk about what use micros first i want

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,920
to talk about why

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,319
is micros and that is heart you know

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,119
micros is our response to the fact that

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,840
computers

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,400
aren't just the laptops and desktops and

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
servers

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
that we've had for the last 25 years

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,319
there you know there's far more

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,599
interesting devices out there everything

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,520
from raspberry pi's

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,760
to iot devices to computers embedded in

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,520
cars and airplanes and all this stuff

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,280
and even when you look at

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
laptops desktops and servers you know

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,160
people aren't necessarily using them the

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,440
same way that they

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,120
they have for the last 30 years um

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,519
sort of one of the classic examples is

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,200
like this ip webcam

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,879
you know there's thousands of them out

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,400
there has anybody ever updated the

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
firmware on them

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,519
well they probably should have because

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,400
like 78 of

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,920
malware out there is due to botnets you

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,280
know running because these devices

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
aren't being updated

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,160
and one of the reasons these devices

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,239
don't get updated is because the

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,400
manufacturers are terrified about

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
a failed update making many many unhappy

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,519
customers

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
and there's reasons to be worried about

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,599
that like i come from the uk

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,080
a couple of years ago like the uk o2

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
mobile network had an absolutely massive

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,879
network outage and it's because they

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,519
pumped out a firmware update

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,400
to all of their cell towers and then the

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,080
firmware update

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
basically bricked all of their cell

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,159
towers and unfortunately that also meant

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,680
they didn't have any way of putting a

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,720
new firmware update to fix all of their

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
cell towers so

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,720
poor and poor engineers had to go out to

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,200
every single location

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
for every single o2 cell in the uk and

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
manually

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,840
re-flash the firmware which was

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,440
incredibly expensive and incredibly

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,360
time-consuming and you know lots of

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,799
very unhappy customers lots of very

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,280
unhappy people you know

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,040
all because they didn't have some way of

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
sort of automatically rolling back the

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,480
update when it went horrifically wrong

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,319
so in this new world you know it's not

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,319
just a case of desktops and servers

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,680
anymore you know we have the cloud where

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,959
people can just you know

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
throw a credit card at their favorite

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,239
cloud provider and get more hardware for

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,920
any of their servery stuff you have iot

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,439
devices everywhere all doing this sort

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,200
of single one job

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,640
like a sensor or like a raspberry pi

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
where they can only really do like one

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
thing

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,840
easily anyway you've got virtualization

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,919
which also kind of encourages the sort

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,479
of one job mentality you know you have a

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:20,799
vm

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,519
the vm does one job if you need a

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,360
another

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
machine well if you need that to do

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,240
something else you don't

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,680
pat like we would used to you know just

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,479
add another package to an existing

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
server

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,160
you typically fire up another vm to do

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,960
that that second job

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,199
um and this sort of very modular just

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
keep on adding more services approach

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,400
you know it's also what you see in

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,280
containers where you know containers

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,160
also give you sort of added approach of

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,240
limiting

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,479
limiting incompatibilities by isolating

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,240
services

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,080
on the desktop side of things too you

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,880
also see trends like this especially in

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,840
the us

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,680
where like in in education like 60 of

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,280
students now are not learning on a

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,479
traditional desktop they're not learning

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,960
on mac they're not learning

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,759
on windows they're learning on a

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,400
chromebook

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
um and yeah that's not a trend that you

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,720
see everywhere in the world yeah but if

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,560
you do look at

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,320
you know the rest of the world you know

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,000
that chromebook market is growing very

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,600
very quickly

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,120
and the windows market is shrinking and

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,639
that windows market is not shrinking at

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
the expense of linux you know the linux

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,039
market

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,360
you know is that tiny little yellow

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,880
slivers you see on the bars there

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,720
and on the last bar it practically

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,199
disappears you know it's

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,440
it's ios it's chrome it's android that

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,000
are growing in that education market

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,919
and you know for those of us who kind of

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,520
lived through the computer revolution

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,360
you know it was schools first that

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
really drove a lot of those changes

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,560
because you know once a student has

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,680
learned something at school

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,919
that's going to be what they want to

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,919
expect to use in life

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,919
business can anybody else hear me

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,680
good fine wonderful

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,880
i just noticed a chat message so that's

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
all good so

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,080
regular linux is not good enough um

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,759
and and you know to kind of paint

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,840
everything in in broad strokes you know

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
regular linux distributions are all like

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
swiss army knives

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,919
you know and that's that's how we've

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,520
built them it's also why we built them

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,880
to be these first army knives so you've

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,479
got tons of

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,560
tons of different components which will

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,240
be swapped out interchangeably

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,160
um it's not focused to do any one

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,720
particular thing

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,479
and you know these lots of services and

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,520
features you know what they're great and

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,680
you know just like this for somebody

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,960
knife it can do everything

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
it doesn't necessarily mean you can do

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,600
one thing perfectly and

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,280
you end up with these sort of increased

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,199
chance of incompatibilities between

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,000
services which is the pain that

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,240
distributions

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,919
deal with when they're building it and

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,919
in production when you're running it you

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,120
know a problem with service a can easily

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,680
impact a service b

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,759
c d etc you know cascading failures are

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,360
never fun but they're a real risk with

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,599
traditional linux being used in

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,560
traditional ways

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,160
and so we've made micros and i'm talking

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,120
about this a little bit more in my

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
uh my later presentation today as well

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,440
but at its heart you know micro s

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
is open suits his answer to the yeah

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
targeting this

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,319
new world you know so at this at its

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
absolute heart it's a predictable and

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,400
immutable operating system you know once

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,280
you

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,840
deploy it you cannot alter it during run

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,520
time the root file system is read only

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,919
nothing's going to change while the

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,840
system is running

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,759
it's therefore well partly because of

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,199
that it's very reliable but also you

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,199
know you do have to update it at some

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,759
point so when you do update it

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,680
you know it is auto it is automated or

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,039
yeah iterated by default or automatic

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,160
automatable if you want

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,440
to not have it by default and any other

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,319
once those updates are automatically

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,400
applied

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
system automatically reboots system

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,680
automatically figures out how the update

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,280
worked the way it should have

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,280
system automatically but covers if the

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,560
update didn't work right

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,120
so you can really guarantee that you

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,759
know it's going to keep working

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,680
and part of that again keeping with that

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,360
reliability is you know the less things

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,199
on the system to go wrong

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,919
the less things can possibly break so we

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,400
keep micro s as small as possible

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,160
um for that kind of general use case of

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,240
it doing one job

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
um and therefore after that we expect

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,280
that things like well all the

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,280
applications all the services are

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,360
meant to be coming from something like

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,720
containers or sandboxed

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,800
potentially you could also just use

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,479
micros with like one job

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,840
being you know a binary that you've

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,080
added on there and done you don't have

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,680
to put things in containers or sandboxed

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,280
but that's really the the mindset and

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,360
the philosophy behind what we've done

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,959
with microarrays

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,959
the architecture of open season

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,719
microsoft is a little bit different

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,320
it's a distribution without a separate

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,240
code base so

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,159
we actually build micro os as a separate

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
distribution there's a separate iso it's

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
got a different product name

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,640
there's different uh cuco images and vm

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
images and all of that stuff

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,560
but everything is actually built as part

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
of tumbleweed we build it in the factory

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,600
project with the rest of tumbleweed

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,640
we test it in open qa with the rest of

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,880
tumbleweed

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,320
the the release process is completely

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,080
indistinguishable

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,440
which is great because that means if i

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
break anything in micro s

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
i stop all of tumbleweed being released

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,800
or just as

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,399
likely you know if tumbleweed has a bad

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,680
day micros doesn't release

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,200
so we never we're always yeah keeping

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
each other in check and also making sure

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,080
that neither

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,760
sort of side of the coin breaks each

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,120
other

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,279
which also helps keep everything nice

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
and reliable

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,800
the idea of the micros desktop basically

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,920
started about this time last year when i

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
did a presentation

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
that didn't have any slides i was just

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,160
kind of on stage ranting about

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,680
wouldn't this be a cool idea um but yeah

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,959
at its heart it's taking that micros

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,399
idea

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,880
and then like why don't we just make

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,279
that one job of being a desktop

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,120
now that question leads to like a whole

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,959
bunch of stuff like you know a desktop

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,800
isn't a nice simple thing that you can

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,959
containerize

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,279
and so what it's evolved to since there

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,440
is really taking the micro s

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:59,120
basic system and then expanding it so

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,399
the micros desktop includes a minimal

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,839
base system

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
with a desktop environment of your

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,079
choice and the basic configuration tools

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,560
for that desktop environment so things

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,160
like the known control panel and the kde

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,920
sort of basic suite of tools for you

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,839
know configuring the thing

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,560
and then everything else applications

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,800
browsers believer office etc

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,240
are all expected to be coming from flat

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,560
packs from flat up

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,079
um or app images if you want or whatever

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,079
but typically speaking as a project

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,440
we're very much focused on

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,120
using flat hub by default

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
who is this for well it's not for

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
everybody like if you're perfectly happy

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,959
with

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,800
tumbleweed and your leap desktop cool

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,399
fine you know great you know

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
we're not there to kind of dislodge

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
anything that people are doing there

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
um but i i find myself as an

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,160
increasingly lazy developer

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
i don't want to have to hack around on

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,880
my tumbleweed desktop or even the leap

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,120
desktop

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,399
the way that i used to you know i i just

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
want to have a machine

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,160
that just i can rely on that's always

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,680
going to have the same packages on it

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,000
and it's going to update itself and it's

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,680
going to reboot itself

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,519
and yeah there's some applications where

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,160
i really care about having the latest

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,240
version and

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,760
getting all that right but those are in

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,760
many cases those are applications i'm

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,800
already running in flat packs

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,160
um so yeah in some respects you know the

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,560
micro desktop is

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,760
folks like me you know lazy developers

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,360
um but also

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,959
you know this concept really should

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
appeal to that same audience

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
that are really being attracted more and

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,839
more to the sort of the ios the

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
chromebook or the android

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,120
experience where you know they're not

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,560
they don't want to mess around with the

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,920
operating system

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,920
they just want to be given an operating

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,800
system that works and it's automatic and

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,640
reliable

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,079
but at the same time you know they're

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,120
end users they're going to want to make

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,640
sure they're running the

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,320
the correct latest version of

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,160
libreoffice they want to

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
make sure that they're running the

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,760
latest browser

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
um and that kind of thing works very

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,519
very nicely when

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,160
upstream projects are already packaging

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,959
that stuff

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
already in flatbacks so like why not

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,800
just

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,120
use that why do we don't need to

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,040
reinvent the wheel we don't need to

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,600
package and maintain all of that again

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,600
separately

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,880
so as a project sort of my overarching

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,800
goals that i want to see micros

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,160
sort of reach this year is you know it

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,880
should be reliable predictable and

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,399
immutable just like regular micro os

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,079
it should be less customizable than

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,760
tumbleweed and leap like that's that's a

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,200
core goal like tumbleweed and leap are

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,880
wonderfully customizable we're looking

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,040
for something that's more kind of

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,279
refined out of the box and you know less

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,160
to go wrong hopefully

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,360
um but not too much less to go wrong so

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,279
one of the biggest problems we have with

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,720
micros right now is it's small and it's

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,639
probably a little bit too small

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,240
we don't want it to be small at the

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,079
expense of functionality we want

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,160
printing to work we want gaming to work

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,360
we want media production to work

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,040
and use cases like that you know do need

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,120
to uh do need to

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,200
have drivers and stuff enabled to enable

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
that that on the base system

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,720
um and so you know some of those things

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,240
are missing right now or not quite

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,399
configured the way they should be

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,000
we want to add that we want to fix that

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,399
um someone just asked you know what

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
about

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,560
thin client kiosk type users yes perfect

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
for that as well um

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,639
you know that's definitely a perfectly

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,760
valid use case for that

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,440
um but you know you'll need to have

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,720
some the lock down wouldn't be the

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
problem that's actually really easy

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,560
because there's not really much to lock

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,560
down

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,079
the trickiest part would actually be

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,519
making the applications or services

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,959
available you want like right out of the

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
box but i'll be talking about that in a

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,639
second

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
and yes you know we want the desktop to

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,639
just work

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,480
straight out of the box no yeah no

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
tinkering just you know just like you

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,200
get when you get an android device or an

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
ios device

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,959
you turn it on the first time it boots

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,320
it works

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:46,000
um i'll answer lubosh's question later

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,279
because yeah he kind of he's

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,440
asking questions that i want to answer

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,279
about in the slide um

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,720
and yeah there's other questions running

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,160
into the chat i will i will promise to

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
answer them all later

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,160
um the desktop status at the moment you

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,639
know it is put it is

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,320
like the main micro us it is during the

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,760
whole reliable predictable mutable stuff

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,480
perfectly fine

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,959
and it is less customizable like i said

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
you know

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,240
it's small and it's maybe a little bit

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,240
too small now so i'm definitely not

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,199
happy with with reaching the goal there

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,079
you know we're not

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:18,000
able to get everything running um

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,320
printing was added like this week

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,279
so you know printing's there now um but

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,680
we don't really have

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,120
sort of any success or test or really

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,800
active active testing on things like

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,959
gaming and multimedia and media

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,079
production that kind of thing

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,440
and yes this none of this is working out

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,440
of the box right now as you'll see when

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,279
you go to dario's session

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,720
you know he has to do a whole bunch of

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,920
stuff on a fresh installation to get it

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,880
all up and running

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,000
we want everything like that to be done

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,639
dusted automated

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,360
so the whole thing just works the

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:52,880
covenant team there's only about davis

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:55,040
working on this at the moment fabian is

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,639
taking care of the kde side of things

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,160
dario is mostly taking care of the gnome

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,639
side of things and i'm the release

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,320
engineer for micros so i'm

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,760
juggling those submissions and i i also

00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,680
do a little bit of the loom stuff on the

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,240
side as well

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,600
but there's room for like way more like

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,240
you know

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,000
fabian dario i all need more help we

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,839
don't have enough time to do everything

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,920
we want to get done here

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,600
we have nobody working on open qa tests

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,120
right now that would be lovely

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,120
we don't have anybody kind of looking at

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,399
it from sort of a ui ux point of view

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,880
and like making sure that everything

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,600
makes

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
perfect sense there um you know we'd

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,880
love people to be going out there

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,639
talking about this more advocating for

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,279
it marketing what we're doing

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,959
um we've got kde and gnome right now do

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,480
we want other des that's a question i'll

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,240
come back to you later

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,680
and if anyone has other ideas like we

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,800
see in the chat asking about things like

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,880
kiosks you know

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,320
yeah why not you know if you're willing

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,959
to help and willing to help us do it

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
then

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,160
you know this is a lovely project to

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,240
kind of get your teeth into

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,880
because it is very open-ended where we

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
could take this

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,639
top issues generally this kind of

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,600
affects every variant of microarrest

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,320
desktop at the moment

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,279
is you know the out-of-the-box

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,199
experience is

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,399
you know imperfect like i said dario's

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,440
talking about that mostly in this

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,959
session

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,040
you know there's too much configuration

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,079
required you have to add the flat up

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,759
config yourself

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,279
you have there's no default flat packs

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,839
apps there

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
um you know yeah we want all of that to

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,399
be

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,079
tweaked tuned out so you know you just

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,600
get a decent system that works as soon

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,759
as you install it

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,360
there's no ui for transactional updates

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,680
in any of the desktop environments right

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
now

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,440
so you know the system automatically

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,639
updates the system automatically reboots

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,639
and it doesn't really tell the user what

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,079
it's doing

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,600
it would be very nice either to have

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,959
transactional update integrated with

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,120
package kit somehow

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,720
or to maybe have some alternative

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,240
notification which which

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
like at least just tells you you know

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
hey there's an update pending hey i'm

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,800
going to reboot this evening or you know

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,759
when you next reboot you're going to get

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,480
all these updates

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,040
something like that um the policy kid

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,600
rules

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,240
um that you know we're currently using

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,920
are

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,519
way too stringent than you really need

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,199
one for a desktop environment so you get

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,800
like a bunch of root password prompts

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,559
that you really don't want like when you

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,079
turn the machine off

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,760
and at the moment we don't have any

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,520
vmware appliance images so to kind of

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,959
ask lubosh's question about how do you

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,000
install it

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,400
um you download the micro os iso

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,160
the regular micros iso that does all the

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,480
other microarrest stuff

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,720
and there is a you know you you boot up

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,240
that it's a standard yas installation

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,240
just like tumbleweed just like

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,000
like leap and there is an option there

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,360
for the micros desktop for kde and the

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,520
micros desktop for gnome

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,360
and the installation process is it's

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,160
very much like a standard opensuse

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,919
desktop

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,240
just with last questions because we

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:43,200
don't need quite as many questions and

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,200
things to work there um yeah

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,799
top issues on kdk the east side right

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,080
now i'm not as

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,480
up to speed on this so i just kind of

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
asked fabian what he's working on and

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
this was like the one that he's most

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,600
annoyed with at the moment and that's

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,200
discoverer which you know seems to be

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
like when you remove the the package

00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,880
gets

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,559
separate back end and you just have it

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,559
set up for flatbacks it seems like way

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,080
more unstable than usual and crashing

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,760
like crazy so

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,360
he'd really like somebody to have a look

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,039
at that

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,039
on the gnome side of things which both i

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,559
and daryl are using more um i

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,320
actually did a fresh installation before

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,280
doing this presentation and that's when

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,640
i realized that

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,559
sometime between the last time i

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,919
installed it and now um

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,160
something's gone wrong with the

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,919
dependencies for the the icon theme so

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,080
you end with an installation that has no

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
icons and everything is a question mark

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,880
um i was going to fix it for this

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,559
presentation because it's like a really

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,559
simple one-liner um

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,400
there's the patterns micro s package

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,480
which i'll talk about more later

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
like anybody could just add that there

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,760
to the gnome pattern

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,280
and it'll fix it right away but i

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,000
decided to actually leave it open and

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,679
leave it broken

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,280
because you know it's a perfect like

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,919
first time contribution to anybody who

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,080
wants to

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,120
dive in with this so you know i'm going

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,120
to leave it a week or two

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,799
hopefully people see this presentation

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
hopefully it stays broken yeah hopefully

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,320
someone dives in and fixes it so i don't

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
have to fix it in a week or two

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,600
um at the moment by default when the

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,520
thing starts up

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,200
um rpms and the like are still being

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,520
shown in gnome software

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,960
um and things like flat pack aren't you

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,600
know we want that to

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,280
be removed and tidied up so you know the

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,280
rpms aren't showing them and only the

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,120
flat packs are showing there

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,440
things like system mounts all of the

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,919
btfs sub volumes are showing in nautilus

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,080
i have

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,679
absolutely no idea why that's happening

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,200
um because it doesn't happen on a

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,320
regular tumbleweed or a regular leap

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,160
machine

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,080
and things like the dock are not

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,919
populated with any key tools so

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,760
like you get nautilus on the dock and

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,600
you don't have like gnome software which

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,440
probably should be there as well as any

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,160
default installed flat packs when we

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,600
start

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,600
default installing flatbacks

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,840
there this is just yeah kind of an open

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,400
question

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,919
um you know noman kde makes perfect

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,440
sense for like the ios android

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,160
chromebook use case

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,440
but when you look at what some some

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,360
developers might want you know

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,559
incredibly geeky ones in particular you

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,160
know you might want like a really

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,520
trimmed down window manager like

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,919
experience

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,919
um and you see what the the sway team

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,320
are doing

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,240
where they've got you know opensuse sway

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,440
with weyland and a very nice window

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,200
manager all

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,840
tightly integrated and packaged really

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,440
well um i'm kind of curious at the idea

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,320
of you know maybe there should be a sway

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,720
variant of micro s which is like really

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,559
for micros desktop like really focusing

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,080
on on that kind of

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,840
developer use case and that also might

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,440
be an interesting idea for things like

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,039
kiosks because you know it's going to be

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,400
some even simpler to lock down

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,520
nothing there just you know load up the

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,600
application job done

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,200
on the flip side though you know it's an

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
open question of you know

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
do we need to have all these multiple

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,080
desktops you know for the ios android

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,000
chromebook use case

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,240
you know even just asking a user do you

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,320
want kd or gnome is a scary choice

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,679
um and if i look at where the project is

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,840
right now you know most of

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,200
the attention most of the users most of

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,919
the contributions

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,760
are all around the known variant um and

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,120
there isn't really much

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,480
but i don't know if a single user

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,159
actively using the kde one and there

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,480
isn't really that much contributions i'm

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,120
seeing on the kde side of things either

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,640
um so like it kind of is a sort of the

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,480
opposite open question you know should

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,240
we just focus on gnome and not bother

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,880
with doing multiple desktops

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,440
um it's an easy one to answer if you

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,120
feel no

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,360
then contribute because i'm not going to

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,080
like start dropping desktops if

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,679
no if people are working on it um but if

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,080
we don't see more contributions on that

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,679
on things like sway or kde you know i

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,440
can very much easily see

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,960
that you know as we get no more more

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,720
more polished up

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,240
anything else might drop away as it's

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,679
just not really viable because it

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,679
doesn't have the contributions behind it

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,080
if you're interested in contributing

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,039
they're really like three key places to

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,640
to to dive in and get involved there's

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,039
the patterns micros

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,640
package in which is in develop cubic

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,440
that's where these desktop patterns are

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,280
so things

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,720
like packages missing drivers missing

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,600
you know features missing that you don't

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:03,039
want it's really a simple case of like

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,039
osc branching that package

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,799
adding the correct packages that you

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,039
want to either the kde or the

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,840
known pattern or if you want to add a

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,679
different desktop

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,039
adding a different desktop pattern there

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,880
first

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,480
and then submitting that and i'll review

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,039
it and i'll send it to factory and

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,400
there we go done um that's yeah at the

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,559
moment that's where most of

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,240
the work is is going into because mostly

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,240
it's a case of adding and removing

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,320
packages that need to be there

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,440
um for something that's like a little

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,840
bit more extensive

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
like uh changing the partitioning

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,159
arrangement

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,760
which is something we're thinking of

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,360
doing because like right now it's

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,039
inheriting the sys the partitioning

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,320
arrangement from

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:44,240
uh yeah uh

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,840
website it's receiving the partitioning

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,760
arrangement from

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,880
regular micro os which is very container

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,280
orientated and you know

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,159
users don't write to var quite as much

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
when it's their

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,000
desktop they write to home far more so

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
maybe the partitioning makes more sense

00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,799
to have home is a much bigger

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,520
partition um so for things like that or

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,679
for

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,159
adding a new system roles adding like a

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,000
full-blown new variant like sway

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,760
um you also need to modify the the

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,880
control file this is the the file that

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:15,760
yast uses

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,000
to run through yast um that's in github

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,039
if you send a pull request there i'm the

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,799
reviewer for it

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,080
i can review it to help you with it so

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,320
you know nice and easy to

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,840
get involved there and also so with the

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,039
entire yas team because they're also

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,760
co-maintainers of that

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,039
so it's kind of a nice easy place to

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,640
dive in if you're doing something more

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,880
extensive

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,559
and then if you want to do something

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,240
other than the traditional iso

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:41,039
installation approach like i really

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,480
like this idea of having like a usb

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,799
stick which just boots up

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,000
and finds the hard disk on the machine

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,559
and

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
nukes it with a pre-configured image of

00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,520
open suse and micros desktop

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,400
well the the open season micro s

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,840
package in develop cubic images is where

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,600
that needs to be done

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,000
um there we already have all of the

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,520
other micro os and cubic images there so

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,520
there's plenty of examples to see

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,440
there's also actually a self-installing

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,279
one so it does everything i just said

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,440
but it does it for the regular micro os

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,640
not for the micro s desktop

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,679
so if people want to to do that then

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,120
that would be very nice to see the

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:22,960
contribution there

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,159
and yeah we everything in micros kind of

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,240
originally started

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,600
as part of cubic so we're currently

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,960
using the cubic milling list and not

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,320
anything separate so

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,400
please feel free to join us on that

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,440
mailing list um

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,960
or in the cubic irc channel um or just

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,960
you know send the submissions straight

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,400
in so default cubic is is where most of

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
this microwave stuff is but

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,919
for the other stuff like gnome kde et

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,760
cetera you know factory is

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:47,440
you know also where all that stuff's

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,440
moving around

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,559
and the like now i have five minutes

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,120
left and there's a whole bunch of

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,360
questions

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,960
so forgive me but i'm going to scroll up

00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:01,279
and see what hasn't been answered by

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:03,279
other people in the chat

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,960
cool and people keep on sending new

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,000
messages so it scrolls down again gifs

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,000
please give me two seconds

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,600
right uh so yeah i've answered the

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,919
question about kiosks

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,200
for lubash lubosh asked you know how

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,679
does the installation look like

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,360
it installs just like yest um and then

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
he asked something about flatbacks

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,480
but somebody else messaged again so

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,799
let's scroll it down

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:31,440
um yeah uh he then also asked

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,640
um will apps be installed from flat up

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
as part of the initial installation

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
process that's something i would very

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,880
much like to see

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,480
uh sids asked you know what about snaps

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,320
um simple answer if you're asking me

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,760
i don't want anything to do with snaps

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,240
ever um

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,960
and and i really do not like the idea at

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,120
all

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,240
um if somebody else wants to maintain it

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,279
you know good luck

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,320
you know so you know i'm like if i don't

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,600
have to touch it then

00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,279
fine uh

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,640
and yeah somebody said you know it

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:03,360
should be small but all the stuff should

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,840
work

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,279
which sounds like a contradiction it's a

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,440
challenge it's a balancing act you know

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,279
we want it as small as it needs to be to

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,200
do all of the stuff

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,039
so it's not going to we don't want the

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,440
installation to be big and bulky and

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,440
like all the bells and whistles that

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,480
um the tumbleweed and leap have out of

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,240
the box and

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,520
also for going if we're going down the

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,440
road of something like

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,120
with flatub they have a lot of the

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,240
drivers in their run times already and

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,279
and that kind of thing so we don't

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,880
necessarily need

00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,799
and codex and that kind of thing so we

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,240
don't need to draw quite as much into

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,559
the base system

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,360
um so it's that balancing act we want it

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,240
to be trim

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,279
and as sleek as possible but we don't

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,880
want to like

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:47,120
 it where it just can't do stuff

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,120
and

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,840
seeing any other questions

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,520
neil said he's already going to be

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,840
looking at the

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,640
uh looking at the package kit stuff

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,320
which is nice thanks neil

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,240
and axel asked you know why should i use

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,600
flat pack if the package is available in

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,120
tumbleweed well

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,600
it's a good question um i to be honest

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,960
my answer is i want tumbleweed to have

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,720
less stuff in it that's kind of

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,880
one of my long-term goals i kind of like

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,600
the idea of opensuse caring about less

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,960
stuff

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,320
um this is something that i talk about

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,279
more in my presentation in a couple of

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,200
hours

00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,360
um but generally speaking you know i

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,600
think we need to accept the fact that

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,720
that the world is moving quicker than we

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,360
can keep up with

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,159
and so we have to pick our fights and if

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
we have this

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,440
library of stuff which upstream is

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,360
already packaging and upstream is

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,880
already taken care of then why the heck

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,880
should we do it all again the second

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,760
time like what extra value do we

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,120
really bring to packaging our own

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,320
desktop stuff

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,000
um that's a whole other debate i know

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,600
um but you can come to my presentation

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,080
later shameless plug

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
and i'll argue with me with that there

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,559
um but really

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,440
for me this is kind of the the balancing

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,520
act

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,200
that i think we can strike with the

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,480
migrants desktop you know we can figure

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,240
out which bits we want to take care of

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,640
which we bits we do right

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,840
and we can then work better with

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,600
everybody else where

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,720
they're already packaging that stuff in

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,039
a way that makes sense for them

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,880
and does anybody have any last questions

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,840
before i

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
tidy this up

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,279
just just for the sake of the recording

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,279
i repeat the question it's like has

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,960
has uh yeah has anybody reached out to

00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,880
like katie or gnome about like

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,799
using this concept as like an official

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,600
partnership distribution with with

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,960
either kd either project um and the

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,279
simple answer is

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,480
no um but it's something that i would

00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,960
like to do

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,760
once we get those like checkpoints

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
marked off when

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,960
i did on the slides like once kate the

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,320
micros desktop is kind of ready for

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,520
prime time usage

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,679
i think we're in a much better place to

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,120
kind of reach out to others with that

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,039
right now with the amount of stuff you

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,600
have to do like just go to dario's talk

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,360
tomorrow

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,960
like i don't think it's really ready to

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,880
show that to them

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,880
but that's it okay then thank you very

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,600
much everybody and uh yeah hopefully to

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,880
see

00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:46,880
