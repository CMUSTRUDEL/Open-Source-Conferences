excellent so uh

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,800
i guess we are right on time

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:21,920
and we should start thank you

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,960
very much for attending and thank you

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,080
opensuse and libreoffice for having me

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,560
um i'm going to be talking about new

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,800
health

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,399
and more specifically later on

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,079
the talk on the mobile application and

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,480
desktop application

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:46,800
for the personal health record

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:52,000
that will work on libre phones

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,000
and kde desktops so

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,039
going through the agenda we'll talk a

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,160
bit about

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,080
the new health history

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,560
then we'll get into the ecosystem

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,159
components

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
we'll dive into uh specific on my new

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,560
health and why this

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,560
was created

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,560
a bit of the technical infrastructure

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,159
and finally if we have time we'll go for

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,159
some questions and answers

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,360
just a bit about me um i'm a computer

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,479
scientist

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,119
and a physician by training and

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,520
my speciality is into uh genomics and

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,560
medical genetics

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,840
and into the activism i i love social

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,280
media

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,040
uh animal rights and of course leave the

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,520
software you'll see that i don't really

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,439
talk much about open source but

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,880
at the end we all know what we're

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,920
talking about

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,119
and it's fine with me people like to say

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,280
open source free software i like to call

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,960
it leave the software so

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,759
um it's it's what it probably

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,640
gets more into uh freedom and in the

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,840
philosophy

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:17,680
of of our project

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:21,040
you can reach me there falcon

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,879
health.org anytime

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,879
you want just drop me an email

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,400
well a new health project

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,400
starts

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,040
oh louvos is saying

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,280
maybe it's issue on my side but i still

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,959
see slides from richard

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:49,519
no no i i can i can see louise

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:52,720
slice okay try to try to click

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,120
click directly on lewis icon

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,000
you are still locking the focus on

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
richard

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,360
good thank you okay cool

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,760
so it's a very brief

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
history of new health in the community

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,800
the picture

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,519
that you're seeing there was the very

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,120
first project in

00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:16,480
2006 that's

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,599
santiago el estero in argentina and we

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
were actually

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:25,519
going through rural schools and putting

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:27,360
new linux desktops on their classrooms

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
and then i noticed that these kits

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,959
needed a bit more than just technology

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,680
and that's where all these uh you know

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:39,360
rural medicine and social medicine

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,599
uh concepts uh came to my mind

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,640
and that's where actually we started

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,000
developing

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:51,519
canoe health uh and um

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,360
doing so we created

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:59,040
the guinea solidario ngo that's the ngo

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
behind new health it's a non-for-profit

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,840
organization that works

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,080
globally and we are focused on

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,840
social media and social media is a very

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,280
vast

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,560
topic okay

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,680
from primary care to epigenetics so it's

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,720
it's it's very quite complex

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,840
stuff um

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,960
in 2011 richard stallman declared new

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,240
health an official

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,960
new project and since then

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,440
it has been hosted in kenya savannah by

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
the

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,400
free software foundation and it has many

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,880
mirrors around the world

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,520
we are actually thinking on creating

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,639
other uh

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,720
mercurial repositories to uh host

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,919
the different ecosystem components that

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,840
we will see

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,960
on the presentation not just having it

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,000
on one

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,880
and um yeah we we

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,360
are we pride ourselves to have a very

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,680
nice

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,639
friendly international community people

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,680
from

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,720
uh germany austria scotland

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,479
spain argentina

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:16,960
united states i mean you name it we

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,960
we have a pretty nice large community

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,680
these are just some examples of

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,919
people using new health around the world

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,759
from the red cross

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,680
to hospitals in argentina or in cameroon

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,880
or in india

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:42,960
from small primary care clinics

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,280
to very large hospitals like in the case

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,560
of

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,840
aims in in india or nationwide

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:54,479
implementation like in laos or

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,120
jamaica so depending on what you do you

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,240
will

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,400
choose the packages that are needed uh

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,479
for your institution where you are the

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,840
research institutions where you are

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,880
a laboratory where you are a primary

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,720
care

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,680
center um guinea health usually has the

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,560
uh

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,560
the solution for to feed your needs

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:25,199
now um again you know i try to

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,800
kind of fill the gap

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:31,759
between health informatics

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,520
and social medicine because usually what

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,840
you see around is a

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,160
an over sophisticated system of health

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,520
that doesn't really actually

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,800
meet the needs of the population so

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,680
uh i think that by bringing social

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,160
medicine

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,039
that gap is filled that me that gap is

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,639
met

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,479
and it's actually taking care of over 80

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,599
percent of the

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,639
issues that create

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,479
diseases come from social

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,199
determinants of health so we needed

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,560
programs and we needed computing power

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,880
to actually

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,880
take care of those of those issues

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,720
as i said before is an official new

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,680
project everything and every single

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:26,240
component it's a libra software

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,280
um we have the package for opensuse

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,120
and we of course have the

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,840
uh the um code are pi pi it's uh

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,520
most of the code is python so you will

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:44,639
see the different packages on on pi by

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:48,400
but um yeah we have some vogs uh

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,479
code for for portals we use flask

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,759
and the documentation is currently on

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,199
wikibooks

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,479
and and we will keep wikibooks

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,319
but we will also have

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:04,720
our own documentation portal um

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
that will keep track of every single

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,120
version that

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,319
that we have so so these are some of the

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,360
the operating system databases

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:20,240
and the development environments that

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,800
that we use on the new health ecosystem

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,680
so these are the main components okay so

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
so

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,160
so you have a hospital management

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,680
information system

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,959
you have a way of running

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,479
embedded for for domiciliary units

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,519
and in small centers and

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,839
also for laboratories and so on many

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:47,200
people use the new health embedded

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,399
solution and you have the limbs

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,240
to interact with

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,760
all the hardware in the on the labs

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,519
you have the bioinformatics package

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,880
that deals with genomics and all these

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:09,040
natural variants and mutation

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:12,959
cancer research and rare diseases and

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,959
and all these things related to genetics

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,240
and um one very interesting

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,480
component it's what kind of

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,760
put all of these together that that is

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,440
the new health

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,680
federation specially fitted for

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,680
for large nationwide

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,680
implementations

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
this is just one of the components here

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,519
you'll see some screenshots

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,440
from the new health hospital management

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,120
information system

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:50,800
from here you can do from

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,480
diagnostic imaging to pediatrics to

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,040
gynecology

00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,080
to histopathology you have cameras

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:04,720
you have agendas

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:08,320
and you pretty much can't run

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,160
a a a hospital okay you have stock

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,839
management you have

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,160
bed management you have operating rooms

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:21,519
uh you have pharmacies labs and so on

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,040
so it's it's a pretty large uh

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,959
program um but it's it's it's

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,720
quite stable now it's been running for

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:36,079
over 10 years now 11 years now so

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,680
this is what institutions use the most

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,760
hospitals use the most

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,160
is the hospital management information

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
system

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,920
but what takes us today is the uh what

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,800
the the the upcoming um

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,240
personal health record so up until now

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,079
we have had

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,680
a new health focused on

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,800
the system of health that means you deal

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,360
with you know

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:10,160
health professionals health institutions

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,320
governments public health and so on

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,240
which has been very valuable for them to

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
take care of their patients and their

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,360
people but

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,000
we needed or i felt the need to

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,519
give or to empower the person the

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,560
citizen itself

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,279
and and and to make the citizen part

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,120
of the system of health and to do that

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,480
you need an application you need a

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,959
desktop application

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
and you need a mobile application right

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,120
um

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,800
but i was kind of stuck

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:50,000
because i didn't find any

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,000
device that was delivered meaning

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,320
i didn't feel comfortable comfortable

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,240
with either

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,519
android or ios

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,160
in terms of privacy um

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,160
so i kind of waited to see

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,839
the upcoming off

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,200
a phone that actually ran keno linux on

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,240
it but but the code itself was open

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,279
right and that's where

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,040
pine phone showed up and

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,000
at the same time i met alex poyle from

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,240
kde and he told me hey why don't we you

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,200
know

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,959
do something on on this platform and and

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,120
kirigami and so on and

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,880
and i think yeah well it sounds

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,560
wonderful and

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,279
i started learning um kirigami and cute

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,399
and

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,800
qml and all this really neat stuff

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,760
and that's what we're doing today okay

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,120
so

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,399
the idea is you need or we need an

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,040
application that has to be easy for the

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,120
end user right everybody should be able

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,639
to install it

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,440
and and to run it and

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,839
but at the same time it has to be good

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,880
in

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,320
privacy right you know that that's

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,600
that's one of the key ideas of

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,360
liberty software that that that respect

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,639
your privacy right

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,639
or we at least

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,880
intend to respect your privacy in the

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,959
coding that we

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
that we put on it from the operating

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,639
system to the application level

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,399
all the way around

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,839
um this is part of the technology that

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,160
we are using at

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,959
my new health it's it's again it's a

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,839
python application we use qt for python

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,839
um it used to be called buy site2

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,480
christian is one of the leaders of the

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,800
pie psy2

00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,160
project and he's also helping us out on

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,279
the application so

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:06,480
we are very excited about it and

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,680
we use matplotlib for charting in the

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,959
same way that we use

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,800
matplotlib uh in the uh

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,480
health and hospital information

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,480
management system that's that's the good

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,800
thing about

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,680
you know the python library is that they

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,560
are reusable

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,839
so we we got used to them and it's it's

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,839
a beautiful

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:31,120
library and and and now we we got to

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:34,240
uh port it to my new health

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,519
a kirigami does a beautiful job

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,160
because i'm able to run the very same

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,279
code

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,639
on the kde desktop than

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
on my pine phone

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,199
tiny db it's

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:57,440
it's a database system

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,800
json based it's a document oriented

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
database

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,560
uh that fits quite well for for what we

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,320
want remember that this

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,800
is this is a one user db right that this

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,839
is a

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,959
it says db that belongs to you

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,480
to your laptop to your desktop and to

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,959
your phone

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,639
it's not a multi-user db for those we

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,600
have another ones that we'll see later

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,600
and genupg basically for

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,440
um

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,680
for encrypting and signing documents

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,680
right

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,880
so this is what it looks like these are

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,120
current screenshots

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:45,040
screenshots from the kde desktops

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,040
basically now we are we are

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,800
using the bio okay and then you have the

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,880
cycle the social

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
you can upload documents and and of

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,160
course if you are in

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
in a in a dive straight if you have an

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,720
issue

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,199
you can call emergency remember that we

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,000
are working on social media right so

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,040
there are a lot of things that are

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,800
important there

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,639
so nutrition is it's important

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,320
family affection is important you have a

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,600
lot of stuff that

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,440
goes beyond the vital signs okay vital

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,040
signs are very important and in fact we

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,000
are putting some of them here in these

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,920
charts

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,040
but they are just one part of the

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,320
picture right

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,480
and um uh i i

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,000
i just love it i mean kirigami makes it

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,360
really really nice

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
to to work with and and and the user

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,839
experience

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,959
it's it's quite quite good

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,160
um and as i said those plots that you

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:50,800
see there

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:54,880
are are coming from the matplotlib

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,600
and this is actually a a actual

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,399
picture that i took uh from the pine

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,720
phone

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,600
uh showing pretty much the same okay but

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,120
this time on

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,720
on the uh on the mobile device right

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,880
we are using a kde nail but

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,079
it should be portable to to any uh

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,839
operating system that works

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,839
on on pine 64.

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,919
and now i would say that one of the good

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,280
things about

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,760
the new health ecosystem is that

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,720
we just we use this concept of

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,240
federation

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,480
meaning any of us

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,360
whether you are a laboratory whether you

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,760
are a person

00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,720
whether you are an academic institution

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,000
or

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:53,440
or a hospital you are a node

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,520
if you want to be part of the federation

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,360
you will become a node

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,720
and my new health itself it's a node

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,640
meaning that you can say hey i want to

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:10,480
share

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,480
specific data or specific set of data

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,120
for example my vitals okay or or my

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,720
glucose

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,039
my blood glucose levels uh

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,760
and you can send that anonymize or you

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,039
can send it to your health professional

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,520
um and that what makes you

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,039
part of the system of health okay at

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,320
that moment

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:39,360
at that moment you are part

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:42,080
of the system of health okay um

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,280
which which is great i mean especially

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
now in this

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,480
context of the pandemic you don't have

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,919
to

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,160
move from your place and and send your

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,280
your information to your nurse or to

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,400
your

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,520
primary care physician and

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,559
or or if you are in trouble you can

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,559
you can you know click that emergency

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,200
button and we'll send that information

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,559
remember it's much more than just

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,039
vital on clinical data what what you are

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:18,320
supposed to put here so basically

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:21,280
that information will go

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,480
to the new health information system now

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,080
we are talking of a

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:29,039
very very large database which is also

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,320
postgres so we said on the phones and on

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,840
the desktops

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,919
if you are running your personal

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,480
uh health record you're going to have

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,320
the tiny db that's that's your

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,240
database okay that's where you're going

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,240
to be storing your data in your

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,440
documents and so on

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,760
but if you want to be part of

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,200
the new health federation that

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,600
information will go

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,720
straight it will go through the thalamus

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,320
which is

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,840
kind of the message server the

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:03,200
authentication and message server

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,200
and then from there

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:12,000
it will go to a very large postgres

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,480
documentary oriented database so we're

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,360
just

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,640
we're using json fields which allowed

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
you to

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
the ministry of health for example for

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,880
example to do

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,400
very good analytics from it okay so

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,760
hospitals will use

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:31,840
transactional uh relational databases

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,440
the system of health or the ministry of

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:38,000
health are going to be using

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,000
a more document oriented db

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,320
um this is pretty much what i was saying

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,600
before so

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,799
every person will become an old

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,360
you can you know update to your health

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,760
professional your information

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,440
the person is in control of what you

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,559
share actually you cannot share

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,280
anything if you don't want to um

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,880
and it will definitely decrease the load

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,120
on the public health system

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,919
okay at least that's that's what i try

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,000
to

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:16,240
achieve and then after you have

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,240
all of that stuff in place

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,840
this is kind of the the the good stuff

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,760
that

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,440
whether you are a research institution

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,559
or where you are the

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,120
ministry of health

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,600
you can start doing really good things

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,640
in

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,919
the uh genomics and

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,240
medical genetics area um you know there

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,760
are

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,720
so many natural variants that

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,720
they have unknown clinical significance

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,440
you know that there is a mutation

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,000
but you don't really know how much that

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,360
mutation will impact your health

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,960
and by having these very very large

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:02,559
databases you will be

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,760
able to kind of create or see this

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,960
correlation

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,760
between genotype and phenotype and and

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,880
hopefully

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,919
hopefully um detect

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,600
prevent detect and treat

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:20,880
better whatever condition it is

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,919
in in the areas of genetics and

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,240
epigenetics of course

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,600
so this is this is one of the really

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,880
awesome things that we

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,760
should be able to do with the federation

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,240
and putting the citizen in place there

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,600
will

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:41,440
actually exponentiate the uh

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,720
the good things about it

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,720
and and of course you will have uh

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,320
real time or the possibility of having a

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,200
real-time observatory

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,720
and and and reporting in for example in

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,039
the case of argentina

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,799
guinea health has been chosen as the

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,679
observatory for the committee

00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,679
in interviews

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,679
so you have different health centers

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,559
and at the moment that you have a

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,600
disease

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,000
that is notifiable whether it is

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,520
tuberculosis where is evil or whether it

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,559
is kobe 19

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,960
that information will go immediately to

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,159
the new health federation and the

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,919
ministry of health

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,520
will know the case in real time and

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,400
that's that's key okay you don't have to

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,600
wait

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,840
a weekend to know the

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,679
you know the incidence or the prevalence

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,799
on any disease no you will have that

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:41,520
information in real time so

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,520
instead of becoming an epidemic you can

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,840
cut it short

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,720
and any moment of the outbreak if you

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,679
have

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,640
the my if you have the new health

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,520
federation

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,000
in place in your province or in your

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,000
country

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,440
so um

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:07,039
what are the stuff that we

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,159
are doing today well pretty much

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:13,679
we are now linking

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,200
uh my new health to the federation

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,320
that's that's code that is

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,960
being in place you can check the code

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,000
at the mercurial repository at genu.org

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,720
and we should have a beta by december

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,440
um any questions that you might have you

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,320
can send it

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,679
to either to me or to info at

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,440
newhealth.org

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:40,080
or just join the uh

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,000
main list on the development mailing

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,520
list that's probably the best way if you

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,360
want to develop and help us

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,200
developing whether it's my new health or

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,799
or any of the other components of the

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,720
new health ecosystem

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,520
um to do um i was listening to richard

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,080
before

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,039
um well packaging is one of the issues

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,200
always right

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,880
what what is the best way to package new

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,080
health my new health

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,919
should we just do it a pipe i should we

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,279
just create a

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,520
a python package and just upload it to

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,760
pi

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:19,440
by or should we have an operating system

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,080
uh specific package whether it's for

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,520
freebsd or for opensuse or whatever i

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,520
know axel

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:29,840
it's already working on something like

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,840
that and i see his comments around there

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,360
that's fine that's that's perfectly fine

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,760
um

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,720
as in the case of the hospital

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,000
management information system

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:45,679
my goal is to kind of create

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,720
a generic vanilla distro

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,200
right something that is valid for any

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,840
livery operating system right so whether

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,360
you use

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,559
freebsd or openbsd

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,600
or opensuse or arch linux or whatever

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,679
you should be able to install it uh

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,120
in your place with of course the right

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,760
documentation in place right

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,919
and then if any of you guys want to do

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:15,840
as in the case of axel um

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:19,360
want to do something on on on opensuse

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,600
have the rpm ready that's great for me

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,360
as i said you know in the case of my new

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,559
health has to be something that is

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,159
easy because people has to be able to

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,600
install it as a matter of fact

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,480
for the pine phone i it just should come

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,080
pre-installed

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,240
and then if you want to delete it you

00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,480
can delete it but it's it's a way of

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,480
of making things easier um

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,600
connectivity with open hardware devices

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,159
and the documentation that is always one

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,520
of the things

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:52,080
and security right those are the things

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:55,120
that are in the to-do list

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,679
and um we have two minutes

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,480
this is one of the things that we have

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,600
in munich

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,840
we have an open source leap

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,120
community server so people can just log

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,240
in there and play around with the

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,240
with the federation or the hospital

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,799
management information system

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,960
and now that will have the

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,320
my new health in place in in a couple of

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,760
months so you will be

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:30,000
able to send test data there and

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,000
play with it so that's pretty much it

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,679
any questions will be

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,120
i'll be trying to answer so

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:48,159
thank you again for being here and i did

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:51,200
really enjoy the presentation

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,200
so um

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,200
lou was one thing does new health have

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
the survey

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,720
of four new patients was just

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,720
using the web-based server

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,520
no new general practitioner so that's

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,399
the question because this is the first

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,559
time that i kind of

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,520
use this interaction with my doctor and

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,000
it was a basic

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,559
survey for registration of new patient

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,760
you know like

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,279
regular one and it was quite cool but he

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,799
told me that you know like he has it for

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,679
two plus years and i was the first

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,320
person to ever

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,919
use it so that was quite sad but um you

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,640
know it's something like that part of

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:33,840
your suit

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,799
so so you mean a survey for exactly

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,480
before you ever

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,480
start with the doctor you know like he

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,559
wants to get some info about you before

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,080
he registers you and you kind of feel it

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,240
and then you can already use this

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,200
information contain vaccinations so i

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,960
took my you know

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,360
vaccination document i kind of copied

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,279
everything in there and diseases i don't

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,799
have any so it was easy to fill

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,559
you know maybe some if you have gum

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,240
license or whatever other

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,799
you know glasses stuff like that and he

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,720
found it

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,640
useful but again like nobody was really

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,960
using it but still if people would

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,399
it saves him a lot of time because he

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,840
has to enter that information to the

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,159
system right

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,440
right so so that would go a bit on on

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,480
the concept of the uh

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,840
the book of life or or the pages of life

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,960
anybody should be able to to um

00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:25,360
once you have your your federation id

00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,600
you should be able to upload part of

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,600
your clinical history

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,559
to your to your gp okay that answers it

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,960
thank you

00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,960
thank you

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:40,960
any other questions uh yeah i saw them

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,919
vaccinations diseases exactly

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,120
uh that would be part of the the citizen

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,080
and

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,559
and patient portal that that you could

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,799
also

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,799
use

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,919
great so sophie yeah i guess i guess we

00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,159
are run off

00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,279
time um does new health integrate with

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,919
digital

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:08,799
um you have different type of

00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:12,240
authentication um

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,159
you can use uh certificates uh or you

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,320
can use password-based

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,640
uh and it really really depends on the

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,760
legislation of every country but

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,000
you know that's that's one of the

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:25,039
beauties of

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,039
of libra software

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,600
right yeah you can even be anonymous i

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,960
mean that's

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,520
in argentina i have treated people

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,559
that not necessarily need to give your

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,640
information uh

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,760
and that's that's that's good that's

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,520
respecting

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,520
uh people's privacy uh

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,120
but i'm i'm a bit wary of you know other

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,679
type of

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,720
authentication that is by private

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,320
companies

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:04,159
so it should be a liberal way of

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,919
authenticating as we do it today

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
but i guess we are running out of time

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,320
we can go to the chat room

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,200
if you guys want and and leave the

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,440
others

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,559
right doc i think that we have we have a

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,679
presentation now

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,159
no no you can uh you can go on

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:22,080
there is a there is a break now oh good

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,760
oh okay

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,200
let me just check but if i'm not

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,200
mistaken now there is a break now

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,840
yes that's right so it's a break now so

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,840
you can go on this kissing if you want

00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,720
oh cool so so we have a you know

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,960
some minutes to to talk and discuss uh

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,360
about that yeah i mean um

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,320
the thing with healthcare deals a lot

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,919
with

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,679
legislations you know current

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:57,120
legislation some people say

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,840
well you know i i don't want to pass

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,240
any of my information or i want only

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:04,720
this

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,600
set of gps to know about my clinical

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,200
history

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:12,960
how can i do that in the

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,399
hospital management information system

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,720
uh it's it's very flexible okay we use

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,320
uh

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,720
triton uh as part of the framework and

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,840
and

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,960
at that level uh you can pretty much

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:31,440
set uh authentication

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,440
and and this sort of acls

00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,519
at the level of draw at the level of

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,880
field

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,519
and also depending on what type of

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,960
values do you have on that field

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,600
people should be able to access it or

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,760
not that's

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:54,880
that's that's doable the thing is

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,360
uh usually each country has its own

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,399
set of rules when it comes to health

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,919
data

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,320
and we pretty much have or whoever

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,480
implements that new health in that

00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:11,840
country has to abide

00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,840
by those rules okay um

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,840
what what i i like to see the scenario i

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:21,279
like to see is

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,279
um you know

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,240
i don't like for example to host

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:32,000
the federation in any private cloud

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,799
servers you know whether it's amazon or

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,679
whether it is

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,679
google or whatever

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,039
because of because of the type of data

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,080
that

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,200
you know these guys live on data and and

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,799
and we'd rather have our own

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,559
cloud if you will um

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:58,080
but it should be private

00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:01,360
okay it should be something that is

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,760
part of your health and your physicians

00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,360
and the system of health where you are

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,639
no private uh

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:14,399
company should be even

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:18,159
even hosting your information okay but

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,800
that's that's a personal uh

00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,599
choice at the end of the day it's new

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,200
health it's

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,200
it's libra software you can put it

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,919
wherever you want but

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,639
but it's important that you we have that

00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:33,119
in mind

00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:37,040
you know um at the end of the day it's

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,760
it's uh it's health right and and

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,320
the the weakest link will probably be

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,280
there

00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,800
where you are actually hosting your data

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,800
um

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,000
other than that you can encrypt a

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,760
different level

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,520
uh you can use different encryption

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,720
mechanisms uh

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,320
it's it's it's really in libraries it's

00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,800
i'm using an upg and i'm using the creep

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,359
b crypt for for some stuff for hashing

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,160
but but if you want to use another

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,440
libraries

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,720
it's it's uh it's doable

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,160
um the goal at the end the goal at the

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,640
end on this is

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:23,040
we want to have an ecosystem where

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:26,160
from the very smallest

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,839
component which is the the citizen going

00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,480
to family going to

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,480
society

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:38,720
we should be able to act in

00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,800
in a way that we can prevent

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,280
that we are not doing reactive medicine

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,400
as we are doing today in most of the

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,040
countries

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,560
and and the kovid pandemic has been

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,960
probably

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,040
one of the best examples that have shown

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,160
us that we are not doing good public

00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,560
health

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:04,160
care at all good public health care

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:09,119
deals with prevention deals with

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:12,960
keeping the people in a healthy state

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,960
um and not just curing them and not just

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,480
you know people goes to the doctor when

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,960
they feel sick

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,640
and that's the wrong approach people

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,920
should go to the doctor

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,680
to keep them healthy um because if you

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,839
are sick something is wrong right

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,119
something probably we should have done

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:32,640
something better

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,440
to prevent uh getting sicker and again

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,079
you know the way you eat the way you

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,079
sleep

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,480
the offensive affection level that you

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,480
have at home uh

00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,880
the the vaccination that those kids

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,920
should have had that they didn't have

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,680
probably is what are making them sick

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,359
um you know there are so many things the

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:56,320
education levels that

00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,720
that you have the nutrition level all

00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,760
this

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,760
stuff is in new health

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,880
and then yes of course you have state of

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,839
the art

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,280
genomics and and clinical genetics and

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:11,599
so on

00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,520
but new health is about social medicine

00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,079
it's about primary care

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,920
it's about keeping a society healthy

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,280
from all these socio-economic

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,880
determinants of health

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,170
that are being ignored most of the times

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,599
in many countries

00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,680
[Music]

00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,359
you know people think oh well we have

00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,000
the the latest

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:39,440
mris and we have the latest tomographers

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,800
and yeah but those only

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:46,160
most of the time detect a cancer

00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,640
that might have been preventable if we

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,119
did

00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,160
good preventive medicine if we did good

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,079
public health program for health

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,160
promotion and disease prevention and

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,200
that's where i want to focus with new

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,400
health

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,880
and with the application

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,040
that we have with my new health that i

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,000
think that that is going to actually

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,480
put the person on the driver's side

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,440
right

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,480
that's the on the driver's seat that's

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,599
that's

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:19,920
he or she is going to be

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:22,240
part of the system of health meaning now

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,720
you are also responsible you are not

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,079
only

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,680
taking orders from your general

00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,240
practitioner but you are also

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,760
going to be responsible for your health

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,720
and

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,119
you know i'm i'm quite excited on having

00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,079
this

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,359
new application you you know that there

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,320
are thousands of

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,920
of e-health and and mobile health

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,280
applications out there

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,320
but very few take this approach and and

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,079
actually connecting it to the to the to

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,599
the system or to the public health

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,119
system in your country

00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,240
uh i think it's going to make a a

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,359
a very important difference and let's

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,400
see how it's uh

00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,640
taken by um by our

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,160
uh politicians you know that's that's

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,640
one of the things that we have to do you

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,320
know we um

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,359
i see that alex alexander is is

00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,560
is here you know with this uh these guys

00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:20,240
uh

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,599
the free software foundation europe are

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,640
doing a great campaign

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,000
of uh public money public code

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,920
you know and and that's what

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,040
that's what we should talk to our

00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,960
politicians

00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,960
and talk to them you know say hey you

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,240
know why why don't you use liberty

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,599
software for healthcare

00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,800
what is stopping our countries to use

00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,160
free software or delivery software

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,160
in healthcare

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,000
you know it's the the tools are there

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,040
you know

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,560
and and if it's a it's a public good

00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,599
it's it's you know public health care

00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,440
should be universal and

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:09,440
we are in europe and our politicians

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,440
should legislate to use

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,200
whether it's new health or whatever

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,880
other

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:18,640
you know hospital management information

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,160
system that they want to use

00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,720
as long as he's libre it's fine with me

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
it's fine with me uh we are a social

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,599
project

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,200
you know we we are a social project we

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,839
are not

00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,480
into informatics we are into social

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:38,640
medias and we use

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,920
uh you know we use uh

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,280
technology to deliver this uh

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,400
social media let's see what that says

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,160
uh to most things i just had my

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,000
to call my local government to the

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,520
privacy evolution third party is saying

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,560
we're using collector

00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:58,960
for modern yeah exactly you know

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,400
it's it's it's it's always the same we

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,680
don't know what's going on

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,839
when when they came uh with the commit

00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:11,839
uh application here at the beginning

00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:12,319
uh on on the phones it was a closed

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,480
source

00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:17,359
application and i started tweeting and

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,200
calling and

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,280
and and and at the end now is it's uh

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,760
it's libra software it's it's the code

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,359
is there for the kobit 19

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,880
mobile uh application you know and that

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,000
that was good that was great

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,040
you know but if we wouldn't have called

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
them and tweet around that would have

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,200
remained

00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,599
closed and you know i don't want it a

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,079
close-sourced application

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,839
on my mobile phone especially on

00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:50,000
something

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:52,880
so critical

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,920
as as healthcare you know and that's why

00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,359
i

00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,960
i want to move or i want to have

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:04,400
these applications on phones

00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,839
that i know every single line of code of

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,079
the operating system

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:09,280
or at least i have the choice to go to

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,560
any single

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,640
line of code of that operating system

00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,040
and and you cannot do that with android

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,920
and of course you cannot do that on ios

00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,520
so

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,240
now with python i think that

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,280
we have a very bright future you know we

00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,000
have to support

00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,960
this sort of of projects you know

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,960
because

00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,240
that's the phone that i want to use on

00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,880
my daily basis

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,000
uh you know i i feel very comfortable

00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,400
using

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,359
you know whether i'm using open source

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,800
on my laptop

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,760
or or i'm using freebsd on some

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,200
of my servers i want to do the same on

00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,480
my phone

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,160
and also in the next step is

00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,359
any single hardware device

00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,040
that is related to health should be open

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,160
hardware

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,520
i want to communicate to uh

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,640
you know my pool oximeter

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,800
with something that i know that is

00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,920
actually sending that information only

00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:17,119
to me

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,040
same with all the glucometers you know

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,119
i don't know what are those doing you

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,240
know i want to have

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,440
all the circuitry of that glucometer and

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,760
all the protocols should be

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,839
open so we can connect now the pine

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,839
phone and my new health

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,400
to the oximeter and to the glucometer

00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:39,359
and to the tensiometer you know that

00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,359
that's beautiful

00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,920
because if we do that we are not going

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:47,040
to be making mistakes

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,920
uh when we are punching in

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:51,520
the blood glucose glucose level or your

00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,800
systolic or diastolic

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,640
uh pressure you know um if we have

00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,359
something that automates that

00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,400
and is open hardware then we have the

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,560
whole

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,960
circuit you know then then we close the

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,119
whole thing and that's

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,319
that's what we need to ask and then

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:11,839
there are some

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:16,960
some of them already um

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:16,960
that are open in that sense

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,640
oh windows xp no thanks no

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:29,440
anything that is um

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,480
and and that's you know again if you

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,480
want to use it

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,079
it's it's it's up to you i mean that

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,680
you can't compile i mean it's it's

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,240
python code

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:43,760
chances are you you should with some

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,200
degree of

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,000
of of work you should be able to run it

00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:51,839
on other

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,839
non-free operating systems

00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,079
but why i think that we are also sending

00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,720
a message

00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,720
to our society you know

00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,680
um

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:11,839
yeah i know it's it's

00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:15,040
it's it's terrible but

00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,560
that's what many or i would say

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,440
that's what most of our

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,960
governments are using today they are

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:26,160
using

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,040
non-livery operating system to run our

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,560
health

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,960
and to store our data and and i think

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,040
that

00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:40,319
we have a moral issue with that

00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:43,599
it's it's it's our moral duty to

00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:46,800
to talk to our governments

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,359
and yeah exactly you know that's what

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,319
happened

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,839
in the you know the uh i think it was

00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,200
like

00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:57,760
16 000 records in the uk

00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,119
of people that was positive and coveted

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:02,880
uh

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:06,240
on on the sarskopf to were not

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:07,920
entered because they were entering the

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,160
information on an

00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,640
excel spreadsheet you know it's it's

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,680
it's appalling you know it's so pulling

00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:19,040
i mean

00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,200
why doing so uh it's

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,200
it's it's it's just crazy you know

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,079
because at the end of the day

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,760
um there are good politicians but there

00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:30,800
are also

00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:33,359
many ignorant politicians that are

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:36,160
running our health care systems

00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:36,880
and you know it's it's it's our moral

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,640
duty

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:44,000
to take them away from the society

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,560
um because at the end healthcare is not

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,800
much

00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:52,160
about technology but it's about good

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:55,599
policies and good um you know equity

00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:59,359
and and universality

00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,359
and and good measures on that

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,319
okay excel after complaining about the

00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,359
use of prevalence

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,160
i got this reply

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,359
yes sorry that's in in german but it

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,200
just means

00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,359
um in public uh domains

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,119
people mostly really don't care about

00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:21,839
privacy or something like that

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,480
they say well if you sign the contract

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,119
and they say

00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,240
they're sticking to the law uh then

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,720
we're okay

00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,200
but that's reminds me on another

00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,200
sentence

00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,000
this is what the uh the leader of the

00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:40,640
former german democratic republic

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,839
said we are not building a wall once

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,200
they're starting to

00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:47,599
develop the berlin wall right so

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,200
we must raise much more awareness in the

00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,480
public sector

00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:54,720
um that this proprietary vendors

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,280
are not necessarily the place to hold

00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,280
our data

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:05,280
yeah and and you know what what

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,640
the guys at the fsf ee are doing i think

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,800
that that's

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,640
that's a great campaign and i think we

00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:14,000
should all

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,440
support them absolutely and and and work

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,400
with them they

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,440
they have good experience they have vast

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,720
experience

00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:24,240
on talking to politicians and to the

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,599
policy makers

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:30,240
and and sometimes sometimes politicians

00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:30,240
don't even know

00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:39,119
you know

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:42,720
so gabriele i made the italian voiceover
