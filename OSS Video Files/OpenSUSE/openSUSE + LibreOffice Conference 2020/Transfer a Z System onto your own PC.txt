Description: 
	How to emulate a Z system for application deployments on openSUSE 



Most Developers have got only their own hardware for development and are not able to test for other architectures. You will receive an introduction of how to test applications without any expensive Z system on your own PC with openSUSE for s390x. That will start with easy Z emulations and will be followed with a combination together with QEMU and container technologies. So you can have faster deployments at the end.
