Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/3448-opensuseway-is-a-full-wayland-de-based-on-sway



In this talk I would like to update ppl and gather some feedback on the state of Sway tiling Wayland compositor running as primarily desktop environment (DE) on openSUSE.

openSUSEway tries to be full DE that is built around Sway and I would share what issues are there and what is the path to the future.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,320
will talk

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,240
about the open source away as a full

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
wayland desktop environment based on

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,640
sway

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,160
i used to work at susan for some time

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,599
now i

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,400
work at barcona but still i support some

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,080
of the packages

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,960
in opensuse and i use tumbleweed

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,559
really well and a huge fan of the

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,280
opensuse tumble which will increase

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,079
if you want to contact me you can send

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,920
me email

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,680
or on github you can open issues or

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,559
something or maybe even on discord you

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,840
can

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,160
contact me there i'm an open community

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,160
as well

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,440
what is the open source way right

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,879
i had a talk before about it

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,479
and so you can find it

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,479
on my meetha your page

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,439
the last year on the

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,840
same disk conference

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,439
and you can found out the basics what is

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,720
that how it

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,920
works and etc after that we actually

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,320
created the portal

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,520
when they're much more extensive

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,280
information

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,799
what kind of packages you include it

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,880
includes and how it's configures

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,560
in the basic it's tries to create the

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,000
desktop environment

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,799
it's probably really good stuff for the

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,439
beginners that are starting with the

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,479
tiling

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,880
windows manager and maybe have some

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,320
issues to stop it from scratch this

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,840
provides you everything

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,680
and then you can customize it

00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:01,439
has login manager manager status bar

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,119
pre-configured the notifications as well

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,040
as the

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,959
sway itself it actually consists from

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,280
couple of parts one is the just a lot of

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,360
the config files

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,599
and some of the config files all and

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,200
also the spec files which

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:25,760
lives in obs it's a pattern that's

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,520
preset up the needed packages as well as

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,520
the open through the way itself

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:41,040
so so

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:44,720
that's lives on github and then the obs

00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,840
how it looks like and on the system

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,720
it's just the sway config

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,360
file the standard one that lives in utc

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,000
as well as

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,519
includes your own directory for

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,560
customization

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,280
and this system one the desktop

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,720
environment

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,760
which set up some of the more

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,840
controls for you uh

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,360
like rising the volume some of the

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,800
special key

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,920
buildings some of the

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,040
themes the

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,800
notificator and for example here is a

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,760
poll kit gnome authentication

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,799
agent which allows you to run as a

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,480
privileged user

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,640
for example running some application

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,080
that requires the privileges

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,480
and it will pop up and

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,040
ask your permissions like ask you a

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,040
password

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,760
and let's talk about

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,879
what is new uh since last time

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,239
so the new stuff

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,720
here is then for example

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
there was the community contribution

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,000
there is new

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,959
status indicator about the packages how

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
many packages

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
needs to be updated so it's queries it

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
and

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,200
show it down show it sits on

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,159
here and also if you click on that

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,680
it will run zippered up to update the

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,440
packages it will ask you if you

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,440
are you would like to proceed all of

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,600
that stuff

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,600
so

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,840
this uh actually done

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
in

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,400
in way bar so you can see this just

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,440
squares

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,880
number of packages and indicates it and

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,080
when you click it it surrounds the

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,080
terminal and just

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,360
update the repos and then do the zipper

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,320
dot

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,720
another feature that was added is the

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,960
grid

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:04,080
jitika grid d gritter supports

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:08,160
the gtk styles now

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,440
and we we added the styles here to match

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,440
all the experience so you see the

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,440
background and kind of

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,280
your style of opens to the way

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,240
so you can login into your

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,240
into their sway

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,600
another big topic uh for the sway

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,360
and wayland in general is the sharing

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,160
the screen applications

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,759
during the zoom calls or other video

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,880
conferences you would like to share

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,960
this screen not

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
all of the applications support well and

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,560
natively

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,840
or not all the protocols for example

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,039
zoom

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:59,120
doesn't support the sway out of the box

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,120
but we can

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,720
override that or just like

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,400
overcome that with using the

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,680
loopback device so

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:19,039
i set it up the

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,479
loopback module

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,600
in my system which allows me to share

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,720
uh some of the screen or part of the

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
screen all the screen

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,800
through the video device that's

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
presented as a video camera to the

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,120
system

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,720
so to do that you just need to install

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:41,900
the kernel module

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,280
for that as well as the tools are really

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,000
[Music]

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,840
heads handsome to actually find the

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,680
which device you use so um

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,560
for that you need to load that

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
module or you can probably start it up

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,479
automatically

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,080
i'm doing that by hand when i need it

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
after loading you can

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,840
start the recording and for that i use

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,000
vf recorder which

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,199
can share part of the screen or full

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,039
screen

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,720
uh so it's understand the available

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,919
protocol and

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,720
what it does it's actually outputs the

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,759
selected region and here i have just

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
press it

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,440
i have it set it up right i know which

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,160
part of the screen i'm sharing in my

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
talent

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,120
windows so i just uh

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:36,430
set it set that

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,759
geometry over here and i'm sharing this

00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,639
[Music]

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
resolution and for zoom it works the

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,319
best i think

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,680
there are some glitches depends how long

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
scales the image so

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,199
you can you can experiment and find out

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,639
by yourself

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,520
there are a couple of uh needed

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,680
keys for the loopback device those are

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,360
important and you can find them

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,639
on the vf recorder page

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,319
and here is the output right that's

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,560
where you streaming

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,879
this it should be a loopback device and

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,910
to find out the loopback device you can

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,319
use the

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:18,720
[Music]

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:23,199
ctl tool which you can just list

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:26,319
devices and you can see that

00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,599
the virtual camera loopback is set up on

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,479
the dev video zero

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,360
i have my external camera as well as

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,360
integrated one

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,519
now when we set up like we have ability

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,360
to stream

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,640
the part of the screen through the video

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,480
camera

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,720
interface uh we need zoom to work right

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,240
and zoom out of the box doesn't support

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,120
sway

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:56,480
so we set up

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,360
uh this way actually set up this

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,399
environment

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,959
xgg dexterous environment

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,959
so it's

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,720
it shows the sway right

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:14,240
and uh zoom doesn't know

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,480
about that let's run zoom and you can

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,760
see

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,240
[Music]

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:22,399
that it runs it's fine it's can actually

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,600
share my video i will i won't share it

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,160
but when you

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,640
push the screen it has the error message

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,399
that

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,760
it supports it only on normal

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,120
so i took it a little bit further and i

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,600
found out that sexually

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,600
can be uh really easily

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,160
fixed right so i just extend this

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,480
setting this so i just

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,680
override this environment for zoom

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:59,279
and that makes it think that's

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,279
knob so let's run through again

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,480
and you can see now

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
if i push share screen it's actually

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
have the share dialog

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,240
and here it's like you use the content

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,760
of second camera which will be loopback

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,880
device right now i use it for this

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,800
streaming

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,519
but it will be essentially the same so i

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,360
will just stream this part of the screen

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,600
so you can share with zoom and

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,399
everything works unexpectedly

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,399
so it can share

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,519
if you do not use flat pack

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,320
just prepend this environment

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,279
and run zoom like that it will work or

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,959
you can replace that in desktop file

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,240
if you would like to but some of the

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,920
applications actually support their

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:56,640
uh screen sharing

00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:01,839
from natively right for example jitsi

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,839
gtc supports the

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,839
screen sharing

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,440
out of the box with firefox

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,120
so that's you can see that's like i'm

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,560
just

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,079
sharing the same uh part

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,640
of the video and on my left side is my

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,279
obs

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,560
on my right side you see the part of the

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
screens

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,320
i am sharing so this shares the full

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,440
screen

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,440
which in my case is quite big so

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,200
the resolution is too big to share the

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,720
full

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,519
uh i mean it's not too big you can't

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,000
share that but you don't need that

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:57,920
i use flat park quite extensively

00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,880
and uh everything works for me like

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,920
obvious studio where i record in this

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,760
the slack video works everything works

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,040
and then the zoom telegram

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,480
uh so this xdg portals

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,040
the flat pack works really well what is

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,800
next

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:23,600
uh next is we have this

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,120
project and we try and plant what we are

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,000
doing

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,760
i would like to add the install this way

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
put those away into the installator but

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,320
for that i probably will need to add

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
some test

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
so it's some kind of for long time and

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
backlog but eventually maybe

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,040
i would find time or maybe someone will

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
contribute that

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,120
i think we will just continue to support

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,260
them

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,240
people ask questions open the issues and

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,839
[Music]

00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,399
further we'll try to improve the ui ux

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,279
for the open source away maybe adding

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,959
some application

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:04,079
scripts to do some stuff automatically

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,240
as better desktop environment you also

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,480
plan to go to user tc there are some

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:13,760
issues so we need to do that

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:18,240
and that's more or less it for community

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:20,959
another stuff that is in long

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,560
there is what maybe needs to be fixed is

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,760
just like how to

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,680
enable grid d as the default

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,120
uh display manager currently it's done

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,440
by hand

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,320
uh i think that's because the open

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,320
source

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,880
not it and not that i think it's for

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:40,160
sure pennsylvania

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,959
xdm i actually as default display

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,519
manager

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,120
its setups in the preset that uh

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:46,720
actually xdm provides the display

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,360
manager service

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,160
and that's a default and you need xdm

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,480
and i

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,959
actually don't like to add it because

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,160
it's full valent and i don't like like

00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,680
x anywhere i even

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,160
tried to maybe figure out how some rfc

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,160
how to fix that in the open source but i

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,600
mean this is just how open source works

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,079
it's used then

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,320
alternatives instead update alternative

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,680
instead of them

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,720
uh systemd and xdm servers actually

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,560
figure out

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,839
which display manager to

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,079
to check and you can actually figure out

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:29,440
this in the

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,000
documentation i would like to add

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
3d to preset but that's not possible

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,959
currently

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,440
uh maybe the drawer does it

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:42,480
differently maybe we should do that way

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,880
but anyway this is not critical to add

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,040
so i would like to thank to community

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,639
that people that contributed or

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,160
opened the issues with suggestions or

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:57,040
uh this notice

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,440
thank you everyone uh use open source

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,720
away

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,199
try it use open source use sway
