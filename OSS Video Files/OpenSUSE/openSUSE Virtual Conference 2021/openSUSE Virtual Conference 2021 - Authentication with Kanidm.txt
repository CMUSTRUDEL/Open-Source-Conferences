IDM above the Sea

Authentication and Identity Management are at the core of our systems security. Everyday we all authenticate to many systems, from out phones and laptops, to websites, servers and much more.

Kanidm is a new opensource IDM system that is developing rapidly, and promises many new features previously only found in cloud and identity as a service platforms. This includes webauthn, claims, ssh management, and much more. In this talk we'll demonstrate many of the features of this platform, how it's begun to integrate with opensuse, how it was made possible, and what the future holds for this growing project.
