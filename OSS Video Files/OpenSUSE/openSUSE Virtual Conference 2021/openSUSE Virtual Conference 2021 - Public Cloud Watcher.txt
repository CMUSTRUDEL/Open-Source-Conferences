In this presentation I would like to talk about Public Cloud Watcher https://github.com/SUSE/pcw. Tool used by SUSE SLE QE team to monitor Public Cloud providers ( Azure , AWS , GCE )  for testing leftovers and delete them. I will describe: 
1. tool itself ( internal architecture and features it provides ) 
2. how we maintain running instance of PCW ( it is deployed in 3 docker containers maintained by mixture of docker-compose, docker files and some bash scripts on top it )
