Hand editing config files for local deployment? Say hi to Avahi.

**Avahi: free configuration for your network service.** 
_(Live demo included)

If you've wondered how your Desktop Linux machine "discovers" items on your network, such as printers and file shares, this session will explain Avahi: the network service advertises resources across a LAN. 

The open source version of Apple's Bonjour/Zeroconf,  is a very flexible way to enable discovery of services.

We'll discuss how we used it in our deployment tooling , and we will demonstrate how to craft a configuration to discover custom resources for consumption by client software - enabling a true zero touch service installation.

Basic networking and python knowledge advantageous, but not essential.
