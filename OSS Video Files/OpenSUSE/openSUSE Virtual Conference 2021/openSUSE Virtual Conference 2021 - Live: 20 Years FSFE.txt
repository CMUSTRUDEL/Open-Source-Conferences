00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,799
work

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,120
so the fsfe is working to promote

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
software freedom

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,240
and empower users to control technology

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,400
we do that by promoting free software

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,840
also called open source software i think

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,960
i don't have to explain that into

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,840
details here

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,519
means that every person has the right to

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,960
use the software for any purpose to

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,039
study the source code

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,920
to share the software with others again

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,920
and to improve it

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,040
the fsfe's work can be divided into

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
three main areas

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,960
one area is the public awareness area

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,079
one about

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,879
one of the areas is our policy area

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,199
and the third one is the legal area and

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,760
uh i brought some examples from the last

00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,520
20 years we were founded in 2001 as an

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,199
independent sister organization of the

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,039
fsf in the us

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,320
and i brought you some examples of the

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,440
different

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,080
areas of work here and

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,080
yes so in the first one that's the

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,000
public awareness area

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,560
we participate in a lot of events during

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,159
the year as probably many of you as well

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,200
and while this the last months have been

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,520
mainly online

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,799
i hope that in future we will soon again

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,400
meet and

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,479
eat pizza together have great

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,799
conversations together listen to talks

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,040
while we are in the same room

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,880
so that's one one big part of of the

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,520
fsp's work that we are reaching out to

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,040
people

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,840
talking with them about our topics there

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,960
beside that we also have some

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,799
information material

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,119
on our website to make sure that

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,840
everyone in europe who wants to further

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,680
promote

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
free software that they can get

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,280
resources from us so it's easier for

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,799
you to promote free software towards

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,240
your peers towards friends

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:59,840
towards colleagues towards family

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,920
and yeah we also have some merchandise

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
especially now during summer when

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,280
everybody can see your t-shirt again

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,680
great opportunity to promote free

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,080
software there so you can go there at

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,319
the moment

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,120
we have some summer sale get some nice

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,520
t-shirts

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,319
and promote free software towards the

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,080
people around you

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,640
one other part in the public awareness

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,959
area is that since a few months now we

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,280
are also doing a podcast

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,120
so we wanted to make sure that people

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,200
who prefer more listening than

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,319
reading or watching that they also can

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,560
learn more about

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,599
software freedom and we did several

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
interviews there

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,920
like with corey doctorow about digital

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,599
restriction management

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,120
with kde with lawrence lessig here in

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,120
the picture about

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,560
code and other laws of cyberspace and

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,720
regulation in general

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
and several other interesting topics

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,840
there so if you

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,680
are into listening or if you haven't

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,720
tried it yet but want to

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,159
go on our website and check it out and

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,159
let us know how you like it

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,760
one other big area we one

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,680
other big larger topic we worked on for

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,640
several years since we were

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,800
since we were founded is that we worked

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,760
to counter software patents

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,840
so that was one of the convictions we

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,360
had that software paints are harmful for

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,959
software development

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,840
also harmful for free software

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,239
development so we worked for a long time

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,000
to

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,000
explain to the public and to wider

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,599
audience why patents are bad in the

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
software field

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,480
worked on that for many years prevented

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,159
some some policies there as well but

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,159
one of the main points there was really

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:46,640
to raise awareness in the public

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:49,680
that software should not be patented

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:52,799
one other part was that we sent

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,519
handcarves to the former pope

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
why did we do that well that was a part

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,560
of an activity called

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,159
document freedom day which we organized

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,439
for many many years

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:06,319
and the the idea of that activity was

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,280
to promote open standards and in that

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,920
case we asked

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,920
everyone around the world who of the

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,840
people out there would need more

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,120
education about open standards and free

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,359
software and we prepared an info package

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
to explain why free software is

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,800
important and why open standards are

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,320
crucial

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,600
and to make our point a bit

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,520
more yeah rememberable we added some

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,479
handcuffs in the packages

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,880
and to to show the vendor lock-in of

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,880
proprietary standards

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,160
and uh one of those uh proposals was

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
also to send it to pope

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,639
so we also sent handcuffs to the pope

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,479
together with the information

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
i never found out what happened with the

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,040
handcuffs there

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,280
on the other hand what i we we heard

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,919
about one of the packages

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,520
it was the former vice president of the

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,479
european commission she also got one of

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
those packages

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,160
and she actually then used the handcuffs

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,440
in one of her talks

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,560
and talked about the proprietary

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,600
and talked about

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,840
standards and why um my open standards

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
are important and that she's supportive

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,080
of that

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,639
and also showed the the handcuffs there

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,560
a few years later i also once met her

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,479
and she told me then the story about

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
some tricky situations with airport

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,639
security as she wanted to keep those

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,320
handcuffs and in the end had to give up

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,759
and hand them out to

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,520
airport security so yeah we we try to

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,479
raise awareness and sometimes also do

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,520
that by sending handcuffs

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,120
then also in this area we

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,440
handed out awards to to

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,440
to motivate people and organizations who

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,759
are already doing great things for

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,880
for free software open standards that

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,319
contacts mainly um

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,720
open standards and this is an example

00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,280
here

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
of the german public radio the

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,560
deutschland funk

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,919
and they were already very early on

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,639
using awkwarbiss

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,840
and other free formats then and we

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,440
handed them over

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,960
this nice cake there did the same for

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,560
target show in germany the first

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,680
television news broadcaster there and

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,720
they were using free video formats and

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
then a

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,759
german newspaper the tuts for using open

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,960
standards for their e-papers

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,759
and also without erm so that was

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
something which we

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
did for several years that we were

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
highlighting good work

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,600
done by other organizations so that it's

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
not always about criticizing but about

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,560
encouraging people to

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
to continue with their good work

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,440
one other area one other activity we do

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,520
regularly

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,440
to raise more awareness and to also make

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,479
sure that free software communities a

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,120
little bit more

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,240
pleasant place to uh to be involved in

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,880
is that every

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,479
year on the 14th of february we organize

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
the i love free software day

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,400
so we encourage every one of you

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
everyone else out there to say thank you

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
to other free software developers out

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,639
there

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,319
out of the software contributors tell

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,639
them that you like their work

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,599
thank them for their contributions and

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,440
make sure that

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,639
besides sending feature requests back

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,960
reports or

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,680
criticizing others work which is also

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,599
important

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,199
that we make progress and improve that

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,919
you also don't forget about

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,400
uh saying thank you so if you haven't

say thank you to a few colleagues from

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,599
opensuse from other communities

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,120
so yeah that's something which is which

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
we have done now for many many years

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:49,840
furthermore a bit more technical area

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,560
we um for many years worked on

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,639
the free or android campaign where the

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,280
goal is to make sure that you can use a

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,759
phone with

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,639
as much free software as possible that

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:02,639
started already in

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:04,319
2013 i think and

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,240
we're running that for several years

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,720
then and um

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,639
so we did workshops for people to flash

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,599
their phones we did workshops to show

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,240
people how to

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,360
use um free software app stores on their

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,360
phone or

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,759
for developers how they can get their

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,720
apps into those free app stores

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,560
and that's actually one of the

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,080
activities which in the next months we

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
want to

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,759
start more again so if you're interested

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
in helping people to

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,360
install free software on their mobile

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,760
phones uh different

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,640
uh solutions there please get in touch

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,399
with us

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,399
we would like to organize more workshops

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,959
again there in the next

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,919
several months so that will be very much

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,919
increased again

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
so yeah especially if you have some

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,800
technical expertise there

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,200
we would be very happy if you join us

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,200
for this

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,120
furthermore we wanted to raise more

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,920
awareness about

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,000
public administrations doing advertising

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,959
for proprietary software and why this is

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,680
bad

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,800
for this we were running our pdf readers

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,200
campaign

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,600
so you see it on the left side there's a

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,320
website promoting a proprietary pdf

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,160
reader

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,640
and they tell you that well if you to

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,320
to to open those files you need this

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
proprietary

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,480
pdf reader and yeah the goal

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,880
there was to get this removed and

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,640
uh we thought it is that this is a bad

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
practice it would be comparable to an

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,320
advertisement on the

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
on the highway that you can just drive

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,240
on this road with a

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
car from this manufacturer and you can

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,040
do greatest test drive

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,399
at your car shop around the corner so

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,080
what we did there was we with the help

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,240
of many people out there gathered all

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,800
the addresses of public administrations

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,240
who

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,480
are doing such advertisement then we

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,720
send a lot of letters out because we

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,800
decided that sending letters is more

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,080
successful there than if you just write

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,680
emails

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,959
and then we contacted all of them and um

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,760
yeah for this we had uh in the end we

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,880
contacted

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,320
over 2 100 public administrations all

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,320
around europe

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,160
and uh have been able to get 1125 of

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
them removed so over 50

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,600
success rate there also the german

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,480
government afterwards uh recommended our

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,160
um tech snippets uh to include in

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,000
websites so that you don't promote just

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,160
proprietary software but that you say

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,399
that there are also other free software

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,399
solutions for this

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,480
um during the campaign also the

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,560
pediatrium sources which is the powering

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,399
chromium which is displaying pdfs

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,760
was also published under free software

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,480
license before that part was

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,040
and yeah so on the left side you see one

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,480
of my

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,640
favorite examples that's um that's in

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,880
in german but i will quickly read it out

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,920
so it's from the city of hamburg and

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,480
they say

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,839
um decide for free software pdf reader

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,240
there are many programs

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,720
to read and write pdfs the following

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,200
list of pdf readers is vendor neutral

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,440
all those programs offer software which

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
respects your for freedoms to use study

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,959
share and improve

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,720
this gives you control over your

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,920
computer and helps you to protect your

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
privacy

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,160
and all of that was for many years

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,959
visible on

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:28,160
hamborg.e adobe

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,839
so going we already

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,320
went more a little bit to the policy

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,959
area so

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,000
we did one other activity uh where we

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,600
continued with

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,440
approaching public administrations

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,320
directly together with

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,560
opensuse as well and many many other

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,560
organizations so that's our public money

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,320
public code campaign

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
i think i don't have to go into the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,160
details here because yesterday bonnie

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,800
maring was already giving a whole talk

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,040
about

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,240
the campaign and how you can use this

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,480
framework to

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
get active yourself approaching public

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,440
administrations like

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,760
um your university school the

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,560
um public administration in your city

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,360
and so on

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,720
so just if you haven't seen it yet then

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,920
check out the

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,920
talk by her as well there what we did

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,160
there was we were reaching out to

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,519
many many politicians raising awareness

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,720
about the campaign

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,920
by sending each politician there

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,760
letters with roses to remind them about

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,160
about free software we developed a

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,920
brochure with more information about

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,240
public money public code

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,480
and why you should use free software in

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,600
digital infrastructure of the

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,760
of the government and public

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,880
administrations you can order those

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,480
materials

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,560
like the other materials i mentioned

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,920
before on our website in

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,279
german and english it's printed there

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,720
are some other language versions

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,320
available there

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,480
yeah one other area which we were

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,680
doing lately was which we were involved

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,000
lately was

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,680
in general discussions in the policy

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,959
field about free software

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,320
during the pandemic and that was

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,200
something where we

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,279
meanwhile accomplished that uh free

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
software is kind of the gold standard

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,120
for

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,399
all kind of apps around uh fris about

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
the pandemic

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,760
so meanwhile it's not just us who have

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,399
to

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,160
remind people about la is that is that

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,839
software is that app now free software

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,320
is that software free software but

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
many many other organizations joined in

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,639
there and

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,040
it's always asked about this aspect as

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,240
well

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:41,440
so that's a very positive part there and

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,399
with the german corona tracing app

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,399
uh this one actually also is now

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,399
published in afroit thanks to the

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,680
work of several volunteers there

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
especially from

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,839
micro g as well who made it possible

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,720
that you can run this corona tracing app

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,680
now without any proprietary software on

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,680
on your phone beside that there were

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,959
also lots of discussion about

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,320
in general sharing software to tackle

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,120
the pandemic

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,839
about toolkits to share with each other

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,120
and

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,800
a large part there was also that

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,639
there were many discussions and

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,040
statements happening during

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,240
that time where it became more and more

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,560
clear that the

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,760
arguments which we used before for many

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,399
years to

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,920
talk about um talk about software

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,720
freedom that they are now way better

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,920
understood

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,000
and that it's way more

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,360
in the top of the head of the people

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,880
that you

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,639
cannot counter global problems if you

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,160
don't work together on global solutions

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,600
but everyone is just doing

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,600
things on their own with rit

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,519
furthermore for public money public code

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,160
one uh

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
one important step there is also that we

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,519
are getting support by

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,000
more and more different political

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,199
parties in the whole party spectrum

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,680
so um two years ago the decision

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,440
from the biggest european conservative

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,839
party the german cdu

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,519
was to support public money public code

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,600
the publicly financed software should be

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,320
published under free software license

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,519
that's a big step of course a lot of

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,920
implementation is

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,839
still missing there and we have to

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,720
follow up there and remind people

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,560
remind politicians all the time but also

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
getting such announcements

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,320
and seeing that from parties who have

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,759
blocked the adoption of free software

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,720
for many years before

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,720
that's a big step which was now

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,759
happening there over the last

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,759
couple of years

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,320
moving over to the topics which are

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,680
slightly more

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,880
league in the legal area and

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,880
which also again display that dfs fee is

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,680
often working for many many years on a

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,240
topic to

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,000
to make a change there so you've seen it

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,320
before with the software patents

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,079
and with public money public code they

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,600
were running for many years

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,279
and here the the case about microsoft

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
that was something which went on for

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,399
over 10 years

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,040
so the european uh commission

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,000
found microsoft guilty of anti-trust

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,680
behavior

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,160
uh that they used a monopoly in the

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,800
desktop market to also get a monopoly

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,079
in the workgroup server market and we

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,079
were supporting the

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,920
european commission in this and then

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,680
when microsoft sued the european

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,839
commission in front of the

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,880
european court of justice we were also a

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,680
third party

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,000
supporting uh the european commission to

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,839
up

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,279
uh hold the their claims to um

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,759
against microsoft in the end microsoft

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,199
had to pay a fine of 860 million euros

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,199
there

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,959
on the other hand over all those years

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,399
we have seen that they have spent over

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,000
three um

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,519
um uh three million and billion

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,199
um to to get uh to buy people out

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,279
and other organizations out of this with

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,959
some other um agreements

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,240
and then afterwards some parties said

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,199
that they are not interested in it

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
anymore

00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,600
and at the end fsv was one of the only

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,360
third parties still involved in this

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,720
case

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,959
so that was very long work there but it

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:20,079
was important to make sure that

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,319
the that free software solutions can

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:26,559
compete with microsoft in this area

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,559
like in this case samba for example

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:35,840
now one other area

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,520
of importance is to make sure that

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,080
there is a better understanding of the

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,160
legal aspects of free software

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
so in the early years we have seen that

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,000
many companies

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,760
they did not adopt free software because

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,760
their legal department thought that

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,120
they cannot do that because else they

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,440
might have to publish

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,320
all the code and all the data from from

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,039
the company

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,640
just as an example there and also

00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,600
developers wanted to use more free

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,520
software

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,360
for uh for the company for their

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
products they were blocked by the legal

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,559
department

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,280
so that was one of the reasons why we

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:12,640
were setting up a legal network

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,559
and um bringing to bed bringing together

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,799
people from

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,160
legal experts like lawyers compliance

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,720
engineers and so on

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,880
to discuss legal topics and legal

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,360
questions about free software

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,919
and we meanwhile have over 400 members

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,400
they are worldwide

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,440
on a mailing list and they can discuss

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,640
there without

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,720
having to fear that their name or

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,960
what what a certain person they are said

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,000
will be made public

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,160
we also organize a yearly conference

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
under the same circumstances so that

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
they can talk openly

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,480
learn from others see what what they can

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,120
do

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,039
to to make better and more informed

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,080
decisions about free software legal

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,760
topics

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,120
and one of the experience we made there

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,720
was that by

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,480
learning from some other peers who are

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,880
in similar situations but for another

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,400
company maybe even competing companies

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
but they hear from them how they are

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
handling legal topics there

00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,039
that it was way easier for them to also

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,000
make those changes in the company so

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,600
that

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,120
it enabled them to use more free

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,480
software and also to publish more free

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,400
software in there

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:28,400
in their companies

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:31,600
recently we also started with um

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,640
with reuse dot software and

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:38,880
reuse software the goal there is

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,640
to make it easy for humans and machines

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
to understand copyright and license

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,120
information of

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,840
different components of the software you

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,039
can check that out on reuse dot software

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,640
and see that's very simple to follow

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,280
those guidelines

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,200
and it's something that the linux kernel

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,880
is now also constantly working since the

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,880
beginning to implement

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,320
the kde framework meanwhile is

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,120
completely

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,480
is reused compliant there we also saw it

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,880
with the ios

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
version of the coronavare app which i

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,559
mentioned before

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,080
and there are many more who now

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,120
implement this in their

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,159
in their um software so it's it's

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,320
afterwards better um to understand what

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,960
the original author of that software

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,200
wanted to

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,200
do with this with the software and that

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,640
you can be compliant with that

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,039
so check it out it's very simple um the

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,360
guideline you also have some

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,240
some api there and you can integrate it

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,400
in the ci

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,919
and yeah if you have any questions there

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,559
just contact us

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,520
one thing at the moment is that we just

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,080
a few days ago

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,960
announce reuse booster that's a program

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,360
where you can

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,600
apply or you can tell others to apply

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,080
there that the fsv is helping them to

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,240
make their software reuse compliant

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,520
so it's afterwards easier to also use

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,520
this components

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,880
in other software again or in general

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,720
that it's easier for

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,919
others to reuse it without having to

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,919
fear about legal problems

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,480
we did similar work there for an um

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,440
for european commission project which is

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,720
in the

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,120
next generation internet so

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,640
um we what we are doing there is we are

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,640
part of consortium

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
where people apply with their ideas

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,840
about software projects

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,760
and then the consortium they help those

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,640
projects to

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,480
to be successful with their projects and

00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,200
our part there is that we are checking

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,440
those

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,120
projects for free software license

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,120
compliance and help them with legal

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,600
questions about their projects

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,640
so till now we have checked over 120

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,080
projects there

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,240
help them to better understand free

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,480
software licensing made sure that they

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,799
can concentrate more on the hacking

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,159
and we help them to deal with the

00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,600
obligations they have from the legal

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,679
side

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,400
32 projects there already also

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:05,840
implemented the reuse guidelines there

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,280
and by the end of uh of this year

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,679
we will then have around 150 projects

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,919
which

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:15,679
are published then as free software

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,679
financed through the european commission

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:24,480
continuing now on the legal policy

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,480
part is we are

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,760
involved with the radio equipment

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,919
directive

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,960
so the radio equipment directive is a

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,039
regulation

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,360
for wi-fi routers mobile phones or

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,720
embedded devices which have any way of

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:42,400
um of

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:45,200
connectivity with others so and

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,799
what we are what this regulation does

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,600
there is it makes it

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,200
very hard to modify the software on

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,360
other devices

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,320
and that's something which we see as a

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,559
great threat for

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,320
free software that you are not allowed

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,480
to make modifications to the software on

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,720
your devices

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,480
and that's why we were participating

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,679
there in many consultations and meetings

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
about this

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,039
we also published a legal study on this

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,799
topic

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,640
and together with several technical

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,679
experts in the radio

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,520
area we are following up there

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,200
and constantly and raising awareness

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,840
there trying to make

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,280
sure that the regulators there

00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,159
understand that this would

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,880
have a negative impact for free software

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,400
and

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,200
why they should find some compromises

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,240
there how to

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:39,440
how to do this regulation

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,559
so that part is at the moment a bit uh

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,520
in in the yeah it's it's progressing not

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,320
that fast but

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,159
uh on the on the other side slightly

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,600
connected to this is also from the

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,559
networking area

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,880
we are for many years already active in

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,400
the

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,279
um to work for route of freedom so

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
that's the um that's the right to choose

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,240
your own device

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,640
which you can then have between your

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,960
home network and the internet

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,080
and we have been quite successful there

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,120
in germany from

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,360
2013 to 2016

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,679
to make sure that this even came into

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,400
the core uh coalition agreement there

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,480
and then it was um it was made clear

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,600
that in germany you can decide

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,760
which router you want to have at home

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,159
and the internet service provider cannot

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,440
force you to choose a certain device

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,679
and that's important so that you can

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,640
also run your own free software on free

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,840
software there on

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,520
on this device now it went up to the

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,600
european level

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,600
and we again had to work hard with

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,159
several technical experts there with

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,919
cable modems dsl modems and so on to

00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,120
counter all the different arguments

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,679
brought forward by

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,240
internet service providers there at the

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,440
moment

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,600
it's um it the different

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,120
different countries in europe they

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,440
should implement this

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,400
so we are heavily working together with

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,520
organizations

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,480
in austria and germany and greece

00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,240
and i want to work with other with other

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:12,240
organizations other countries there

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,720
as well to prevent this regulation to

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,840
end up in you being forced to use a

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,559
certain

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,000
router at home and not being able to run

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,679
free software there

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
if you are interested there we just

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,679
recently published an activity package

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
which helps you to get active on these

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,480
points

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,640
so check that out on our website we

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,600
would highly appreciate it especially if

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,360
you are in some other

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:37,440
eu countries which are not yet listed

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,440
here so please reach out to us there

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,400
furthermore all those activities which i

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,799
just mentioned as some examples of the

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,159
work

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,600
that happened in the past 20 years

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,679
most of that work is done by volunteers

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,720
and so we have volunteers on one side we

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,279
have the

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,360
we have staff but we would not be able

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,679
to get such a reach and

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,919
achieve such results without a large

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,679
amount of uh of volunteers who help in

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
many different areas from the

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,200
work groups who work on the specific

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,400
topics i just mentioned

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,799
but also on some other levels like

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,840
participating at local meetings and

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,240
organizing

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,039
local events to promote free software

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,360
there

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,760
or some online discussions giving

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,240
feedback about proposals

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,559
we also have teams to translate and

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,480
proofread so a lot of our website is

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,080
translate and material is translated in

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,240
many different languages

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,840
so if you are interested to help there

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,120
or you know people who want to help

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,200
there beside doing

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,559
volunteer work for opensuse that's

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,600
highly appreciated there

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,760
or if you want to participate at

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,600
organizing booths for us also like at

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,840
some street festivals or

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:53,760
other events all this is then done by

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,600
by volunteers there and

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,960
why are we doing all of that what i just

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,279
mentioned

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,000
as i said in the in the beginning it's

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,320
mainly

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,480
to make sure that we have a right for

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,880
software freedom so that everyone

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,960
for any purpose without any negotiation

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,960
and often not actually the need to read

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,760
the license can use it for whatever they

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,400
want

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,240
that you can study analyze learn and

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,159
discuss about the software

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,960
that you can again share it with others

00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,120
so you can distribute publicly to help

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,520
some others also to earn some money with

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,240
it without any permissions required

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,960
and to further improve it adopt it

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,919
extend it

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,080
fork it repair it because we believe

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,240
that that's important for a digital

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,440
society where more and more is

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,799
controlled by

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,080
computers around us

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,000
so i would like to thank all of you here

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,559
for the work you are doing for software

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,080
freedom

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,640
around opensuse i am greatly convinced

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,799
that

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:58,399
you can achieve change in society by

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:01,200
many many people doing many many things

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:03,600
and then in sum together those things

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,279
all together they will make a change

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,880
and that's why i would like to thank you

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,760

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,039
we should continue to do those small

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,880
little things

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,760

event

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,399
i know that's a lot of work to organize

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
