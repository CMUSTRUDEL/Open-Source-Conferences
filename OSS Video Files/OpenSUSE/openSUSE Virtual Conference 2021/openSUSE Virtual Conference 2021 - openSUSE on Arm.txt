00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,160
hello everybody

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,200
welcome to the open season arm talk at

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,199
the open source virtual conference

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,520
we will see what happened since the last

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,320
open to the liberofish conference

00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,320
in the arm world

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,760
the agenda for today is the following i

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
will start with a

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,239
quick introduction to of myself

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,040
and we'll have an overview of open

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,160
source on our workflow

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,120
and we'll talk about open build service

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,559
and open qa

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,879
also tumbleweed cubic microwaves

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,879
and the leap and step projects

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,760
and we will have a little word about

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,840
opensuse wiki

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,840
and finally the to-do list

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,640
so who am i i'm guillaume garde i'm a

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,040
member of the open sourcer community for

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,840
years now

00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,560
i'm engineer at am part of the distro

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,840
team

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,240
from the uss group i'm dedicated to

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,280
suzu and open sources since 2018.

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,560
i'm a member of the open-source team

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,680
taking care of our architectures

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,960
my main focus is about ar64

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,960
the 64-bit flavor

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,960
and we have support for these

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,159
architectures in

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,000
tumbleweed and lip

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,200
the same for mv7 tumbleweed and lip are

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,040
covered

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
but for mv6 uh it's tumbleweed only and

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,159
it's more in

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:56,159
maintenance mod no big

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,159
things happening on mv7

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,079
now we'll have a quick overview of open

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,759
season arm workflow

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,560
to understand how to to update things

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,239
and

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,599
get new packages or updates

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,599
in the distribution for arm

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
we'll start with an overview of opensuse

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,480
workflow

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,480
for x86 uh we have

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,160
a project called factory in obs where we

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,599
build packages

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,480
for x86 and

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,720
if factory finish to build a new

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,280
snapshot is pushed to

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,200
open qa and if open tray is green

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,920
or if you if we choose to ignore some

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
failures we can release this snapshot to

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,640
the users

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,239
and we call it tumbleweed

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
if you want to update something in

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,560
factory we need to submit

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,080
the update to the factory project

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,120
and we have a process of

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,800
review automatic review by bots

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,239
and some manual review we have also

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,800
pre-integration testing with open qa

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:24,879
and few install checker

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:28,400
few bots to check if everything is okay

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,000
and if this submission is accepted

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
the package is updated in factory we

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
need to wait

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,920
for the build to finish and again it is

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,040
a new snapshot is pushed to open qa

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,120
and then it will be released to

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,959
to the user as tumblry

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:55,519
so this is for open scissor

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,519
factory and tumble read for x86

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,360
now for arm the project is not open to

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,080
the factory

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,239
in obs but opens to the factory arm

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,920
which is a link

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,040
to the x86 project so all sources are

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,879
reused

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,840
and updated in real time and we

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,880
just have a small overlay to under the

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,320
snapshot version

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,759
for arm and the content of iso

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:30,160
and ftp trees which might differ from

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,040
x86 ones so if you want something

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,080
to be updated and tumbled with forearm

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,639
you need to push it to

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,320
open to the factory project and it will

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,680
be inherited in

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,960
am sub project

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,000
for open scissor lip 153

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,040
it's a bit different now because

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,639
it used to be a separate project for arm

00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,479
but now air 64 is directly included

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:04,560
in opensuse leap153 project so

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:07,680
it will be easy for error 64.

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,039
but for mv7

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,919
we are not included in 15-3 projects

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,720
so we still have a sub-project which is

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,280
open to the leap153 arm

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,880
and this project links to opencclip153

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,400
and also to step projects i will give

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,400
more details about it later

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,520
so if we go back to the workflow

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,000
for am for tumbleweed

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,520
you need to submit your update to

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,639
factory

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,840
i mean the x86 factory protect

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,120
then sources are inherited in real time

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,199
by the project

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,400
on the brill finish in the amsterd

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,440
project

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,280
a new snapshot is pushed to open qa for

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,639
armor

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,360
and if it is grilliness it will be

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,639
pushed

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:13,360
to to the user's

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,360
release as tumbleweed for arm

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,639
and again if open tray shows some

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,160
blockers the snapshot is not released to

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,120
the user and

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,840
you can fix it by your new submission

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,919
and

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,360
the next snapshot is tested test it

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,919
again

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,919
and so on

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,479
now we have a word about

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,000
open build service the obs

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,400
the good news is we will have more build

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,919
power for arm

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,080
in obs rather soon

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,599
but we already have enos build power for

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,199
r64 to enable

00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,319
rings rebuilds so we have two rings

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,360
a small ring called bootstrap

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,360
and a bigger ring called minimal x

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:13,360
where we have core packages

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,360
which can be rebuilt

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,080
at all the time so the first one

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,240
rank 0 bootstrap is green already

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,199
but we still have few build failures to

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,599
fix in

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,120
minimal x unfortunately we

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,280
don't have enough build borrower to

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,759
enable staging projects for

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,280
r64 so we only have staging projects for

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,560
x86

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:45,680
which already discover some problems

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:49,039
which are common between architectures

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,080
and of course since the

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:55,120
the last talk we we fixed a lot of build

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,120
failures for armor

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,160
few build statistics from last week

00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:03,599
[Music]

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
it's for open to the tumbleweed for ir64

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,000
and

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,520
x86 so you can see that

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,319
build failure and unresolvables are

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,960
mostly the same between both

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,960
architectures

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:28,240
from open qa so the current situation

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:31,759
is we have a local worker

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,399
which is a d05 machine which allows us

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,240
to

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
to have 16 camera workers

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,800
but we also have remote rockers

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,279
so we have two amazon web service

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:51,120
machine so the first one is a a1

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:54,240
with only three camera workers and also

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,120
an m6g machine

00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,480
which allows us to have 10 chemo workers

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,480
which are llc capable

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:09,600
we have also a part-time worker which is

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,240
based on a honeycomb lx2k and

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,560
allow us to have three gaming workers

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,600
this machine is only part-time because

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,720
it's also used to to build some packages

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,360
locally

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,680
so it's not online all the time

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,360
and we also have some real hardware

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,160
tests

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,880
thanks to the general hardware back-end

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:36,240
so we have a raspberry pi 2

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,480
which is an mv7 machine and we also have

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,560
a

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:46,080
raspberry pi 3 and one raspberry pi 4

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,080
both of machina ir64

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,959
few values from last week

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,080
so you can see that we have lots of

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,240
tests

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,240
for tumbleweed for arm

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,440
we are still behind x86 but

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
we already have a good coverage

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,839
regarding tumbleweed microres

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
cubic and lip

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,320
we still have automated email

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,279
notification with main changes

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,720
which are sent as soon as a new snapshot

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,160
is released

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,640
which is great to get the measure

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
changes

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,800
please note that only the changes from

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,839
packages

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,839
present on the dvd are shown not the

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,240
full changes on the ftp tree but still

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,160
it's

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
a good overview of the changes

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,880
of course lots of packages have been

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,680
fixed

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,560
can be at build time in obs or at

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,000
runtime

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,200
thanks to open qa we have

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,079
always new packages and new system new

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,160
devices support and new features

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,200
thanks to the up-to-date kernel and

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,160
up-to-date user space

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,920
also some systems moves away from

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,360
country projects in obs

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,360
to the main tumbleweed

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,320
we have some um specific features

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,959
additions

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
so you can go to the wiki on the amer

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:35,839
architecture support

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,880
to get the latest information

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,519
so we had already lsc atomics

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:46,000
enabled since june last year

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,600
recording pointer authentication and

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,959
branch target identification

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,720
bti we already had

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:57,920
kernel space support from

00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,200
june and august last year but we

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,079
now have also user space support

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
since november

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,200
another features is memory tagging

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,480
extensions empty

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,320
so we have user space support

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,440
since february and kernel space support

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:26,720
since may camera space support is

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:30,880
has been added in kernel debug flavor

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,880
thanks to the hardware cassand

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,399
regarding leap153 the big news is that

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,279
air 64 is now part of the main lip 153

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,200
project

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,200
it's not in a separated project anymore

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,320
[Music]

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,440
how is sleep built nowadays

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,279
it's very simple because we get

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:01,920
315 sp3 binaries rpm packages

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:04,160
for core packages i mean gcc canal cameo

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,519
and then we have additional packages

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,680
from package hub

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,480
project and finally we have

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,320
few packages added on top mainly for

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,519
branding

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,760
and thanks to all those packages

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,920
we have leap153

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,440
of course during the development a lot

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,720
of package

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,760
have been fixed can be at build time or

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,800
at runtime and finally we get

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,760
only 15 build failures for r64

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,760
in package up

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:49,040
for mv7 it's a bit different because

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:53,920
we cannot be based on

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:58,320
rpm from sleep to the enterprise

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:02,240
rpm because mv7 is not supported there

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,680
so we need to rebuild packages for mv7

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:10,000
from three sources this is done in

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,160
step projects and

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,440
these step projects are only used for

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,440
mv7

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,440
for now but it could be used for

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,440
additional architectures in the future

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:25,600
if you want to get more information you

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:29,199
can go to the open scissor wiki

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,600
on portal leap slash opensuse step

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:36,079
page i also linked

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,600
the announcements for mv7 support for

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,360
oly 153

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,839
if you want to read it you can go to

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,839
news.opentsu.org and you will find it

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
easy

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,519
the information is leap153 for mv7 is

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:59,760
not yet released because it's still a

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:03,279
work in progress

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,320
regarding the open scissor wiki

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:11,920
the main entry page is a

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,639
arm portal and we have updated few pages

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,160
in the arm

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,440
namespace the first one is of course

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,600
the portal itself portal arm

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,880
and also other compatibility layer pages

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,079
have they have been updated

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,120
and hdl pages are now

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,160
possible by system and chip

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,079
which can be easily for for people to to

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,279
browse

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,920
and of course um as i told you

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,040
before page with latest status of

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,199
america

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,680
extensions enablement is kept up to date

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,839
so it's on arm underscore architectures

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,839
underscore support

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,600
finally we i will have a word about the

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,040
to-do list

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,720
so we need to release lib153 for mp7

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:12,320
as soon as it is ready i don't have any

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,680
eta yites we need to improve

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
continuously the wiki

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,399
with new information and up-to-date

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,000
information

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,800
so if you have something to to write on

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,160
your

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:29,519
on board please do it

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,399
we need to improve obs as well

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,160
we need to to enable arm build on more

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,959
devil projects

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,279
to catch failure as soon as possible if

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,279
you

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,000
if we detect the boot failure in the

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,000
devil project

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,720
likely it will not reach up onto the

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,279
tumbleweed

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:54,639
and will save a lot of time

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:57,600
so if you have some packages in your

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,000
own devil project please enable arm

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,319
build

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,360
especially for ir64

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:11,760
we can still improve open qa

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,559
we can likely add more ir64 test

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
we could also extend the general adware

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,520
backend

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,240
which is used for real hardware backend

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,039
currently

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,039
mainly for raspberry pi 2 3 and 4.

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,360
my main ids are to add support for hdmi

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,400
to

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,320
usb devices which will allow to check

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,600
the screen output of the

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,760
of the machine currently we only

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:43,919
test through a secure shell connection

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,559
of our network we could also add usb

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,360
gadget support to send mouse and

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,360
keyboard events

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,760
we continuously monitor build and test

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,799
failures

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,840
so we need to fix the failures as soon

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,840
as possible

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,799
we need to report and our fixed bugs on

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:14,799
opensuse pixilla

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:18,400
can be done upstream as well

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,640
and we need some help to test and get

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,120
feedback on systems

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
could be small boards or big servers

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:34,720
even if all is fine please report

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,480
the status you can help us to update

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,760
some software as well

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:44,080
to add new features for example

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:47,120
we added vulcan to to measure package

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,120
recently for armor

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,080
and we could have some help also on wsl

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,280
support

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,720
in obs for ir64 so we have a working

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,919
progress project

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,240
in my home name space

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,400
so if you want to to help please reach

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,400
out

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,640
if you want to join the arm team you can

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,000
do it on

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,039
irc so it's still still the open souza

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,919
dash arm

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:18,320
channel but we moved away from freenode

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,000
and

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:25,919
we are now on liberator chat

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,240
also the mailing list has been updated

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,960
so

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,000
it's not opensuse arm opensuse.org

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,280
anymore

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,280
it's now arm at least dot opensuse.com

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,400
thank you for your attention

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,640
and if you have questions please reach

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,760
out

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:53,840
and enjoy the rest

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,840
of the conference

00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,160
