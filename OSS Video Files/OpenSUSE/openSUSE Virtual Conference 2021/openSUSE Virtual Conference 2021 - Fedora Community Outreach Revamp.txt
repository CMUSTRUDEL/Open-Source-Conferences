Title: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021 - Fedora Community Outreach Revamp
Publication date: 2021-06-19
Playlist: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/3467-fedora-community-outreach-revamp



The Fedora Project has been a diverse project since its advent. Fedora has been shipping Workstations, Servers, Cloud, and IoT operating systems as well as many more amazing things to engage developers, users, and innovators worldwide. In earlier years, Fedora outreach was primarily executed by a group of people referred to as Fedora Ambassadors. The Ambassador Program has had many success stories of community growth during its 15+ year history.
However, as time moved on the program began to grow, but not scale and adapt. Different bodies of governance within Fedora had different ideas of how things should be run. With no scalability, participation in the program declined. This year, we see a pandemic sweeping across the globe and all events have gone virtual. There has been no better time to revamp the Fedora Ambassadors program, as well as the entirety of Fedora’s Community Outreach teams.
The Fedora Action Impact Coordinator, Marie Nordin, created a team formulated of two co-leads, Mariana Balla and Sumantro Mukherjee, and a group of volunteers (Temporary Task Force (TTF)). This team will work to address the historical pain points, create a new vision for community outreach in 2020, and re-engage the various teams & the Fedora community.
Attendees of this talk will learn about how we got here, how we came up with a proposal for change, and how it is being executed. We welcome anyone interested in Fedora, community, and outreach. Attendees can get insights into the Fedora Ambassador overhaul, learn how to get involved, and give constructive suggestions to help the Community Outreach Revamp succeed.

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,840
have upgrade issues

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,920
so today we are going to talk a little

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,040
bit about whatever project to start with

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,400
so federer as most of you know it's a

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,040
linux operating system

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,840
known to the wider community for desktop

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,840
as desktop or servers

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,440
um as at the core of the project

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,640
we are a very global diverse set of

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,239
people

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,519
we build softwares mostly based out of

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,040
very good open source licenses and we

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,160
tend to keep it more innovative

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,440
as going by the vps we have

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,120
built a strong community

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:53,200
around supporting packaging developing

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,400
writers designers translators curators

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
and mariana is going to talk about talk

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
more about the project

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,360
fedora is a user-focused operating

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,159
system

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,560
meaning that the end user it's it's

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,720
primary focus and this is why we have

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,239
a very rapid release cycle it's not very

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,720
common to have already uh

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,480
a release height of only six months for

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,280
an operating system

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,680
so this is why there are several spins

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,159
and

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
different fedora flavors which are meant

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,560
for different purposes

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,640
for example for developers for designers

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,280
or even neurofedora which is meant for

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,360
scientific purposes

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,879
also we have other open source

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
communities that

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,640
their software is included within fedora

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
and they share their latest developments

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,879
and latest changes

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,840
in order to make their the end user's

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,120
life easier

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
also uh when it comes to the for

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,879
foundation

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
where the the operating system is built

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,400
upon

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
france features freedom and first a very

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,280
important point here

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,720
is that the operating system doesn't

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,879
come only in english

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,120
it is important that the end user can

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,200
switch a different language

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,239
and this is because we want to reach out

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,239
to more and more

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,519
users and hopefully more and more

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,560
contributors

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,080
uh also the ask forum which is a place

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,359
where end users can go

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,359
and ask for related questions uh

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,359
is in several languages and people can

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,040
ask and get responses in several

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,000
languages from other users

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,199
and contributors so i'm going to talk

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,520
about

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
the history of the fedora ambassador

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,120
program so first of all

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,120
what is the ambassador program the

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,720
ambassador program is a

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,240
15-plus year program focused on

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,199
outreach to other communities local user

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,639
groups

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,680
um technical universities

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,120
um these types of places um

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,400
to educate people about fedora and help

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
them learn to use it

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,240
and potentially even become hedorah

00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,600
contributors

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,280
so that's kind of the goal in the

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,320
mission of the ambassador program all

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,680
along

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,080
um and uh

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
what are the join sig advocates and

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,120
commerce teams so we have a lot of

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,160
teams in mindshare and

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,720
we ended up with these kind of

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
branches of community outreach because

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,160
we needed to fit some different needs

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
as the community evolved so the joint

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
sig

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,440
actually they are a very

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,199
front-facing group that focuses on

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,880
connecting new contributors to the

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,880
community helping them

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
learn about the community and

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,520
potentially finding

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,160
a good fit for contributions or

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,759
just a group of people with similar

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,520
interests

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,800
advocates are a group of folks that run

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,560
small events but they don't go quite

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,280
through all of the same things that

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,520
the ambassadors might have to learn or

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,520
be educated about

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,560
and the commodops is an internally

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
focused

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,880
team working on community operations so

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,240
originally their focus was

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,639
kind of data analysis and

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,520
looking at different ways to improve

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,960
operations

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,800
inside of fedora so

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,000
probably wondering like how did we get

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,520
to the community outreach

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,319
revamp why is this needed well over time

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,919
uh different things happened that

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,240
changed

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,120
how the ambassador program was working

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,600
it basically

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,880
didn't really grow in a sustainable way

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,160
there was some questions of

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,080
how finances were being um managed and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,160
who was going to manage them

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
and uh there were some restrictions

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,039
around that so based on the different

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,800
changes

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:56,319
that came into place um ambassadors

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,919
weren't feeling great they were not um

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:02,160
feeling as connected to the program

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,919
they still love fedora and they're still

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,479
kind of going and doing

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,120
some of that outreach on their own but

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:13,440
the ambassador program itself

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,440
kind of started dying off so

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
about a year ago a little bit over a

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,560
year ago

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,479
i wrote up a proposal based on

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,080
some research i had done a book i had

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,560
read

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,280
called switch how to change when change

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,599
is hard

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,960
about how we could take the ambassador

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,319
program from

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,919
you know kind of dwindling and um

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,520
kind of seen as a failing program

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,960
to a success so i wrote that proposal

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,800
i proposed it to the mindshare committee

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,160
and after rounds of feedback with the

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,639
community

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,440
everyone was on board and then we got

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,800
started

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,000
once our team was formed back in july

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,879
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,680
we started planning our first steps so

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,000
the very first

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,479
thing was actually to document our next

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,960
steps and what we were going to work on

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,160
uh in the upcoming months initially we

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,400
created a trailer board

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,160
hoping that we will have more people on

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
board and trying to help us from the

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,840
community

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,639
but eventually we realized that people

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,199
were not

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,599
very happy with it and we're retired but

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,000
we have a public hackendy file where we

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,280
keep notes on everything we work on

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,800
and how we do uh how we process

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,360
everything we work on once the team was

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,440
formed

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
it was the time to announce it out to

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,560
the community and this is why we had a

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
couple of calls

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,800
video calls with community members and

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,240
the fedora council

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,720
and some of these are also on youtube

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,399
from last year we shared with the

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
community everything that marie

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,959
mentioned earlier

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,920
why this team was formed and how and

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:58,160
what is the the end goal of this

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,560
initiative

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,720
the very first thing that we worked on

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,519
was the ambassadors group cleanup

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,519
this is why the team was formed and this

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,800
is the first thing that we did

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,040
what we did was that we

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,920
we tried to figure out which ambassadors

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,600
had not been

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,240
active in the past six months from

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,880
their fast account activity so the fast

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,519
account

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,839
is a global account that you have within

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,560
the fedora systems and you can log in

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,959
everywhere with that account we went

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
back

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,560
six months so we did that in november so

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,160
november and going back six months we

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,959
checked who has not been active

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,600
through their account and we reach out

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,640
to them

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,320
we let them know about the the revamp

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,920
we told them that they were going to be

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720
moved to the

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,480
emeritus group and if they wanted to

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
continue they are more than welcome to

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
continue

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,519
holding the ambassador's title uh or if

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,040
they want to come back in the future

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,399
this is more than

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,560
fine the next thing after the

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,399
ambassadors group cleanup was the

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
community outreach survey

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,760
this is one of the the things that we

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,120
did that i'm very proud of because we

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,600
we got very interesting uh results back

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,760
we created a survey where we prepared a

00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,079
list of questions we wanted to ask

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,920
community members both ambassadors and

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,440
advocates

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,279
and the results that we got some of them

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,079
were pretty surprising for example we

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,120
found out

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:33,600
that federal contributors love

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,360
self organizing and organizing events

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,320
without asking for funding

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,680
or from uh support from the fedora

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,760
mindshare committee

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,880
which is the official community where

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,000
you go

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,079
to ask funding or to make a proposal

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
so this meant that there is a lot of

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,600
federal activity out there that we were

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,399
not aware of because people don't share

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,000
it

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,240
and this is a very important insight to

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,240
work on in the future

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
the next thing was the mind 13

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,959
interviews mindshare

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,320
is a is a group of people within the

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,240
federal community

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,480
which tries to um not control but have

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
an

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,480
eye on the different fedora teams within

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,040
the community

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,399
and there is a representatives from

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,279
every community

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,079
and we prepared again a set of questions

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,720
in order to

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,519
find out what the mind chair team

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,360
members

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,839
think about the community and their

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,480
proposals and

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,399
everything the next thing was to become

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,000
a fedora objective

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,560
so fedora has objectives for each

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
release

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,079
cycle most of the times these are

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,959
objectives that

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,160
are about a certain feature for the

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,160
operating system

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,760
but this sign was different it was a

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,040
community related

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,240
objective and we hope to have

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,200
our objective done by the end of this

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,079
year

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,079
so they're gone

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
our work continues in the upcoming

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,800
months

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,320
our work in progress project i like to

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,279
call all of these things

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
sub projects within their their event uh

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,760
israel handbooks

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,440
their old handbooks is meant to be a

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,880
little bit of documentation

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,440
on what each contributor slash

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,240
community member can do within the

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,120
community

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,279
but not as a job description so if

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,959
you're part of the marketing team you do

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,079
this this and this

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,079
but what do you receive back so we we

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,959
try to create documentation from

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,839
the contributors perspective other than

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:48,480
just the list of

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:51,600
tasks you can work on if you join a team

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,639
the next thing was helping the fedora

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,279
council with some questions

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,079
an engagement survey was launched from

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,560
the

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,560
uh fedora council and it's still going

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,839
on it will be going on until the end of

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,720
this month

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
in order again to find out some a little

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
bit more

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,000
details on also the use of the

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,399
operating system and what a fedora user

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
do

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,839
with the software so far we have

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,320
presented our

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,279
revamp on death conferences

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,320
also at the federal release party we had

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,800
last month

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
and we will be speaking at the community

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
team roles

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,639
um we're making some swag for the team

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,480
to be able to hand out and also just use

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,920
on their own computers in places where

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,399
they want to look at them

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,279
um we also have this really cool thing

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,360
in fedora called

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
cheat cubes and we've had them around

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,560
for quite a while

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,560
but they haven't been updated so we're

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,560
looking to update

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880
those and kind of modernize them make

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,800
them um

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,880
really the new fedora logo and make them

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,920
uh accessible to everybody to print at

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,399
home

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,240
um so we also are working on how to join

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,720
fedora printable handouts

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,160
so that folks in the ambassador teams

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,760
and outreach teams

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,440
have these types of things that they can

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,519
just use at home uh

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
really to help empower that kind of

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,079
self-organizing

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,839
and then also team flag we hope to get

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,360
something for the folks on the different

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,600
teams to help them

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,880
feel a bit more connected coming to the

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,680
part of future

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
right so marie and mariana doctor will

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,279
talk

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,880
at length about what we have done

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,480
and now when it comes to how we are

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,000
looking to present this

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,360
as as a community give back

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,480
to the to the upstream which is we want

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,240
to make

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,759
fedoras community uh ambassadors model

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,279
as one of those

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,959
a smart modern robust uh model for

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,279
everybody to adopt it's

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,240
it's going to be more like a open

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,320
ambassadors

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,600
program model which others can also take

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,240
as a reference

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
to build their understudies program more

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,279
importantly this

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,320
particular way of doing the work

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,880
is to make sure that we sustain as we

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,120
grow

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,920
so the whole idea would be to sustain

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,399
our

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,519
current contributors as well as grow

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,399
with

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,759
our rather provide capacity to grow

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,040
through this program

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,759
in the past we have suffered a lot with

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,480
growth and we have severely suffered a

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,959
lot about

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,759
a lot of sustainability so the whole

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,399
idea

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,480
was to bring content more and more

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,680
reachable or onboarding guides more and

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,519
more reachable to

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
everybody and one of the ways we have

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,720
been trying to do that is have this role

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,519
handbooks

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,519
have been made in multiple languages or

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,600
six to eight key languages

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,720
we want to also make sure that these are

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,079
uh provided as a form of onboarding

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,400
guides to

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,520
all the members who want to join as a

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,319
part of this

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,319
group and they so that they can actually

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,839
understand the change much better than

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,799
they can perform

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,959
in cognizant of the change that we are

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,520
trying to green at the community

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,640
the whole thing that we have tried to

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,000
focus upon

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,039
with this revamp is fostering this

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,080
identities of individuals and a

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,320
long-term strategy

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,679
so one of those way that we want to

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,960
build this identity

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,120
is to make sure that we have we create

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
uh the sense that everybody needs to

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,240
work together so

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,240
marketing makes sure that design and

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
design needs

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,200
you know translations and everybody

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,320
needs to work as a single

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,480
unit to make this revamp possible

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,400
the way we are trying to make this much

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
much easier for more and more teams to

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,240
work with

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,799
because we are having surveys as we go

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
on

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,559
to build up this awareness inside the

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,960
community and

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,679
that will help us with this long-term

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,480
strategy

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,960
of involving more and more contributors

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,480
as

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,760
as the ongoing revamp as well as after

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
the revamp

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,240
is over you're going to get more and

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,000
more join us

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
moving on moving you would have some

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,720
insights about

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,640
how this whole program came towards the

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,320
stands

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,919
so yeah i want to share a couple of

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:37,200
insights or our

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,000
kind of viewpoints that are around this

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,559
revamp

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
so the number one being that we're

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,280
applying something

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,080
i call rise to this initiative rise is

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,919
something that

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:53,120
i came up with to kind of evaluate

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,760
and support the fedora community

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,720
and basically it's made up of

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,720
recognition

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:05,200
incentive support empowerment and

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,720
um really i feel like these four

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,679
traits really need to be in in place for

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,440
a community to be happy and healthy so

00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,720
as we've been doing this revamp

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,240
we've been putting um the different

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
sub projects we've been working on as

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,039
mariana said um

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,679
you know evaluating them with this rise

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,600
concept

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,039
are they providing these things to the

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,480
fedora community

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:34,320
and um can we do these things

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,799
better um we've also seen a wonderful

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,880
shift

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
in attitude from the community as we

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,440
mentioned there were

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,200
some issues and conflict with

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,720
with how things had evolved with the

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,200
ambassador program and

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
outreach in general we're a huge

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
community

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,720
and people are very passionate about

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,679
their identity as fedorans and their

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,840
identities of fedora ambassadors

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,120
so there were a lot of emotions and

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
tension that was

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,440
around this topic so when we first

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,640
started frankly we saw

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,799
some some negativity and

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,799
some folks kind of thinking that this

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,280
wasn't something we could accomplish

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,400
um as we've continued to work on it over

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,320
the last year

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:20,400
we've seen so much positivity

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,080
um people are getting excited when we

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
talk about it now people are coming to

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,960
our

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,240
sessions at the release party and asking

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,440
really

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,039
good questions and helping us um form

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,039
this and continue to

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,200
evolve the revamp and make it a success

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,240
so we're super excited to see that

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
lastly

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,480
we fedora is a huge place and we are

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,240
still trying to

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,400
raise awareness about the work that

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
we're doing and hopefully get people

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,200
excited

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,159
and ready to kind of start up when

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,679
when all the documentation and all the

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,360
resources are in place

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,760
it's going to be a great happy day so

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,039
