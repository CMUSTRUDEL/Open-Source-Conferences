for having us and uh and i'll talk a

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,079
little bit about shells

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,840
so you know just in a nutshell you know

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,280
shells is essentially you know we it's a

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,079
virtual desktop where we

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
converge all devices into the cloud and

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,360
and uh

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,520
you know one of the cool things is with

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
shells you can access it from any web

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,480
enabled device so

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,520
you know as long as you have access to a

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,199
browser or our desktop and mobile apps

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,079
you can essentially have your virtual

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,680
computer

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,680
on on any device

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,520
i'm sure some of you guys saw last month

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,920
we had announced our our partnership

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,040
with

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,240
opensouza we do offer

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
uh multiple versions of opensuse on our

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
platform

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,040
and uh you know one of the cool things

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,159
that i always like to mention about our

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,080
product is that

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,280
you know in less than five minutes you

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,080
can really have

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,520
a virtual desktop up and running which

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
is definitely

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,799
you know a thing that i like to i guess

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,240
i'll say brag

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,240
about so about our product

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
so sometimes you know i get this

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,119
question a lot it's like you know alex

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,479
why you know

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,399
what do you think about the virtual

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,720
desktop and and you know i always say

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,960
hey

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,439
you know i i really love the virtual

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,119
desktop for for a few reasons here and

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,640
as you can see here first of all

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,360
obviously the opportunity to give

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
developers a flexible option to to

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,119
really like test and deploy

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
all from one device you know that's

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,320
that's something that's definitely

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,079
feasible with shells obviously taking

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,239
advantage of cloud technology

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,520
you know the automatic backups the great

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,840
bandwidth speeds

00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,080
and then you know the ability to just

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,000
instantaneously upgrade right if you're

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
if you're at four gigs of ram you need

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,879
you need a little bit more

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,800
literally it's it's a couple of clicks

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,000
and and and your machine will be

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,440
updated so um

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
you know with with technology

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,720
advancements it's it's really helped out

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
with the virtual desktop right the

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,040
virtual desktop is nothing new

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
but you know with improved internet

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
speeds

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,599
the you know 5g mobile networks uh

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,840
browsers with html5 and javascript like

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,800
it's really become um you know the

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,599
perfect time

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,400
to to take advantage of of virtual

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,959
desktop technology

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,959
uh also you know there's there's other

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
benefits with the virtual desktop where

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,200
if you have the homes where you know

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,879
they lack a computer they lack that

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,959
desktop experience

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,040
obviously uh the virtual desktop is a

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,560
nice alternative to really convert any

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,360
of those devices

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
um to to give whether it's a student or

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,080
or just

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,680
you know other family members access to

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,640
a desktop computer it's

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
it's something that's possible and then

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,120
finally

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,720
just you know we we love how

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
you know we can make floss more

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,440
accessible to wider audiences like

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,239
and i'll touch on a little bit more but

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,480
you know we do

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,440
offer i think over 20 operating systems

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,959
right now right

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,440
and the majority of them being uh

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,000
linux with different linux distributions

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,080
so

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
you can see it on the next slide where

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,680
we had announced like i mentioned our

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,879
partnership with open souza

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,760
we've also been uh partnering with

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,680
manjaro

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,319
linux mint mx linux as well as kde

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
and then we're also working closely with

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,640
um

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,120
these other distro zorin nitrix endless

so um you know it's it's it's been a

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,879
great experience working with each of

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,360
these distros and

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,320
and being able to make sure that you

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,040
know that

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,079
whatever we put out there that that our

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,519
partners you know

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,960
they can stand behind and feel

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
comfortable with and at the end they're

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,880
the experts too so

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,000
um you know having their having them

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
behind us on this

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,680
has been been great for our journey so

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,160
you know we do own all of our own

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,240
hardware right now and we're small we're

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,960
growing but we're in six different data

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,960
centers

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,000
or six different locations our data

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,759
centers and

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,840
and and we do own all of our own

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,160
hardware uh we've we've

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
open source some of our scripts and and

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,479
we'll continue to

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,759
release more as we go along and and uh

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:56,080
like i mentioned with the servers

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,240
obviously as we grow we'll add on

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,560
there but you know it's it's been great

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
working with the community on this one

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,840
for sure as

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,960
as as we try to make a better product

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,360
and a product that

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,360
that is right for our community as well

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,840
and just to touch a little bit about the

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,280
shells technology so

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,039
you know we we use the spice protocol um

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,800
you know our network like i mentioned

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,960
before we we

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
we own the hardware it's it's it's set

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,560
up to be built for

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
as i call it like plug and play you know

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,000
so

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
as we grow you know adding servers on

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
we've we've

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,919
done a good job of being able to to to

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,120
scale

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,880
i guess quickly um

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
like i mentioned about the open source

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,960
images uh

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,479
the or open source uh image build

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,720
scripts and then

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,520
um finally one of the cool little things

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,039
is that

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,720
you know we do offer this option of uh

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,320
you know custom images where you can

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
build run and share

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,080
your own images so this is something

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,520
that we're really excited about that

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,919
we're continuing to

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,120
evolve and enhance and and definitely

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,160
something that

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,360
uh i'm looking forward to so uh

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,440
finally in terms of uh privacy standards

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,120
you know we're no different than the

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
other cloud providers like

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
like dropbox and digitalocean you know

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
we're following

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
and making sure we have uh similar

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,039
policies practices

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
and and always looking to improve

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,919
obviously because

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
this is definitely an important thing

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,000
for us to make sure that

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,520
that our users feel uh private you know

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
have the privacy as well as their

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
security so

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
so i mentioned about the virtual desktop

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,520
solution

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,440
um you know one of the things that we

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,319
really don't publicize at all but

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,199
you know shells can be used as as

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,680
running

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
your own vps so that that's another

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,800
viable option and then

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
we have this other thing in the works

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,120
where we're still working with but

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,240
um you know we do have an android os

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
option and and

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,280
we we're looking at creating basically

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,560
like a

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,400
like a virtual phone so

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
where you know you would provision like

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,039
a voice over ip

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,080
to your android os shell and literally

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,400
be able to

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,240
take and receive or make and receive

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,759
phone calls so

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,199
another interesting thing that we're

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,199
working on in the background

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,240
and lastly i just wanted to show you a

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
high-level road map

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,680
you know where we've been where we're

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,360
going that type of thing

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
so i've been talking about our

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,360
partnerships we

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,199
we've been working with a couple schools

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,199
in terms of pilots and

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,240
and really giving uh students an

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,840
opportunity because

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,240
you know with everything going on with

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,919
the coronavirus and so on right

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,319
everyone's getting their own computers

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
but

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,360
there's no doubt you have schools where

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,440
um you

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
literally i walked into a classroom and

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,520
you have uh you know 20 students with

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,479
five or six different computers

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,160
chromebooks uh hp's you know it's

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
it's kind of interesting and and

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
hopefully you know with shells we can

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,160
help

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
you know uh give everyone the same

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
environment to work from is really the

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,039
objective

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,639
there um you know windows lice windows

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,039

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,199
big thing that we just completed so yeah

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,800
it's a it's another nice option that

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,199
if you really need to use a windows

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,039
machine you're on quickly or on the side

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,400
it's it's something that you can spin up

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,240
quickly

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,919
