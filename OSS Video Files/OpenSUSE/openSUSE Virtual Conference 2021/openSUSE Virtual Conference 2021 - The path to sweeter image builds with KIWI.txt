How Datto uses KIWI to simplify building appliance images

One of the more heavily underrated openSUSE projects is the [KIWI image builder](http://osinside.github.io/kiwi). In the last few years, [Datto](https://datto.com) has started using KIWI to replace the patchwork of custom image build tools to provide a consistent toolchain for producing various appliance images.

This talk introduces the KIWI appliance image builder, outlines some of Datto's use-cases for KIWI, and how Datto uses KIWI to support those use-cases. This also includes a brief demo of building an image with KIWI.
