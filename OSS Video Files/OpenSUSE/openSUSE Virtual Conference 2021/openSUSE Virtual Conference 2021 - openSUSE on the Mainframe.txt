00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,000
hello

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,800
and welcome to my presentation about

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
open source

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,480
on the mainframe i am sarah krish many

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,599
of you

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,199
know me as the translation coordinator

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,279
in the past

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:34,640
last year i have changed to the s390x

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,239
part as i'm a maintainer and member

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,920
of the release engineering team

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,280
i will tell you something about the

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,239
future of community distributions on ibm

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,039
c because we have achieved a lot in the

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,039
last year

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,879
and our agenda

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,120
is for at first about mainframes and the

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,160
s390x architecture

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,840
was isfat then we will come

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,280
to opensuse tumbleweed for s390x

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,400
that is a little bit about the history

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,280
and what is going on when we come up to

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,880
the important topic opens with elite 153

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,080
for s390x

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,439
that is the first stable release for

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:27,200
uh see architecture

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,880
by us when we will come to containers

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,600
for s390x

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,200
what we are doing where and what uh do

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,479
we want to achieve

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:39,640
there and that is an important topic

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,320
for coming to the future of community

00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,840
distributions

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,280
our plan here and what we want to

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
achieve in the future

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,399
our mainframe is a large

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,920
high-performance computer system

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,880
some people are calling that big engines

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,079
and that is used

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,119
for mission critical applications banks

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,040
are using

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,840
such systems as examples

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,039
and thousands of the ants can run on her

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,720
one system

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,480
on the right side you can see the

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:22,160
such ibm ibm

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,239
system with the name linux1 that is a

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,239
especially a mainframe with linux

00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,239
configurations

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,760
and it comes from the ibmc

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,280
series therefore there exists

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,360
a ibm c

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,720
and the linux one which is only

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,200
the same for early log systems

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,239
such systems exist since 1964.

00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,319
and then we will come to

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:04,560
the history of the s390x

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,519
architecture s390x is for architecture

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
for ibmc

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,040
and linux1 the first ibm main

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,560
frame system was the es 9000

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:20,480
in which and that was introduced

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,480
in 1990

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,360
then ibm has changed the

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,239
name to system s 390 in the middle of

00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,840
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,040
that was the ibm 3090

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,400
system so you can see that a little bit

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,680
in the architecture name with the

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,040
system history that

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,040
was specified for the 42-bit

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,799
architecture and afterwards

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,879
they said we want to introduce the

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,080
64-bit architecture

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,120
we add the x at the end so

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,000
the 64-bit architecture for the

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
mainframe

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,840
is the s390x and that has been

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:15,840
introduced in 2000 years

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,560
is a part of the his linox

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,680
family and there exists

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,400
other especially we are operating

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,240
systems

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,600
for ibm c there are cos

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:39,120
cvse ctpf and

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:42,240
cvm cvm can be used for

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,440
linux too there's another

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,199
virtual emission system

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,320
parallel to kvm on the

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,320
sea architecture

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,360
then we come to see linux there are

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,560
multiple runnable linux distributions

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,960
for ibmc and linux1

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,919
you can see all the ram runnable linux

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,039
distributions

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,560
their enterprise distributions are suse

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,479
linux enterprise

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,840
red hat enterprise linux and ubuntu

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,960
and the communities

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:25,160
as we are doing that are

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,639
creating the linux distributions for

00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,000
s392

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,440
and where are open fedora debian

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,440
and alpine linux

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:45,360
with a ton will read

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,080
exists for s390x since 2016.

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,880
bertolt couldn't have announced that in

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,720
the past

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,639
and that is a good choice for

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,240
development on mainframes for the future

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,759
because of all the latest her packages

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,479
and that you can vet and tumbleweed is a

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,039
good choice for development

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,639
so we would recommend that for the

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,639
development in the future

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,680
after our awards i we have to say

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,440
since this year we have got our

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:24,800
first saving release opensuse 53

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,800
for s390x

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,960
okay so you can run

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,360
servers and everything else with a

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,400
stable base

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,000
and you can uh

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,520
if we have got the possibility to use

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,120
the linux one community cloud

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:52,800
with opensuse because you can change

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,080
from slash to open through the van

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,360
you need only to upgrade

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,360
your vm van

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,319
then we will come to the future with

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,720
containers

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:14,319
on ibmc you can see all

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,639
the technologies here

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:21,360
we have got potman docker

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:26,319
kubernetes our own uh

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,319
opens to the cubic symbol and rancher

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,880
most base things as docker

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,360
portman and kubernetes are running here

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,280
on

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:40,560
their ibm c systems uh

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,599
since some years and

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,080
we want to continue that

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,080
with our s390 export tool

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,039
one example is open through the cubic

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,479
for s390x what we want to achieve

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,240
oh the cubic is a container platform by

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,039
opensuse

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,039
that exists since some years

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:14,240
we have got successful builds in obs

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,199
and now our to-dos their

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,160
uh manual test deployments here in

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,680
environment

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:25,199
in mainframe environments where

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
it is working so we we need some

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,960
volunteers

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,759
who want to test that then we have to

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,760
enable

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,719
our tests in open qa for opensuse cubic

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,279
that will we will receive the automated

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,279
tests

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,080
but we will come to an important topic

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,600
now what is with container images for

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:54,000
s390x

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,200
as i base we can use opens with a cubic

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,399
so we have got opensuse as a base

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,320
and opens with cubic as

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,320
our kubernetes platform

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:14,240
there is a problem docker hub

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:18,720
does uh provide only a a limit

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,839
of container images for s390x because

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:24,320
we were not allowed to publish our

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,480
container images

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:32,080
to uh public container registries

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,519
what exists besides of that

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,120
where is a cray i o by redhead

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:43,680
ibm is working together with red hat

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,040
with openshift so we are as as some

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:51,600
container images for s390x

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,800
but that is not public

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,399
therefore we thought about

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:03,519
our solution that our users

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:06,720
can use container images for s390x

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,880
there is a possibility to use

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:16,399
the open through the container images

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,399
created by us we have got

00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,240
registry.opensource.org

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
there's a container registry by open

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
zoozle

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,360
and we provide multi-ice container

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,640
images

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,640
on this way the obs is building

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,120
continuously

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,200
a container emitters based on open

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,920
source tumbleweed

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,720
it is planned to do that for open source

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,279
leap

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,720
in in the coming year too

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,360
so we can provide opens whose time will

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,720
read

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:54,000
images and in the future opens as a

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,040
leap based images

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,839
here you can see the

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,079
github repository for our container

00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,279
images

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,640
our plan is that we work together

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,640
with our companies

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,560
and can create our own container

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,920
images so you can use all container

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,040
platforms

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,640
uh with public

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,519
container images for s390x at the end

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,880
we will work together with the other

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,200
architectures as

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:36,720
um and power people

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,120
and x 86 hey people

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
that we create multi-eye container

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,480
images

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:49,279
afterwards we want uh my plan is that

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,279
we will work together with the other uh

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,880
linux communities so we can

00:11:53,680 --> 00:12:00,160
pop so that we will have

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,360
got a future in the

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,360
ibmc world

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:11,360
let's buy our own images i can only say

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,320
take ivm in the linux one community

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,240
cloud

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:20,000
install docker docker

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,200
and adapt existing x86 container images

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,560
with opensuse replace

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,480
the base image add a

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,040
zipper commands instead of the other

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,560
things and test them

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:39,120
with the docker bit command

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:42,399
what are you what will happen then

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:46,959
you will have situations to receive

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:50,320
integral instructions replace these

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,519
comma hidden commands with

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,360
native commands and

00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,880
test it afterwards on your x86

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,680
system the your laptop and

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,399
your case wherever it is running where

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,440
to

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:11,200
and then you can commit that

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,320
afterwards that will be built all in

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,399
our obs system and that will be

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,839
published

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,839
here in our registry

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,880
what is our goal with the future of

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,880
community distributions

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,839
we want to make open source more public

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,360
so users and customers

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,639
of ibmc and linux1 systems

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,959
can use linux

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,279
and kubernetes platforms for free

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,839
they are not forced to use any special

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,839
product

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,000
now uh we we did a good start of

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,680
zeus fedora and deviant are running on

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,560
s390ex

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,560
we have got our first stable release

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,040
and we can give

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,040
our users access to open source

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,399
container images

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,040
we have to do that

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:29,199
afterwards all free kubernetes

00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:32,000
distributions can be used on the

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,000
mainframes

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:40,560
and we as a

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:45,600
linux community can give the opportunity

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:50,160
of more freedom on the mainframe

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,160
the collaboration is possible

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:57,199
well we are speaking have

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,639
uh with possible partners

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,639
but we can achieve that

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:09,199
then at the end here are the data

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:12,800
about our s390 export team

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:16,560
you can find us in our open wiki

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:20,240
under c systems we have got our

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,320
her own obs project

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:28,000
with bc systems you can speak with us

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:31,120
on our mailing list and

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,399
you can speak up with us here on

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,800
liberace

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,800
under open source systems

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,480
let's come to the q and a

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,440
