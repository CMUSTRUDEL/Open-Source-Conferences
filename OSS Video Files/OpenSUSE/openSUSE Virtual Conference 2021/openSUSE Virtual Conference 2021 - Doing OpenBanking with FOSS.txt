Openbanking in an open and fashionable way.

Openess have reached the banking. From opensource, to openhardware and now openbanking, but, does OpenBankig is OpenSource? The answer is not so much. The OpenBanking specification is open, but here are no OpenBanking Implementation.

Do we can make a OpenBaking implementation only with OpenSource? Definitivealy yes.
 
We will explain what OpenSource tools do we used to implement Openbaking and leverage it to the cloud.

We will talks about the user benefits  of OpenBanking

Then we will make an overview of the OpenProtocols used at OpenBanking, as Oauth2. 

Finally we will explain what tools do we selected to implement openbanking in an open and fashionable way.

Join us in this journey.

time

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,600
also i've been involved with the

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
financial section or sector for a very

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,760
long time

you can reach me at twitter using my

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:49,239
tagline cryptos and by the way

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,960
the name keystone has nothing to do with

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,559
cryptocurrencies

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,239
actually i started using it a very long

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,960
time ago

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,559
and it was about cryptography back in

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,720
those days

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,920
uh there was just the beginning of

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,920
open ssh one

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,200
and all that stuff and it was

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
fascinating for me

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,720
i was on what

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,720
thinking united states is

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,880
college yes college

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,799
by the way i haven't mentioned it i'm

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,200
from mexico

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:35,280
so being the newest of status

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:38,840
so let's go into what matters most for

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,880
all and let's start talking about open

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,600
banking

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,640
let's start with an introduction about

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,560
open banking

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,479
how why should i care open banking

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,680
isn't relatively old but it's

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,759
isn't not new really

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,040
open banking has been around like for

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,280
the last

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:07,360
five to seven years old years

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,479
and well open banking

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,480
is a standard note

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,400
the airpods to share financial financial

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,560
information in a standardized and

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,680
granular way

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,800
also open banking allows you

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,400
as a user what information

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,080
and to whom you can share it and

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,800
also and the most important thing

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,160
about what information is being shared

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,200
is that is

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,400
your information

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,120
you see the information that is being

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,120
shared by

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,640
open banking is about your accounts

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,959
what credit score

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,400
you might have with an institution

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,760
balance account balance personal

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,800
information

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,519
and obviously this information

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:10,800
you control who can access

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,159
but also the government could access

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:17,440
this information

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:21,200
in a more reliable and immediate way

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,080
how as a user i benefit about open

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,280
banking will

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,400
think about this you have a

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,280
a savings account in several banks

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,799
and you don't have any way to have like

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,840
a global

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,879
idea of how much money you have in each

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,159
of your accounts

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,000
well using open banking you download an

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,200
application to your cell phone

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,159
and contact your bank

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,319
with your identity and allow yourself to

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,439
see your balance

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,480
now the applications communicates

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,879
with a set of apps defined by the

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,519
open banking and extract this

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,159
information

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,680
and present them and present it to you

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,680
in a more

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,879
destructive on a more uh concise

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,080
information also this information could

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,519
be used by the

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,120
wallet to offer you tailored offerings

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,600
like

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,799
you like to go to the movie and they can

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,400
offer you some

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:28,000
ticket tickets discounts and

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,960
so on so the idea is that open banking

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
could benefit

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,600
the user because allows to have a

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,199
more to take more informal decisions

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,560
about what to do with their

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:44,400
own money and also allow other

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:49,120
technologies like artificial technology

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,120
to help you in your money management

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:57,520
but to be honest open banking

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,960
as any standard has more than one

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,919
standard

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,759
right now we have two main standards the

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,199
nigerian open banking

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,000
standard and the uk open banking

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,120
standards

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,720
they are really really very similar

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,680
and like any standard and there is uh

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,600
the bayen

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
the banking industry architecture

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,560
network who is a

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,880
an organization in germany who tries to

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
be

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,840
an iso standard for open banking

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,880
it has it tries to embrace open banking

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,919
and extend

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,440
open banking in what buyer

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,759
calls the bayern landscape actually they

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,919
are in the

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:46,080
9.1 version of the buying landscape

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,880
so we could expect in the near future

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,039
that we will we will have like

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
three or four or more open banking

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,319
industries

00:05:52,160 --> 00:06:00,080
why because this open banking

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:03,440
is a regulatory requirement

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,720
what the does this mean well this means

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,280
that banks must comply to have these

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,400
features if they don't they could get

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,520
fined

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:17,039
so they are running into implementing

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,639
open banking at a level that is accepted

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,680
by the authorities

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,520
and authorities will review and force

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,800
everyone to have this type of api

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,280
actually this levels up a little bit

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,039
the play field between fintech and

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,840
traditional open banking

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
fintech are not very well regulated

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,759
there are

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,000
a sandbox model about fintechs

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,680
when they can't exp they can make

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,240
the business case to the government and

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,440
they get a temporary utilization

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,800
but they are doing a lot of things that

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,840
are not allowed by the traditional banks

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,680
so having this open bank to be in

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,120
compliance for fintechs and

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,800
normal banks allows to level a little

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,700
bit this playfield

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,840
and push our bankings to be more like

00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,759
[Music]

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:18,639
fintech and obviously makes the fintech

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:21,840
to share information products and

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:25,599
offerings with banking using this

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:28,720
api on the technical side

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,919
well to be honest open banking is just

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,400
an epi not very nice but

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,160
it's just an epic actually it's an

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,039
arrestful app

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,039
you use operation get pause to delete

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,479
patch

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,280
to a predefined happy

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,680
the information about the app you can

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
check

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,000
in the couple of viewers that you're

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,199
looking at the screen

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,840
there is a wiki hosting adaptation and

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,160
there is

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,960
a github for open banking uk

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,400
the majority of the bankings are

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,120
implemented in the

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,560
uk standard because it's the most world

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,560
document

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,680
it has the more documentation you have

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,280
the more uh level of

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,919
acceptance and

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:25,120
you can search a lot of information

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,639
in this site but

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,680
you need to know not a little

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,240
actually you need to know a lot

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,440
about banking institutions to really

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,320
understand the apps

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,800
they are not easy to understand they

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,080
will stand like a tpp

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,680
and uh and they focus

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,200
mostly on savings and loans uh

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,839
offerings meanwhile uh

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
fintech is pushing now in shortage and a

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,560
lot of things

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:02,480
open banking itself is a little late

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,760
for that type of of apps

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,839
but you can read it

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,839
and get a grasp of the

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:17,040
of the app implementation obviously the

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,440
app implementation is oriented to

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:25,519
to banking institutions it has a

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:30,560
high level of cooperative

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:34,839
orientation it has a

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,160
data government principles it has

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,959
a lot of security principles

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,920
the bet the notifications base for open

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,640
banking is

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:50,040
out or out to specifically

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,600
in this way you can use any source of

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,680
identifications uh

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,959
you could authenticate your bank using

00:09:53,680 --> 00:10:01,360
your facebook account if you want

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:03,920
not very comfortable it's not

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,279
a suggestion but the technology allows

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,640
it

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,880
and there are a lot of things that if

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,800
you're not very familiar with the

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,640
banking industry maybe you're going to

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,120
have some difficulty

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,000
understanding them but keep reading the

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,040
specification

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,800
eventually you will get it and also

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:27,279
open banking is not only for banks

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,920
maybe you are a retail store that could

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,920
have a

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,320
uh some reputation

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,600
score based on credit score for some

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,680
type of process

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,200
you could use the open banking

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,640
information

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:48,079
uh you are a human resource sale

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,519
and you want to do a background credit

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,360
score check

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:55,839
you could use uh available sources of

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,160
information like fico and that or

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,440
maybe you could ask the user just to

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,560
share

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:07,519
your banking information or also

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,519
as a human resource instead of having

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,519
the risk of giving you

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,160
your baby in another account that is not

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,240
yours

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,079
you just share your account with the

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,120
open banking allowing your

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,079
contractor with with the account

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,480
you could obviously link this with qr

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,680
and

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:34,079
a lot of available technologies

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,959
okay so how can we implement open

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,800
banking with

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:41,360
a free and open source software well

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,880
as many of you are aware free and open

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,720
source software

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,720
many times does not goes well with

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,639
banks why because banks banner regulated

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,440
institutions they tend to select

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
service providers service providers who

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,120
can

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,920
who can sue if they have a problem

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,720
the service providers who can guarantee

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,880
them

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,920
they will comply with all the

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,079
modifications that they are facing

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,680
and when you are using free and open

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,920
source software

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,959
normally you don't have this type of

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:26,480
security but let's face it

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,120
right now many of the open source

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,880
solutions that are provided by are

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,920
sponsored by

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,959
corporate providers and we have like the

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,160
closet source and the open source

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,839
and actually that makes part of

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,800
our decision matrix what are we are

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,839
going

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,320
to see in this decision matrix matrix

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:55,920
well the the decision matrix is like

00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,160
uh three fundamental pillars of

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,320
how to choose the tools

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,720
uh to make or open source

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,519
implementations

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,399
we did it for you and we are going to

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,440
present it

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,680
from now on the decision matrix was

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,880
really simple all software selected

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:22,000
should have a corporate sponsor so

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,060
if everything goes right and the bank

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,120
wants to upgrade their

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,079
[Music]

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,240
chosen solution they can purchase some

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,279
type of corporate support

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,399
very important for cooperatives they

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,959
this make easier to create

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,959
like a

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,560
development path where we can

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:52,079
fail with the solution and it

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,000
doesn't makes so much hit because

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:59,839
in the agile world if we fail we learn

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,199
b it must be cloud native

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,399
or at least it can be containerized

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,000
why because there is a strong movement

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:11,680
from the banking to the cloud

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,680
there is like uh about the 30 percent

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,440
is planning going to the cloud it's

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,360
already on the cloud and

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:22,639
up to 60 is planning to go to the cloud

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,519
and it must be open source

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,519
why because in the end we are doing a

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,720
proof of concept

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,560
and if things go good

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,399
if things go right we can upgrade our

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,279
solution to a corporate solution by

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,560
paying uh

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,279
software subscriptions like going from

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,440
open source

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,399
to suse for example and if things

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,160
go south and the technology really

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,199
really like us

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,079
and it has a justificable buildingscape

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,360
maybe we can

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,680
sponsor that project and create

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,120
a cooperative project but obviously to

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,240
have these

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,560
capabilities we must be using open

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:13,440
source

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:16,720
so what are

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,000
so what do we need to implement an

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,760
open banking solution well

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,720
we need some type of perimeter security

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,160
we need happy management to control who

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,560
can access our appi

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
we need a middleweight associate with

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,839
this appi

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,079
who take the information and place it on

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,839
event queue and even the enterprise

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:45,519
service and event

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,519
law who is a consumed by microservices

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,360
what do we need right for the start

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,720
we need some perimetric security

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,639
kumai who yeah so

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,839
what do we need to implement open

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,880
banking with free

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,320
and open source solution

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,560
to start we need some perimeter security

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,600
the perimeter security will protect or

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,639
happy manager

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,519
and our happy middleware we will

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
orchestrate

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:22,000
our apps and our process and

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,440
we will connect to an event log or to an

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:36,639
enterprise service bus

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:39,920
where the microsoft

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,240
so what do we need well we need

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,639
a solution for parameter security but

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
so what do we need to implement open

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,480
banking

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
for a start we need some parameter

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,920
security

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,120
who protect or happy manager and happy

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,210
middleweight

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,199
that will be orchestrated by

00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:03,120
[Music]

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,640
who so what do we need to implement open

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,720
banking well we need

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
for start a perimeter security who

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,760
protects our app manager and our app

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,679
middleware this app is can be

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,600
structured in a workflow that needs to

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,160
be orchestrated

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,559
the workflow obviously will deposit of

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,280
the requests and responses in an event

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,319
log on the

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,640
queue log and the queue will be consumed

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,839
by

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,120
microservices this is

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:35,280
each of these parts

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,280
can be implemented using sponsored

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,480
open source and right now

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,440
we are going to see what are the

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,000
tools that we choose for example for

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
perimeter

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,400
security we choose engineers nginx is a

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,919
excellent balancer it has the f5

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,640
uh sponsor like corporate sponsors

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,640
we are going to use the mod security

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,880
module from spiderlabs

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:08,000
and nginxo and tools have their own

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,000
windows application

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
windows

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:20,320
engine x plus has

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,679
their own wav web application firewall

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,080
but both the page solution by

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:30,320
n by f5 and the mod security use

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,640
the lead mode security provided by the

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:36,080
always initiative so

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,640
both provide the same level of security

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
but you have like a corepoint sponsor

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:45,200
who is responsible that

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:47,360
everything works okay on the side of f5

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,120
and on the side of nginx where you are

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,960
on your own

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,160
next for the happy stuff happy manager

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:59,200
app authentication um

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,520
happy configurations we use a set of

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,240
tools from wso2

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,240
wso2 specifically we use the api manager

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,720
and the micro integrator

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,559
the happy manager allow us to control

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,000
who can access or appy

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,440
how frequently and even we can put some

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,799
pricing over

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,000
that happy and the

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:27,039
micro integrator is a tool to create

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,039
a piece is a visually tool that

00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:33,919
we can see in the image on the right

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,640
i choose specifically this solution

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,679
because

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,480
it allows to showcase

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,919
what we were doing to a higher level of

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,280
administration

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,400
directors and stuff like that

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,760
because it's the micro integrator

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,039
is a drag and drop application

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,080
and actually wso has their

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,120
own open banking opening to

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,120
implement with their own tools but i

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,000
don't like to be dependent on just one

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,600
provider

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,039
so i just take the appy manager and the

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,960
microinternational and the upper

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:16,000
middleware and implement it

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,039
now that i have uh this

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,679
tool set of apps we need to orchestrate

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,720
them

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:28,240
to orchestrate the solution

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,600
i like kamunda kamunda has

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,120
a workflow processor

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:38,960
who is based on bpml 2.0

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,919
and also has their open source and the

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,200
corporate sponsoring for the solution so

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,640
you can start doing

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:51,200
some bpml design and

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,400
workflow process and as you grow and the

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:58,400
installations grows you can switch

00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,640
to a paid support and these ways are

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:05,039
good and the solution is is is right

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,520
they have a web-based also they have a

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,640
cloud-based solutions

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,600
that we can that tertiarize uh that

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
they have a cloud-based solution that we

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,360
can maybe

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,919
leverage some sort of

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,400
of work and let them do the heavy

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,400
lifting

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,440
and for a q well for a queue i like

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,140
revit miq mostly because it's

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,080
lighting fast

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:41,679
[Music]

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:44,000
it has it's resilient

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,960
it has like two main implementations

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,039
standalone

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:52,480
or three nodes or five node clusters

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,600
and it's really easy to use it has

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,039
a web interface which can be

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,080
managed really easy and

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,200
it just works maybe

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,919
rabbit maq doesn't

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,720
comply with the requirements that i set

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,640
early because

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,240
rabit mcq doesn't have a corporate

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,280
sponsor you can

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,919
ask for corporate uh quotation for for

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,679
services from gravity medium there are

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,760
other partners but to be honest

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,799
i don't like him you why because i don't

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,320
like you i have

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,400
both post-traumatic immune disorder

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,280
so that's one of the reasons why i

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,679
choose raritan eq

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:42,159
over mu but being uh

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:45,840
open or input the

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,799
formal shrek the real protocol that we

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,720
would use we can switch this component

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,679
to whatever

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
component you like and for microservices

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,320
to be

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,400
honest microservices can be implemented

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,480
with anything that you want a python

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,520
springboard not jsphp

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:07,760
yes php php 8 is

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,880
good enough fair enough i'd rather

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,520
codes to back-end on php than on node js

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,760
that's just my opinion

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,840
but most of the work for corporate

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:23,440
banking will be done on java

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:26,640
and some parts of

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:29,919
artificial intentions will be done in

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,720
in python and also

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,360
we have a set of additional tools like

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,720
mongodb for non-structural data or for

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,760
the heaven law

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,880
we provide some process and some

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,640
visibility to

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,120
our architecture using gafana wso can

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,120
export

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:56,240
indicators to grafana grafana has loki

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,799
who provides us an appy with that we can

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,799
use to

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,120
ingest some logs and lately we have been

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,559
doing

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,440
we have been using road stack bluestack

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,440
is a cdp

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,640
is a client data processors

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,880
which allow us to have a

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,080
data entry not unnecessarily

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,039
aligned with open banking this allows

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,360
use to be a bridge

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:31,039
on the transformation from non-open

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,159
banking solutions to open banking

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,679
solutions

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,640
and we can take the drugstax library and

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,520
embed them

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,039
into the current solutions uh

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,480
applications uh

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,000
web applications java and get some data

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,480
and start routing them and

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,200
to keep things as easier to match as we

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,520
could

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,720
do ruderstek has their own

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,640
property offering and the open source

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:05,039
offering but it's a

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:09,840
nice solution but

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:13,440
beware not everything about open banking

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,320
is nice and neat

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,679
there are a few ones that we need to

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,880
talk about

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,880
like what well

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:28,480
as i said earlier open banking has

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,799
at least two recognizable standards

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,919
the uk standards and the nigerian

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,000
standards

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,960
but if you're working like me in

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,679
countries that are not neither uk or

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,039
nigeria

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,159
like me in mexico we have a

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,440
not fully defined or implemented the

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,559
standard

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,039
in the case of mexican legislation the

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,600
law only state that it should be

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,799
used by a standardized happy but they

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,960
never talk about

00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:04,880
what or which standardized happy

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,640
the market has decided upon the uk

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,159
the uk open banking version

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,960
but it's not definitely so if you are

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,559
outside

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,880
uk or nigerian markets uh open banking

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,400
will need some tropicalization

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,799
and this operation will need some

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
tropicalization and this tropicalization

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,039
will require

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:33,919
to have some togaf abilities to have a

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,240
data governance and knowledge to have

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,360
open data architecture knowledge

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:43,039
to comply with the philosophy

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,640
of the open banking solutions

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,720
and to be honest is not the easiest app

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,440
to understand

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:56,720
there are some terms like tpp a lot of

00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,080
short terms there is a strong

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,120
orientation of the open banking fpa

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,919
to manage savings

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,679
check and loan account and credit

00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,880
accounts

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,840
but open banking is being used now by

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,919
insultage

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:21,039
and security money transfer

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:24,640
companies and they need to evolve

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,640
and you need to understand

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,480
financials old terms because

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,240
there are also new terms with the

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,919
defined tech

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,320
and to be aware of the

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,360
compliance regulatory that your market

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,720
requires

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:47,120
money laundry and fraud prevention

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:50,799
and that type of stuff then

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,480
we we talk about it uh vm like

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:59,120
tries to be a super open banking

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,399
standard can be a good starting point

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:06,320
because uh bm in the

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,159
latest conception of the bayern

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:14,080
the landscape the bayern landscape 9.1

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,240
in the newest book they are offering

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,240
a roadmap migration robot an

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,279
implementation roadmap

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,360
who is really useful and

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,600
provide us with guidance of what to do

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,360
and how to do it

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:33,440
and also we need to take an account that

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,919
most of the core banking applications

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,760
like

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:41,039
like uh some banking uh

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,600
team minute 24

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,640
and the commercial bank is the core

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,480
banking application

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,039
has their own open banking offerings

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,240
because they are re-implementing

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,440
everything

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,520
and the promise of open banking for the

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,120
banking institution is to have a

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,159
coreless

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,360
solution where you can today be

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:08,480
sap tomorrow you can be oracle and

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,399
maybe in a year also you have your

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,440
own implementation and these are

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,240
like the main ones that i can't give you

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,320
about

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:23,279
open banking so thank you very much for

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,159
your attentions and maybe you have some

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,520
questions

00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,799
uh i've been around

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,760
the the talk uh all this time uh maybe

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,039
there are other

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,159
questions and feel free to ask it i will

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,240
try to

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:50,159
give my best to answer your

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:50,159
