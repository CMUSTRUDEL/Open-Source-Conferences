Shipping modules for multiple version of Python, all at once

openSUSE Tumbleweed now provides the Python interpreter and packages built for Python 3.6, 3.8 and 3.9. In this talk, I'll go through broadly how the interpreter is packaged, how module packages are built, how packagers can use the provided macros to their benefit, some sharp edges to watch out for, and what future plans we have.

Please note: I am on the East Coast of Australia, so please be aware of that when scheduling.
