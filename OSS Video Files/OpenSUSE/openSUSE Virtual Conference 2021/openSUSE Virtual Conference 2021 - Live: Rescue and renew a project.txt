How to get legacy open source projects unstuck

You depend on scores of open source applications, frameworks, and libraries. One hasn't released for years. Another is struggling with a big rewrite or a difficult maintainer.

How do you get a legacy OSS project unstuck? Especially if you don't already maintain it? I've done it and I'll share how.

I've helped get several OSS projects unstuck. I'll share success stories (one only took 15 hours of work), and I'll discuss the 5 major ways OSS projects get stuck (strategy, team, interfacing, workflow, and money) and how to address each. And yes, a contributor who's never worked on the project before can be the catalyst that revives it or gets a long-delayed release out the door.

You'll come away from this talk with steps you can take to rescue and renew OSS projects - regardless of language, framework, or platform.

everyone

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,080
my name is sumana harehereshwara

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,719
thank you so much for coming to this

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
live

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,199
talk on rescuing and renewing

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,840
an open source project and how to get

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,880
legacy

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,439
open source projects unstuck

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,359
just so you know i'll be taking comments

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
in venulis

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,280
and there might be about a half minute

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,880
delay between me saying

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,079
something and you seeing it

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,200
so first i'll show you an overview

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,000
of how we'll be going today first i'll

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,399
talk about who i

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,239
am and who i think you are then i'll

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
tell a couple of stories

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,199
then i'll talk about how projects get

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,480
stuck and how we can get them unstuck

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,120
and finally i'll ask you to join me

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,680
so first i'll talk a little bit about

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,920
who

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,119
i am and who i believe you are

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,320
i am a project manager and a

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,439
teacher a trainer and a consultant and

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,080
most of my work is with legacy

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,040
software um i've worked at the wikimedia

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
foundation

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
i worked on the python packaging

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,400
ecosystem i've worked on autoconf

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
legacy to me means that strangers depend

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,000
on it enough that you have to be

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,960
careful when changing it so

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
one question that i've had for years and

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
that i think i've been

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
begun to be able to address is how do

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,159
you get a

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,680
legacy open source software project

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,799
unstuck

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,720
a lot of times you don't start

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
by saying this is the thing i want to do

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,479
right there's a problem

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
and you seem to be the only one who sees

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,560
it a little bit

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,600
like the moment when frodo in the lord

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,840
of the rings

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,920
sees a bunch of people arguing and says

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,719
i will take the ring

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,320
though i do not know the way i think a

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:07,600
lot of us feel that way

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,959
i call it damn it driven

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,239
leadership as in ah darn it like

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,720
someone's got to do this

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,920
right and this might be you if you want

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,120
to get a project

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
unstuck maybe expedite a release or deal

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
with a team member

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,440
that everyone else is having trouble

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,080
with

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,879
um and maybe you depend on scores of

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,840
open source

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,760
applications frameworks and libraries uh

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,680
maybe one hasn't released for years or

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,480
another one might be struggling with a

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,440
big rewrite or a difficult maintainer

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,840
so in open source software when the

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,800
right experts have a chance to work with

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
legacy projects we can refresh their

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,080
digital

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,519
social and if necessary financial and

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,680
legal infrastructure

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,360
so that they can thrive through my

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,560
consulting business i've helped

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,440
gnu autocov the python package index and

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,280
other open source projects get unstuck

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,120
over the years and i'm going to share a

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,640
couple of stories of those successes

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,720
and i'll talk about the five major

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,159
places open source projects get stuck

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
strategy team interfacing workflow and

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,760
money

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,400
and how to address each so why don't i

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,000
go ahead

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,040
and move on to the stories uh

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
and the one of the most important ones i

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,680
think is

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,159
a story that's very recent which is

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,920
autoconf

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,239
so this is a story about gathering

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,280
funding and about paying people

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,080
for the first time uh and

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
i mean we have probably all been

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,959
concerned

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,640
at various times about uh what it does

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,080
to an open source project when people

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,799
start getting paid for the first time

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
does this

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,040
maybe discourage anyone who had been

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,239
volunteering

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,040
and so there you know people have been

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,480
talking about this since uh 2005.

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,840
um i would refer you to benjamin mako

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
hill's

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,439
article problems and strategies in

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
financing voluntary free software

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,680
projects

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,519
and um grants are one way that you can

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
get some money on this

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,799
and just like i'm not going to go into

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,640
the benjamin mako hill article i'm also

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
not going to talk too much about

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
how to get grants for your project

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,880
because i actually gave a separate

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,479
15-minute talk about that at the mozilla

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,240
festival mozfest and the video

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,120
transcript and slides are all

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,759
up so i've put a link to that in venulis

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,040
um

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
but corporate funding is sometimes an

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,880
option

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,160
and that is what we used with autoconf

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,440
i am going to share with you a

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,680
uh lwn piece that i wrote

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
which goes into this with in a little

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,639
bit of detail what we specifically did

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,520
in case you don't know new auto conf is

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720
a tool for

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,639
producing configure scripts for building

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
installing and packaging software on

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,800
posix systems such as linux

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
it's a core component of the new build

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,000
system

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
which is also known as auto tools when a

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,639
user installs a software package on the

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
command line by compiling it from source

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,639
they're often instructed to run dot

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,240
slash configure make make install

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
so where does that first configure

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
script comes from often it comes from

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,800
autoconf

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,880
autocov was founded in 1991

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,919
and it progressed at a pretty pretty

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,080
steady clip

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,199
uh where people were continuing to make

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,880
releases up until

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,919
mid 2012 and then although development

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
continued

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,440
uh people just didn't have time to make

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,479
releases

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,400
finally in january 2020

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,919
someone sent this email which i'm

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,520
sharing on the screen which says is

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,440
there someone we could pay

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,800
to do a new release of the auto conf

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,000
toolset

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,360
so a colleague of mine saw this

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,800
and said hey maybe we could uh

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,600
so zach weinberg and i sent

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,280
keith here an email um in february and

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,360
started talking about a first engagement

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,319
we talked about a discovery phase and we

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,120
got some money

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
to make basically what discovery faces

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
in consulting are

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,680
is let's make the giant to-do list of

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,759
what needs doing

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,960
uh so we made this giant to-do list you

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,400
can actually see

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,759
uh how long this scroll bar is uh for

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,520
all the things that really would have

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,120
needed doing in order to

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,560
properly help otto conf get on a good

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,759
footing for the future in a really

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,280
robust way

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,479
uh we were able in uh june to share that

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,560
and then in july and

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,759
august zach and i contacted some

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,600
contacts including keith

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,039
to ask for money to at least do the

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,039
first big chunk of that

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
and in august we were able to get some

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,240
money from keith and also from bloomberg

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,600
and from the free software foundation's

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,720
new tool chain

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,479
uh funding project so uh

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,039
this was a long process that took some

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,479
money

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,240
just to get started just to figure out

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,599
what needed doing but

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,440
then uh zach worked many hours

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,199
uh i worked a little bit but a lot of

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,240
this was on my my friend and colleague

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,759
zack weinberg

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,120
who did a bunch of work in

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:12,240
reviewing existing bug reports and

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,440
patches and looking to find what patches

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,639
were being carried by other

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,199
distributions and so on

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,960
and finally we were able to put out

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,080
ottokoff 2.70

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,360
by the end of last year uh it took a

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,880
really long time

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,599
uh because it turns out that there were

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
hidden bugs and regressions in the

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,720
master branch

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,240
that needed addressing and when we one

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
we've got fixed right another one

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,639
cropped up so this is a

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,479
screenshot from star trek the next

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,919
generation of an engineer scientist

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,759
hopefully saying that's true but i'm

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,400
sure it's the last real problem

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,720
um perhaps it was not so i want to share

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,120
a few lessons about what worked here

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,199
uh and what you would do differently if

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,639
you were doing this in the future

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,800
one is please look for existing

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,280
contributors and funders

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,520
look for people who are already offering

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,319
money just like keith bostick did

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,639
and look for people like zack who was

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,639
zach was already an autocomp contributor

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,560
in the process of doing this work he got

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
the privilege of being a release manager

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,080
as well gotchas this can be slow

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,039
watch out for fixed price engagements

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,840
where you say

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,400
for some number of dollars or euros we

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,800
will

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,319
do this because of course then you're on

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,639
the hook to deliver even if it turns out

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,000
to be a much bigger job

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,879
that you still have to deliver at the

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,039
same price especially if you don't

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,959
already have continuous integration

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,680
in place because finding and fixing

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,519
regressions can be a huge time suck

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,000
as zach said that preparation for the

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,000
auto conf 2.70 release took almost twice

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,480
as long as he had anticipated

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,760
he made five beta releases between july

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,320
and december 2020

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,720
and he merged 157 patches most of them

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,959
bug fixes

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,760
next let me talk a little bit about a

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,399
time when

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,080
the work that i did was really in

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,240
nudging

00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,959
prioritizing and communicating and that

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,399
is with

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,120
the command line tool pip inf which is

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,360
a tool that many people like to use to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,720
manage their application dependencies

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,959
as developers or users um and

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,399
uh since they're it's a command line

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,920
tool and i don't have a good screenshot

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,399
instead i'm just using the screenshot

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,399
from an old ustv ad that just says

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,240
exciting things are happening pip end

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
started several years ago it was being

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
released at a pretty steady clip and

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
then

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
november 2018 there was a release and

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,880
then releases

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,560
stalled in march 2020 i noticed

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,320
because i was already working in the

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,760
world of python packaging

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
that someone said hey since we haven't

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,680
had a release for

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
more than a year uh maybe we should

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,160
remove

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,360
pip-end from a certain list of

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,040
recommended

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,959
tools so i noticed this and i

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,399
went into the internet relay chat

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,880
channel where i knew

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,800
that the main maintainer the person was

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,000
putting in the most time on maintaining

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,000
pip ben's hung out and i said hey

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,560
did you notice that this is happening uh

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,399
he said yeah yeah i know i need to

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,640
make more progress faster i said what do

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,600
you need what do you need help with

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,000
and he said honestly i need someone to

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,560
come

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,079
ask me what i'm doing notice when i'm

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,240
not on track doing something that's

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,079
going to help with making the release

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,279
and then nag me so that i say okay and i

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,720
get back on track

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,640
i said really you would you would listen

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,720
to such a person and he said yeah

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,079
yeah uh at first i would argue and then

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,720
i would realize they were right and then

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,480
i would

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:41,440
uh get back on track i said okay so

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,079
over three months i donated only about

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,560
15 hours of time

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,800
it wasn't that much really just coming

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,040
into irc every once in a while

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
nudging him i did a little bit of

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,040
pre-writing and drafting

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,480
for him of here's a release checklist

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
here is an announcement to the mailing

00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
list

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,320
stuff like that helped respond to github

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,560
issues a little bit and then

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
he did a couple of beta releases and

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,800
then

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,000
impossible but true this is also from a

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,880
ustv ad

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,640
uh he made that release in may of 2020

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,839
and then pip benvez had another release

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,880
in june 2020 august 2020 november 2020

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,800
you know things are going okay

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
i was able to help get them back on a

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,120
better track

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,959
so what are some lessons here one is you

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,519
can do a lot with a little

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,440
actually i only spent 15 hours on this

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
and the link that i put into venulis

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,040
just now

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,720
gives you a little bit more detail about

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,600
what it was that i did and gives you

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
links to the

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,720
tiny bits of work product that i help

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,519
with i

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,480
th the only part of pip ends that i

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
touched as

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
uh any kind of developer was the

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,360
documentation i never touched a line

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
of pip and feature code and

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,760
if you can honestly complement what's

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
missing if you have a good relationship

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,920
with those other maintainers

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,160
that can be amazing right because if a

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,519
maintainer can be vulnerable with you

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,160
and can say hey here is

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
what i need if a person can honestly

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,000
talk about their needs that means that

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,279
you can actually

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,279
help them and you can accomplish a lot

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,760
together so those are just two

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,480
of the case studies of times when i've

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
been able to help

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,760
get open source projects unstuck

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,440
sometimes through a bit of project

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,040
management sometimes through release

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,639
management sometimes through

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,000
finance and things like that and i've

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,680
shared some other stories about other

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
ways i've gotten projects unstuck

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,839
in longer versions of this talk or other

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,320
talks that i've given so i've just put a

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,959
link

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,760
to my talks conference talks page into

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,200
venulis

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,880
and i'll also be talking about these

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,760
more at length in my forthcoming book

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,000
and i'll talk about that at the end

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
so now i'm going to move on to how

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,519
projects get

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,639
stuck and unstuck but i just want to

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,639
take a moment

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,000
and pause in case anyone has any

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
questions i could possibly answer a

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
single one

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,440
right now in the middle of the talk

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,200
instead of waiting till the end

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:07,839
and so you could leave that in the chat

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:07,839
and venueless

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,079
i see that the live stream in venulis

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
has just caught up to

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,839
where i was uh so okay i'm not seeing

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,959
any any questions right now

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,240
um so i'm gonna go ahead and move on to

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,600
talking about how projects get stuck and

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,920
unstuck i

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,920
will tell you that i think there are

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,199
five major areas where

00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:02,880
legacy projects get stuck and they

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,279
are strategy team interface workflow

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,680
and money so let me talk a little bit

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,959
about what i mean by those things

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,360
when i talk about strategy i mean

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,160
why should this project exist and based

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,160
on that

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,560
what should we be prioritizing in our

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,839
work so some ideas about how it can

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,399
become stuck

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,040
if a project started to solve one

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,360
person's

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
problem and now other people with other

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,760
motivations co-lead it

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,920
they often don't realize that they

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,440
disagree about what's important and

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,880
what's urgent

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,480
so this can lead to frustration when

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,279
people have different standards

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,600
on what features to work on how fast to

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,040
merge contributions what to deprecate

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,639
and when so the strategy problem can be

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,480
related to questions like

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,760
well what work do we need to prioritize

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,240
and how urgent is it

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,240
what is our goal should this project

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,360
exist or should we decommission it

00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:01,440
and has the team agreed on these things

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,440
so in order to work on addressing this

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,040
anybody that doesn't need to be an

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
existing team lead

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,440
can check right and assess what are the

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
project's goals

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,639
for based on what we've already said

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,040
maybe even start a conversation

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,800
in case it's confused assess the

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,160
project's health and environment and

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,560
competition

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,760
and check whether we're agreed about

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,639
what's important what we need to

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,240
prioritize

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,880
let me give you an example when i was

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,279
working on the python package index

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,519
we needed to overhaul it right and

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,560
decommission an old legacy site

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,240
and bring up to production a next

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,680
generation rewrite

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,440
which meant we had to make difficult

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,560
decisions about what was

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,000
strategically key to have at launch

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,800
right and we decided that we did not

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,199
need to be at 100 feature parity

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,920
with the old site for instance we did

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,040
not

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,320
have open id login at the moment that we

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,680
launched

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,600
because we decided that it was more

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,680
important to ship by a particular date

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,519
and be on time and on budget

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,199
than to have all these other features

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,000
that people had depended on the old site

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,560
including open id login

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,480
when i say team as an area of stuckness

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,279
the main question is who maintains this

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,120
project and what do they need

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,720
this could get stuck for instance when

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,639
one team member is so

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,320
difficult to negotiate with that they

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,000
block other people from

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,600
coming on board and implementing

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,199
important improvements

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,040
uh or conversations about important

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,959
architectural changes could drag on

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,120
because people aren't sure

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,079
what are the decision criteria and who

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
is going to make

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,839
the final decision who has that

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,880
authority so this is related to

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,079
questions like

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,199
do we have enough maintainers to do the

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,639
essential work

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,480
do we have enough up-and-coming

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,880
contributors who can replace

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,320
the existing maintainers in the future

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,720
uh does everyone know

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,560
who has what powers or are some people

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
confused about who has the power to do

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,000
certain things

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,120
do we run into team workflow problems

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
when different groups want to

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,399
participate

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,720
at different speeds is there maybe a

00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,280
difficult team member who needs handling

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,839
do we have the social processes that we

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,839
need

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,839
to support the project and each other

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,760
like whether that's regular meetings

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,959
mentorship programs a request for

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,400
comment process

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,400
so a task that again people who are not

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,439
even existing maintainers can step in

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,559
and help do

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:28,400
is work to assess and understand who

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,360
does what and resolve confusion conflict

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,160
and set up ways

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,840
to prevent future confusion and conflict

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,400
let me give you an example here

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,440
when i was at the wikimedia foundation

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,360
write media wiki

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,880
was an organic open source project it

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,400
started small when it grew

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,440
and the code review and mailing list

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,799
and live chat processes weren't

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,000
sufficient for discussing large

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,960
architectural

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,840
changes that would affect everybody

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,320
developing

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,640
on mediawiki and a lot of users as well

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,000
in order to support that so that things

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,679
didn't fall through the cracks or feel

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,320
like they just dragged on forever

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,960
we developed a request for comment

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,240
process

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,240
with a regular meeting and a

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,080
known decision procedure so people could

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,559
understand when you want to make a small

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,720
change

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,840
sure submit that as a patch you want to

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,840
make a big change

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,880
here is how to shepherd it through the

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,039
request for comment

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:27,440
process when i say interface as an area

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,160
of stuckness i mean the interface

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,160
uh between the team and all of the

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,120
people and organizations that the team

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,320
needs to

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,720
get information flow with who

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,679
are our users partners and potential

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,760
contributors

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,120
and what do they need this issue can

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,360
become stuck for instance

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,440
if a team does not consistently listen

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,400
to and communicate with

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,720
groups that it's working for and with

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,640
because then that team is likely to miss

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,080
important information make the wrong

00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,640
decisions and maybe lose usage and trust

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,200
uh so this is related to questions like

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,080
who

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,160
are our partners and upstreams do new

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,000
contributors fall through the cracks

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,440
are we listening to them are we

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,559
responding quickly enough to their

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
concerns

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,600
do they have a way of listening to us

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
and do we

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,600
talk to each other so a task that a

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,799
person can do

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,400
to help improve this area where an open

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,200
source project can get stuck

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,799
is to assess and identify the main

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,360
stakeholders and actors

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,840
and make it easier for us to listen to

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,799
and talk with them about their goals

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,120
expectations and needs so for example

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,559
again when i worked at the wikimedia

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,520
foundation

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,240
mediawiki is a web application right

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,039
that

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,360
a lot of different organizations use

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,840
wikimedia was sort of in this

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,039
dual position of both being the main

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:55,440
developer of this thing that

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,320
other people use that many many vendors

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,640
and individual

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,160
organizations cared about because it was

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,200
a wiki application

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,760
and hosting the biggest wiki right

00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,240
wikipedia and its sibling sites

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,880
however sometimes the people making

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,360
decisions

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,400
important to the future of mediawiki

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,480
wanted to hear

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,200
from all the other people who cared

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
about mediawiki as its own code base as

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,280
its own application

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,919
but it was not easy for us to hear from

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,120
them

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:28,720
so we hired an outreachy intern

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,559
to help find those third-party users

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,559
and make a big list of them and help

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,960
them coordinate help them basically

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,240
engage in some collective action and now

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,919
uh that work has grown

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,240
into i believe a sort of user counsel

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
fourth let's talk about workflow and

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,880
this is

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,039
uh in a sense a very simple question

00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,840
right are your tools set up

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,679
to support your work this cable helps

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,320
this can become stuck for instance

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,440
if contributors started this project

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,159
years ago

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,760
on an old platform that doesn't

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,480
integrate conversation

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,679
patches review and so on and if no one's

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,200
put in the effort to

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,200
integrate these things together or

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
migrate to a platform that

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,240
supports connecting all these things

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,039
together things will fall through the

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,760
cracks

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:16,240
or maybe sometimes people start multiple

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,679
different discussion venues uh

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,600
a discourse over here a getter over here

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,039
and uh you know maybe a new mailing list

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,720
over here or a discord

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,640
and it can be tiresome to duplicate

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,880
interlink engineering discussions

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
among them so this is going to be

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,240
related to

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,240
questions of tooling like do we run

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
automated tests on every patch

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,520
do new issues and patches and

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,440
discussions get interlinked so

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
developers and users can easily follow

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,320
up

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,159
are there bottlenecks or duplications in

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,799
the platforms that we use to respond

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,240
to issues review code and discuss the

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,120
project in general

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,600
so a thing that you can do to make

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,400
progress on this and reduce how stuck

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,240
a project can be on this is assess

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,120
developer contributor and maintainer

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,120
experience

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,880
and upgrade tools and platforms to

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,880
reduce toil for everyone

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,000
you remember that i mentioned that

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,720
autoconf

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
does not have continuous integration yet

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,840
and

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,440
zack actually wrote up an assessment uh

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,880
strengths weaknesses opportunities and

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
threats assessment

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,559
of how auto conf and the entire auto

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,440
tools

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,320
work and he was able to call that out

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,679
and explain

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,520
why this was a problem and get more

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,159
support for fixing that and other

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,120
workflow

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
issues and fi the last stuckness i want

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,640
to talk about is money

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,000
the main question do we have the

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,960
necessary plans and

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,240
income to make project progress because

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,559
this can become stuck if

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,559
a team is used to working all volunteer

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,440
and hasn't imagined what chunks of work

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,919
could be done

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,760
by hiring new contractors or maybe the

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,480
existing team doesn't have connections

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,919
to

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,520
open source program officers or

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,600
corporations

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,799
program officers at funding agencies and

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,960
benefactors

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,640
so questions that one would want to

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,919
address on this front

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,960
is include do we have enough money to do

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,880
what we want to do

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,080
have we developed plans or proposals to

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,799
turn money

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,080
into progress can we persuade funders to

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,640
give us money

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,760
so a person even who is not an existing

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,640
maintainer or even an existing

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,120
contributor

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,919
can assess the current budget if there

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,240
is one

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,200
and assess the current roadmap research

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,320
possible funders

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:27,200
and propose and execute funded work uh

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,799
and one way that we in the python world

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,480
are trying to work on this

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,720
is through the python software

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,960
foundation's volunteer work group

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,000
on project funding which i co-founded

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,720
and i'm a part of

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,919
uh which tries to connect together

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,159
opportunities for

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,279
funding with individual projects so that

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:46,400
people understand

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,720
that this is a doable thing so

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
these are you know some some stucknesses

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,880
as i say so

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,440
i think that uh what i've been able to

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,440
do

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,960
in order to come into a project even

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,559
when i'm not an existing maintainer or

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,200
not an existing contributor

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,919
and help make change in this way follows

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,080
this basic

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,840
sequence which is you settle in which is

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,480
to say you do routine

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,679
tasks that do not require much trust and

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,039
you assess things and you earn

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,440
credibility

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,039
then you take charge which is to say you

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,720
do things that require trust but the

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,000
group has already agreed that they need

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
to happen

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,960
then you make change you modify and add

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,400
social digital financial and legal

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,880
infrastructure

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,760
and uh you pass the baton which is to

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,559
say that you

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,120
pass leadership over to your successors

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,919
and you leave um and i go into a lot

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,440
more detail

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,960
on what one does in these steps

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
in a few other talks that i've been

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,200
giving recently and i just put a link in

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,880
venue list

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,880
but i'm also going to be talking about

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,720
them more at length in my forthcoming

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,279
book which i will talk about at the end

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,120
um and let me talk a moment about why

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,840
you kind of have to do it this way which

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,159
is

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,960
this you know imagine if you were going

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,200
to hand over

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
the keys of a project to somebody else

00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,919
right think about

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,120
what you'd be worried about if it if it

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,799
went wrong so

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:08,400
uh you really need to uh be aware of

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,640
credibility as you do this um

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,760
one thought that i have about all this

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,840
is

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,559
depending on what opinions you have

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,760
right it can be useful to just make sure

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,720
you keep your eye

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,520
on your final goal which is to make sure

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,720
this project

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,159
is humming along and being as successful

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,400
as it can be

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
by its own goals right and by your goals

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,279
so

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,880
when questions come up that are

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,799
engineering questions of architecture

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,120
code style and which platform to use

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,919
it can be useful to remember that and

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,600
focus on

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,000
saying this is blocking us so i want to

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,360
facilitate us getting this resolved

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,440
if a question comes up that has to do

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,279
with your core values of course you know

00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,919
you need to engage in that discussion

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,880
but if you can demonstrate that power

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
and

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,520
winning small fights is not your goal

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,000
you're going to do a lot better

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,200
so i'd like to ask you to join me and

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,799
then we'll have a few minutes for

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,360
questions and answers

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,120
these tools and practices i hope will

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,080
help not just lead developers and

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,240
founders

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,279
but everybody so that you know anyone

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,960
can be frodo

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,720
right and we can work on this a bit

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,919
together i have

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,720
a an upcoming book uh that i am working

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,559
on right now

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,559
i imagine it's probably going to come

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,039
out next year but i'm working on it and

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,120
there are some sample uh chapters of it

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,279
available right now and i've put a link

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,640
to that in venue list so if you

and i know some of you are in europe and

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:48,240
it is

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,120
well into the evening where you are it

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,000
