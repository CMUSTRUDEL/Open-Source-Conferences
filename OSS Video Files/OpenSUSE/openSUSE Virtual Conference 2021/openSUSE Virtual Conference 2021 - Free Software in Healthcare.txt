[Music]

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,360
welcome everybody

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,920
to opensuse conference 2021

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,759
and to my talk about the state of free

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,480
software for healthcare

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,960
as you all know health is a very special

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,680
good

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
and it needs special attendance when it

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,560
comes to

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:29,519
data protection and security

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,160
around healthcare software and this is

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,200
basically

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,399
where i want to talk about a little bit

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
about me

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,000
i'm an electrical engineer by by

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,000
education

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,559
i work as a project manager

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,680
and business consultant and help

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:49,360
companies to

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,520
optimize their supply chain

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,000
often but not always in conjunction with

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,199
sap software

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,520
i'm a happy user of free software since

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,840
the 90s

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:07,520
end of 19 1998

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:11,360
i think i converted completely to

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,840
zusa at that time i'm opensuse

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,759
contributor and on the opensuse board

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,960
since a couple of years

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,920
um additionally i work on the gnu health

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
core team

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,439
and support the open forum europe which

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,280
is a brussel based think tank

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:32,640
for policy makers in

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,640
decision and research

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,680
so what is free software

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,960
um if you take a look at your smartphone

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,280
for example

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,360
you have a hell of apps on it probably

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,360
around 100 plus

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,280
and for how many have you really paid

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
if you think quickly about it i think in

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,439
my case it's about

00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,399
five or six apps that i have paid for

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,399
and for the rest

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,680
you pay basically with

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,000
you know you pay nothing but is this now

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,720
free

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,440
software or is it gratis software in

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
many cases it is gratis software because

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,959
you pay with your data

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,000
and you have no control about it

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,879
so free of charge or gratis does

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,160
not necessarily mean that the software

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,280
is really free

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,280
as in freedom

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
so if you cannot look into it because it

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
is not

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,280
open then you have to trust

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
what the supplier tells you about a

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
software

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,160
so if you don't know anything you have

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,239
to believe everything

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,959
and some common statements about

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,280
security and data protection are

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,440
well your privacy and the protection of

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,599
your data is important for us

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,760
we treat your data in accordance with

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,280
gdpr

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,400
um yes

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,519
we have to believe this but how is the

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,680
reality let's take a look

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:16,239
at the luca app the holy luca app that

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,879
was promoted by a hip-hop singer and

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,280
suddenly said yeah this is the solution

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,440
for

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,720
our corona issues um that was originally

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,560
a closed source

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,080
program which by public pressure

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,720
was then released under open source

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,280
it pointed out quite quickly that it has

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,360
a hell

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,799
of open source license violations

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:46,400
and additionally it has some

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:50,080
severe security issues so it allows you

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,680
to for example a code injection

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,400
that would enable you to take the

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,720
ministry of health down you would be

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,760
able to see

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,120
data that was not uh

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,480
intended for you so basically the luca

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,080
app is used to check

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,519
in at a restaurant or something like

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,400
that so you could see

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
uh other people's names and and data

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,799
around it

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,040
and this has everything that we really

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,479
do not want it has for example a central

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,759
data storage

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,280
with um with

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,800
a private company a private profit

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,320
oriented company

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,840
so everything that we wanted with the

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,680
corona warning app

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,199
to what we wanted to avoid with the

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,680
corona warning app

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,120
is coming around with this luca app and

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,080
surprisingly

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,600
um when you usually need five offers if

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,040
you want to buy about 10

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,360
pencils for 20 euros

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720
some german states have just bought

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,680
these licenses

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,360
without a regular procurement process

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,199
and they've wasted about more than

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,639
20 million euros on it and

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,440
the security experts rating on this

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,960
application

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,240
is it has a lot of money for

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,000
a very low benefit and very high risks

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
so if i'm going to restaurant and

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,199
somebody asked me to use the the luca

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,199
app i just deny it

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,639
another example from the german

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,919
healthcare system is the electronic

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,560
patient record

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,400
electronic patient actor which is

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,520
publicly available since the 1st of

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,880
january of this year

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,919
and if you look at

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:45,360
the app stores from

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,840
from google or unfortunately not an

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,560
asteroid for example you don't find them

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,479
or

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,520
for for ios and apple you find around

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,479
i don't know 90 or 100 electronic health

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,360
records

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,360
one for each

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,240
insurance company and i'm really asking

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
myself

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,479
at this point public money public code

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,160
so have every health insurance

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,160
invented their own

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,479
electronic patient record that really

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,280
looks like it is

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,080
but the main issue with these electronic

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,319
health records

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,319
are the user has no ownership or you

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,120
don't have any control

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,160
over your data and the federal data

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,440
protection commissioner of the

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,720
of germany advises not to use it in its

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,039
current state

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
because everything is freely visible you

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:45,039
cannot share your

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,280
information with a certain doctor

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,880
but it's everything just visible for

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,680
everybody

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,840
an improvement about this is expected

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,800
for january 2022

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:59,520
when the the next release of this

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,639
electronic patient record comes out

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,080
um until that point in time i would

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,280
really not advise

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,720
anybody to use it uh if you think this

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,720
is worse

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,919
um no it can the worst can even be

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
improved

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,000
for example with the vivi app this is a

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,960
electronic

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
health record as well it's also closed

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,639
source

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,560
it's gratis um it has

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,880
in between probably some hundred

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,360
thousand installations more than when i

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,400
created these lights

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,919
it is promoted by more than 40 german

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,880
health insurances and right at the start

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,280
there were

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:46,160
severe data security issues detected

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,479
basically all documents that you've

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,759
shared with your doctors were public

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,720
visible

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,440
you share the the information who shared

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
what which

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,280
with which doctor your name photo

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,319
mail address date of birth assurance

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,960
numbers

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,400
from you but as well as from the doctors

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,039
were visible

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,440
the reason were that there were com

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,360
conceptual

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,800
misunderstanding in the usage of rsa

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
encryption and key management

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,000
and these could be used for example to

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,039
to read the secret keys the private keys

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,039
of your doctors as well

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,720
and if this is not enough they share a

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,000
lot of

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,440
personal data with so-called third-party

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
tracking tools

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,479
i come to the meaning of the third-party

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,880
tracking tools

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
later on but let's have a look at

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,279
another example

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,000
this is for example the other health app

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,880
same as before it's closed source and

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,440
it's gratis

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,959
it has more than 505 million

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,720
installations

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,720
it gives you a unit tracking id it has

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,399
it shares your personal data and

00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
symptoms as well with third-party

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,560
trackers

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,160
and it shares your data with the

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,399
trackers and

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,200
facebook even before you get the data

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,640
protection

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
guidelines presented and you can approve

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,440
or deny it

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,760
that means even if you say oh no i don't

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,720
want this app i i deny the use of my

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,839
data

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,240
then facebook was already informed about

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,720
it

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
they're also sharing your shell health

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
insurance data with facebook for example

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,680
i don't know why they do it but they

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,640
just do it and

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
as you know it is a us-based company us

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,800
cloud act

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,320
allows u.s officials to access the data

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,320
without informing

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:48,880
you about this so this is basically an

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,880
issue with with all cloud-based

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:57,839
beta applications so while we talk about

00:09:53,839 --> 00:10:00,880
the third-party triggers um

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,399
once your data is available once it's in

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,200
the wild

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,680
there is basically no chance to get the

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,760
data

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,920
back and these third-party trackers

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,320
are sharing your informations as well

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,680
with so-called fourth party trackers

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,160
and there was an analysis of about 24

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
health

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:23,680
up sometimes ago and scientists

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
who did this research allocated about

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,600
200 fourth

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,240
tier companies who have potentially

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,600
access

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,000
to your data so most of the data is not

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,800
really

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,279
fully anonymized and it's enriched with

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
meta

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,880
metadata so it should be possible to

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:46,800
identify with a big data analysis

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:50,079
of the data to identify individuals

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,440
by combining multiple sources well there

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,600
was a project that was

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,680
stopped later on where the national

00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,040
health service in the uk

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,360
wanted to share data with google

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,120
after this was stopped google found an

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,040
agreement with one of the largest

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:14,480
u.s based companies ascension to collect

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,600
and analyze health data of millions of

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,160
patients

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,560
so neither the patients nor the doctors

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,040
have been told about the project

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,560
and they haven't given their content to

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
google

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,079
to access their data so they probably

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,800
don't even know

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,560
that google is processing their data and

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,519
everybody knows

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,279
how well networked google is it combined

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,399
all information about you

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,440
from many different sources

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,480
and last but not least not to forget

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,760
google has recently bought fitbit fitbit

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,920
is a producer

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:53,200
of uh smart watches and health trackers

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,959
and something like that

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
so what they're doing in the end of the

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,040
day is

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,320
they take your data because you have to

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,240
have a cloud

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,639
account with fitbit to process this data

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,360
analyze these data and maybe sell those

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,279
results back to you

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,880
this is another example where you really

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:18,399
don't have any but

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:21,760
really not any control over your data

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,440
so the situation on the smartphone and

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,240
with your health applications

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,720
is quite difficult how does it look on

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,120
the

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,839
desktop so the federal data protection

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,600
officers

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,839
of the german states analyzed for

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,800
example

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,440
windows 10 and they see little options

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,079
to use

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:51,360
windows 10 in a legally compliant manner

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:54,079
so if you buy a computer nowadays

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,839
and it mostly comes pre-installed with

00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:00,480
windows

00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:03,519
you basically have no chance to avoid

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,480
an id a record an account

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,360
with microsoft they just don't let you

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,320
do it

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,240
or you need to search the internet up

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,560
front to find the tricks how to get

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,839
around it but for the average user

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
it's fairly impossible they are sharing

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
data

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,040
with their servers in the us and they do

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,360
not tell you what data

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,320
they are really sharing nor are they

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,120
seeking

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,639
your content up front so you can only

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,200
select between

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,320
a little data sharing and much data

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,680
sharing but

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
nothing about the details

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:44,720
even if you have

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,760
reduced the data

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,000
transfer to an absolute minimum and this

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,440
can

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,360
only be for those areas where it is

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,040
known in between that is transferred

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,519
there is still a reminder

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,079
of encrypted data being transferred in

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,079
the us

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,839
and um

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,320
it is not it is not told

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,279
what data this really is microsoft just

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,720
denies

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,600
the information and as long as it is not

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,800
clear

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,680
it has to be treated as an illegal data

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,040
transfer

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,720
and i'm really surprised that there is

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,600
nothing done against it

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,399
but my assumption is if they do anything

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,760
about it

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,480
then the public sector has immediately a

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,399
problem

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,480
because most of them are using

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,120
proprietary software

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,920
so if you think this is bad it's even

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,079
worse for office 365 and teams

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,800
365 for example submits between 23 and

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,920
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:53,120
000 so-called event types

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,600
to microsoft whereas windows 10

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,839
only submits about 2 000 data types

00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,839
and

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,079
it is not in detail known what this is

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,360
but nevertheless if you think you can

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,920
trust

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,360
microsoft remember microsoft is

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,560
partnering with the

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,360
nsa with the national security

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,480
agency this is the spyware network of

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,519
the us

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:28,639
and they are showing day zero exploits

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,680
to the nsa that would allow them

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:35,920
to spy on basically

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:39,199
everybody but let's come back to

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,000
to health care um for for various

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,120
reasons

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,839
healthcare is magnetizing

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,600
hackers so not only that the healthcare

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,800
is part of a critical

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,800
infrastructure every device that is

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,639
connected somehow can be

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,639
a target of attack

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:04,480
we have seen in the last years

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,839
various cases where single hospitals or

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,240
nearly the half

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,440
a healthcare system has to be shut down

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,480
due to

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,720
ransomware attacks but

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,680
if we think on a little bit more

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,079
you mostly do not know when you are

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,959
really

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,440
infected unless something happens and in

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,480
case of a geopolitical crisis

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,240
it can happen that your health care

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,240
system is shut down

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
by a remote attacker who was maybe on

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,839
your system for some time

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
already but you just didn't know

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,800
another interesting area are search

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,759
results and

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,720
large data sets for example from from

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,639
clinical

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,959
studies and here it is said

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,000
that especially hacker groups coming

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:57,199
from china

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,680
are interested in these uh data sets

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,639
and we're not just talking about here

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,240
research results on covet or

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,240
vaccination material for that

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,799
so by hiding our source code having

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,400
security by obscurity

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,919
we do not really have an option to avoid

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,520
um hacker attacks or to increase the

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,079
security

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,280
say it very frankly security by

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,720
obscurity has

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,720
never worked so far

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,240
so what is the alternative the

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,720
alternative is

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,679
digital serenity we need to have

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,880
full control over the software stack and

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:47,120
ideally about a hardware stack as well

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,520
if we want to have digital sovereignty

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,480
we have some discussion going on since

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,160
sometimes

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:58,559
about whether we should let huawei

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,380
support the 5g cell network

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,679
build up

00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,600
[Music]

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,480
many public

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,480
bodies are scared that there may be a

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:16,240
kind of skill switch

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:20,480
or um spyware software or whatever

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:22,960
within the network devices of huawei

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,679
what i mean nobody talks about for

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,480
example the largest supplier for

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,520
network infrastructure which is for

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,360
example

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:36,480
cisco cisco

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,280
has as well frequently

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,400
issues with their security in terms of

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,280
software

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:48,000
but as well there were software devices

00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:51,120
manipulated sold by a swiss company

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,600
for many many years who allowed

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,160
the secret services to spy on the

00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,160
customers of exactly this

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,120
these devices another enemy that nearly

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,760
everybody has

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,559
on his desktop is the intel management

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,360
engine

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,760
so every intel based computer has the

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,880
so-called management engine on board

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,039
which is a small processor in itself it

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,840
has a separate operating system

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,600
and it's completely undisclosed what

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:24,240
this thing is doing

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,480
so um

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
cut

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,720
the internet management engine what this

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,720
thing is doing

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,559
git fighter intel denies any information

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,200
about the management engine and keep in

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,559
mind it has access to all resources even

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,640
before the hardware

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,760
sorry before the software your operating

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,960
system boots

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:51,919
so uh it can basically do anything

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,280
as a consequence of this china has

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,559
announced to ban

00:19:53,280 --> 00:20:00,160
all foreign heart and software

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:03,039
and to only run on local

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,000
resources so local locally produced

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,440
hardware locally produced software so

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,320
that means in theory

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,880
china is doing the right thing to gain

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,840
digital

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,120
sovereignty but in fact they're doing it

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,720
for the wrong purpose

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,200
they're doing it for censorship for

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,880
control and for social scoring

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,760
and not for the sake of freedom

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,799
so let's have a look at what means free

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,480
software

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,039
and what does it mean to

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
to the user so first of all we need to

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,039
be able to run

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,480
it in a way that we wish for any purpose

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,799
about it

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,640
we need to be able to distribute this

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,679
software that we're just running

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,200
and give copies to

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,480
to our friends or whatever we need to be

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,720
able to study

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,559
how it works and to change the source

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,280
code as we need it

00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,159
and we need to be able to distribute the

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,440
software

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,440
with changes so if you compare

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,960
this with uh just the the hardware that

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,320
you're running on your desktop

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,720
or the system that you're running on

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,840
your desktop and your smartphone

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,840
um how does it match the reality okay

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,840
we're on the opensuse conference i guess

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,159
most of you rather open susie you're

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
on the safe side but i guess for the

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:25,039
smartphones

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,039
it's really still an issue

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,720
for free software in healthcare there is

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,520
a market here is an overview about a

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,880
couple of

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,039
healthcare systems um that claim to be

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,000
free software

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,799
some of them are unmet in unmaintained

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
in between

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,000
like gnu met for example some of them

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,520
are

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:54,080
for special purposes for example for

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:57,520
u.s veterans hospitals

00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:00,880
and others are for example only

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:04,159
available in some countries

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,360
for example hospital os which is some

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:12,240
has a more than 200 installations in

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:15,039
thailand for example

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,320
even if they claim in a name that they

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,400
are

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,799
an open software then that does not

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,760
always mean that this software is really

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,640
free

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,799
because it may build on top of

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
proprietary technology

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,600
so if you have a free software health

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,320
care system that runs on let's say

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,520
microsoft sql server it's not a free

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,720
system anymore

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,200
full stop some

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,480
of these so-called open systems like

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,840
open dental may

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,120
ask you for a try license to try and

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,280
start this software

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,480
forget it it's not an open software

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,720
anymore

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,360
open dental is a very bad case because

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,679
they claim oh yes we are a free software

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,360
but uh and and we have released our

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,039
source code but if you look at it the

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,000
source code that they released

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,640
is five or ten years old and has nothing

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,840
to do

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,640
with the software that they're

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:14,640
distributing and they're

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:17,679
a standard proprietary solution nowadays

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,840
and another option or another issue may

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,240
occur that the software runs free at the

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:25,039
moment but as soon as you need

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,320
an upgrade for example you're entitled

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,280
to

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,320
um to send for example the database to

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,360
the supplier

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,640
and they do the upgrade for you and

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,320
charge you for this

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
and if you have these kind of hidden

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,360
locks it's also not a free software

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,919
solution as well

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,000
if you want to read more about this take

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,159
a look at gnu.org

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,279
when free software depends on non-free

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,080
for example which

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,640
which describes very well what the

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,880
issues is if we don't have a fully free

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,600
software stack

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
so let's take a look at some free

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,279
software

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,559
application for example the krona

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,000
warning app

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:09,760
is free software it is developed by the

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,240
robert koch institute in germany um

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,840
technical development is done by by

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,480
telecom and sap

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,919
it's released under the apache license

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,600
and has some more than

00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,440
28 million installations so far

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,400
the transparent or the development

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,039
process itself is transparent and open

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,080
i mean it's it's hosted on github which

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,520
is

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:37,440
not ideal as well as github is

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,799
run by a privately owned company

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:43,360
who um keeps

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,320
for them the right to do whatever they

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,120
want

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,360
and as we had the cases already they

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,480
were discriminating users

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,480
based on their physical location so

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
the hosting on github is not really

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:01,840
ideal but

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,840
better than completely unfree hosted

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,320
the app itself has a decentral and

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,559
privacy focused data store

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,840
completely in opposite to what we've

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:17,600
seen at the luca app before

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,720
i think the producers of the corona app

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,720
did many things

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,000
right but when it was announced in the

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,120
beginning it was

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,559
a completely override overrated if not

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,679
to say a hyped

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,320
value proposition of what it can do

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,880
and in the end or after the first

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,000
release

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,640
it pointed really out that the benefit

00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,320
for the user is really limited

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:47,200
so you could see that you had some risk

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,640
uh persons around you but it doesn't

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,880
didn't tell you

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,000
uh when this happened and where this

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,919
happened

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,080
this has to do with some

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,400
technical restrictions between the

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,320
bluetooth stack on android and something

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,760
like that

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,760
but i mean they're learning and they're

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,840
picking up and in between you can add

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,080
your vaccination status to this corona

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,440
application

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,440
and i think it was the right move

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,480
and then of course we have glue health

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,520
which is

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,400
a fully free software stack

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,640
as an official new package support the

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,679
product free software foundation we have

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,600
open documentation we are

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:37,780
it is built to run on free software

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,039
like linux based systems freebsd

00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,880
[Music]

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:45,760
opensuse is actually the only

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,360
linux distribution that ships gnu health

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,159
already in the standard

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,000
it is also tested on open qa the

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,240
underlying technology is free

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:59,520
as well so open postgres sql for example

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,880
it's developed on python the

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,000
encryption is done with gnupg

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,200
we use the qt and kirigami

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,400
stack for the mobile application

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,440
and use the triton erp framework

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,720
as background gnu health itself is a

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,000
modular

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,039
it has a core module and we can install

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
many modules around it its origination

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,880
worth

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,240
in social media where it is now

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,480
beginning

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,159
to gain attention again in terms of

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,360
covet 19 pandemics

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,200
we can use glue health for contact

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,720
tracing for example that is

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,000
used for exactly this in in argentina

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,360
for example

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,360
but we can also

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,240
work on precision medicine

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,960
as we've incorporated the

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,240
genome database from the unipod project

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,320
for example

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,240
and beside this we have everything that

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,120
you need to run a hospital

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,799
like financial accounting supply chain

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,840
pharmacy module

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,840
management of of bats and

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,559
and health professionals and something

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,000
like that and we cover basically

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:18,080
all medical areas that are needed in the

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,440
latest release we've added

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:25,120
a module for dental

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:28,080
health care so you can have now

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,240
also an odontogram from your your teeth

00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,600
for example

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:36,399
mignon health the personal health record

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,159
was built in cooperation with the kde

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,750
team

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,080
and it will show up in

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:45,200
[Music]

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,799
tumbleweed very soon so

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,360
my new health keeps the data that you

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,080
want to record keeps you it keeps it

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,640
personal

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,799
it keeps it on your device it does not

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,640
share it with anybody else

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,559
unless you want to do so

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,080
we want to set up a federation server

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,440
for that where you

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,559
are free to collect connect to but

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,880
i said our main goal is to keep your

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,760
information with yourself

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,919
and make it available to you first of

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,919
all

00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,520
[Music]

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,520
let me at the end

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,320
talk about the difficulties that we're

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,640
having

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,480
when implementing free software in

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,559
healthcare

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,440
the development models of free and

00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:40,880
proprietary software

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,120
are completely different so if you have

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,080
for example the 28th edition

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,480
of a screencasting module or a

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
screenshot editor

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,720
oh you really have to think about what

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,000
can i add additionally to make my

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,480
customer pay for

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,480
the next release so in many cases this

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,559
the software is completely

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:06,480
over engineered right the development is

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,960
is quite slow you have to pay up front

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,000
the maintenance is maybe based on

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,640
license fees

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,320
so they charge you some additional 20 to

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,760
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,799
annual fees from your

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,960
original license amount uh just to get

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,279
the maintenance for the software

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,960
so this ends up in total and are in a

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,039
very high total cost of ownership

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,159
the open source development model is

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,760
quite different

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:38,240
we have really proven software

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,919
and proven software modules that are you

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,240
being used in there

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,440
as the development process itself is

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,159
collaborative

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,799
it is also fast you don't have to pay

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,279
upfront you only pay for what you need

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:52,000
if you say i host it myself i run it

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,640
myself

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,360
you i don't have additional fees if you

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,880
want to

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,320
have service for it you can

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,840
buy a subscription and you get service

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,679
for your

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,519
software this is for example where where

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,080
souza one of our

00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,039
largest sponsors makes the money mid in

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,960
the end of the day

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,120
it points out we have a lower total cost

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,640
of ownership

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,799
but the world is not all green because

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,399
we are really here knocking on the door

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,279
of big business modules

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,440
of the proprietary software vendors so

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,559
they are spreading fears uncertainties

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,880
and doubts

00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,480
so like the quality of the code is bad

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,519
there is no support

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,760
it is unsecure and so on

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:40,320
and this is complete the only

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,840
thing on this slide that is halfway

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,679
through is the last one

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,279
you're mostly not getting fired when

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,960
you're buying ibcm

00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,519
or microsoft or sap if the has the

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,399
fan

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,159
then you can say oh but if that was with

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,159
usap or something like that

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,000
if they cannot do it right how could

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,640
anybody else do it right

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,640
i mean i remember one case where a

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,480
software introduction

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,760
at a retail store uh went wrong

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,120
and they burned some 500 million euros

00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:16,799
on this failed software implementation

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,039
with sap

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,840
i think in this case this last sentence

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,120
is

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,120
not fully true as well

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,760
so another aspect on this is the way

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,000
that the software gets

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:32,799
into the company a proprietary software

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,080
is always

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,480
pushed into a company or into a hospital

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,919
while a free software needs to be pulled

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,440
in because there is simply no

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,559
no sales team right

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,720
i don't know of any free software fully

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,120
free software project that

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,559
has a sales team but if you're saying oh

00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,720
i want to have a crm

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,640
software or something like that and

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,640
you're asked the typical vendors

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,559
they come around with a sales team next

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,159
door uh next day

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,000
and they're on your doorsteps and

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,240
telling you why you have to tell

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,840
that why you have to to buy this

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,919
software

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,039
there is some lack of understanding

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,399
still in the indus

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,519
in in the market in the industry about

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:21,600
how free software is

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,600
being used and how it has to be handled

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,480
so to come to the end of my of my talk

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,840
and to summarize it up our

00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:34,080
health and our medical data requires

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,200
special observance and we really need

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,240
the highest

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,600
uh security standards as we have seen

00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,919
many of the pro proprietary

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,279
software solution do not meet these

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,080
standards

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,600
and for this reason may not be

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,120
trustworthy

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,200
so if you really want to deal with

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,320
with your health care in a sensitive

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,720
manner

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,640
make sure that you re use some free

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,519
applications for that

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,720
and we need to have the full control

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,360
over our software stack and hardware

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,159
stack

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:14,560
as the basis for security and freedom

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,679
thank you very much for your attention

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,839
in case of questions

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:21,839
feel free to ask thank you

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
