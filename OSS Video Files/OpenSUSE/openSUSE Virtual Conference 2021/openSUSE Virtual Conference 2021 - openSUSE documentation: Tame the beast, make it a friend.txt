Title: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021 - openSUSE documentation: Tame the beast, make it a friend
Publication date: 2021-06-19
Playlist: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/3504-opensuse-documentation-tame-the-beast-make-it-a-friend



Technical documentation is like the box of bandages in your bathroom cupboard: you don't know it exists unless you actually need it. And as it happens, it's when you need it the most that you find it half empty...

In this presentation we tell you everything you didn't know you wanted to know about the openSUSE documentation. You'll embark on a journey into the wild, from luxurious wikis to austere source-control platforms, where we'll try to widen your eyes on the importance of a central frame of reference, and on the numerous challenges standing in the way of discoverability and user-friendliness in the extremely rich and ever-evolving ecosystem of the openSUSE distributions. You'll be walked through the front line between users eager for technical facts and users eager for best-practices, and told about our approach, our ideas, and why you could actually have fun contributing.

This talk is proposed by Attila Pinter (adathor@prontonmail.com) and Adrien Glauser (nycticorax@opensuse.org)

and you disagree with something it's

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,680
your fault man

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,800

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,160
okay so who are we so attila lives in

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,800

devops and assist admin uh and he's also

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,960
an entrepreneur

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,760
and he works for the company uh he has

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,280
founded

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,559
and um i live in switzerland i'm always

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,520
through my phd

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,559
in it's a long story but long story

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,199
short it's about

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,760
concepts and linguistics it doesn't

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,880
really

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,799
interest us today um and i'm a python

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,920
and haskell fanboy

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,280
on the menu today uh now

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,759
and how it started uh because yeah it's

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,159
quite

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,960
it's been quite a journey uh we've

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,000
started

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,920
doing documentation for opensuse

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,079
last autumn if i'm not mistaken um

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
so yeah that's going to be the bio

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,520
moment of this talk

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
and then we will ride the tumbleweed

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,560
wave

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,320
and i will explain to you but i'm sure

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,159
you already agree um

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,479
why wikis are a trap and then we shall

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,920
if you will um discuss the

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,439
vision we have of moving the docks

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,680
under maintainership as opposed to just

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,399
doing things on wikis and on

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
these type of hit and run platforms

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
where

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,640
everyone can say everything and i will

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
explain

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,840
why it didn't solve all of our problems

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,680
and then we will talk about saving the

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,800
world nothing less

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,120
and nothing more and why documentation

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,239
is

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,040
underrated and why you and that is a

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,840
plural and

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,800
also a singular and it covers everyone

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,160
everywhere at

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,400
any time in the universe why

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,680
you should help us or at least

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,239
be motivated to help us

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,280
so a look back started late november

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,319
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,360
it started well and that doesn't mean

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,640
it it it that doesn't mean uh

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,879
now is worse but um if you look

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,879
at

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,000
our contribution graphs i mean we had a

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
lot of

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,560
different people who have helped of

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
course you can't expect

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
people to commit full-time to a new

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,040
project but

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,480
it it's quite a good a good debut i

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,560
would say

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,640
um and um the goal was to have

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,000
the nine first sections of the table of

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
contents covered by

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,640
summer 20 2021

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,400
um and we have only six

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,680
yeah we are slightly beyond schedule

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,480
i know we know why how

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,360
lazy how income incompetent can we be

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,760
and you will you will understand but

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,040
first

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:44,720
let me let me tell you about

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,840
um why we got into documentation first

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,239
the altruist reasons first

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,040
good documentation takes some weight off

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,319
the shoulders

00:03:51,040 --> 00:04:00,080
of user support and that's quite obvious

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,519
if people harass the user support for

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,120
technical questions um the user support

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,400
um are not doing any something else

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,599
so yeah you want to make sure that

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,920
most of the questions can be handled

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,840
by the docs so that people don't have to

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,160
ask for help

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,759
the second reasons is it makes sure

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
documentation makes sure

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,720
that time and energy is not spent twice

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,120
if someone solved any solves an issue

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,919
that issues should be considered solved

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,400
for everyone else

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,240
and you don't want to have people

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,320
reinvent the wheel every time

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,280
they find a solution to a problem um

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,639
and a third reason which is not often

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,600
not often

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,560
thought of is good documentation

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,199
equalizes

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,880
opportunities why because if you are not

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,639
lucky enough to talk to the most

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,240
knowledgeable

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,600
person around i think just of of people

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,039
living abroad in um

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,280
linguistic communities which are not

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,039
tightly connected to the english

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,440
speaking world

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,120
if that is your case you are worse off

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,199
everybody else who are

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,720
who is lucky enough to know someone

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
around who can help

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,120
so we want to make sure that no one is

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,800
left behind

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,199
and that that and for that documentation

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,759
is really important

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
um how did we get into documentation now

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,080
the egoistic reasons

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,520
well documenting something tests your

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,560
understanding of it

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,520
so you really dig

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,600
into details and you find unsuspected

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,759
things that you had not

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,120
thought of and that's very pleasant

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
experience

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,320
and committing to documentation is a

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,520
nice incentive

00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,560
for learning and what i mean by that is

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,600
uh on that point i can't

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,919
speak for a till a bit for myself i

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,440
almost didn't know anything and i

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,240
started writing docs

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,880
not because i knew but because i wanted

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,080
to know

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:19,199
and that's something that's

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,199
very rewarding for me

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,280
let's talk about tumbleweed because

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,240
tumbleweed i mean everyone

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,280
around the open sousay ecosystem knows

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,240
more or less than

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,919
leap is well covered just because it's

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,440
this bring up from

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,919
um sle so

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,080
you gotta expect you have some solid and

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,639
healthy documentation available

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,319
uh but tumbleweed it's it's another it's

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,280
another story

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,560
um tumblrweed by the way takes some

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,800
understanding to be taken

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,800
advantage of so what does the

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,919
documentation look like for

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,680
people interested in tumbleweed are they

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,880
going to turn to the official

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,319
leap reference manuals no

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,039
or at least not only because

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,680
the leap reference manuals do not talk

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,560
about

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
tumbleweed at all i mean it's not just

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,080
the word

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:19,280
that is not mentioned um it's just that

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,319
all the tumbleweed specific

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,520
workflow and tools are

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,880
either not talked about at all or

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,360
talked about only with leap in mind so

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,240
this falls short for people interested

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,240
in tumbleweed

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,360
because the workflow between rolling and

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,479
fixed point release

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,639
is so different uh

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,639
so what are gonna what are they gonna do

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,400
turn to opensuse wikis

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,720
perhaps the sdp no cigar

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
there is no explicit and or visible

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,319
maintainership so you can't

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,919
trust anything that's because you don't

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,840
know who's vouching

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,520
for what you're reading who is your

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,840
safeguard

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,479
and that enables me to make a broader

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,400
point

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,599
about wikis

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,199
that's the wikis are a trap

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:19,360
part i mentioned earlier so

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,000
in wikis you have an absolute absence

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
of visible maintainership so that means

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,120
that truth

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,960
is contaminated with uncertainty and let

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,080
me unpack this for you

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,440
so how you gonna tell up to date and

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,360
factually correct information from

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,640
outdated or incorrect

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,920
it's not an easy task at all

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:49,839
um you can't tell a part up to date

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,519
and factually correct from

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,000
what is not so the user has no rational

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,080
option

00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,480
but to try and pray or maybe worse

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:06,080
go to fedora or sleep with ubuntu

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,519
but no matter what um

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,519
it it just it just

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,519
doesn't do the job so

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:22,000
wikis work just like github repositories

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,200
only when you can keep your

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,839
promise partner the contract

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,880
with the user that contents are curated

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,680
and maintained

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,640
if you cannot keep your promise don't

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,200
make it

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,640
make things appear as if you were able

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,440
to keep it

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:44,800
don't fake it you can't so say you can't

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,800
all right at this point i anticipate

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,080
some objections and replies so

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,519
what about wikipedia isn't wikipedia

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,320
um reliable sometimes sure but they pay

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,440
people

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,839
uh so that doesn't count um and what

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,120
about

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,079
arc well arc what about them they use

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,640
wiki categories of as github repos

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,920
and most of the contents are written by

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,680
an extremely

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,720
thin layer of expert contributors

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,320
just like github repos so

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:21,920
we in the docs team

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,240
we use github to make explicit

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,440
this contract between maintainers and

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,839
users

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,160
that others distros live implicit and

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,600
the contract

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,240
goes as follows dear user we hereby

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,880
promise

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,839
that everything you'll find is factually

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,279
correct

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,839
or recommended for as long as we offer

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,360
it

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:49,760
so we embrace the fact that good docs

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,839
is like a wet market it's gonna be fresh

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,680
and you have people to serve you you

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,640
don't help yourself with your sticking

00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:00,320
feet with your sticky fingers

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,279
all right joke aside uh let's turn to

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,200
the types of questions we have to

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,360
address

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,000
and have to anticipate when writing the

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,000
docs for tom luid

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,680
so first you have questions about facts

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,560
uh shall i pick x or y in the installer

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,079
so should i pick

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,880
option x or option y if i want to do z

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,600
uh if i'm booting to a black screen how

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,079
to use

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:34,160
an nvidia gpu how to upload

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:37,600
my video output to nvidia

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,040
how do i get software x how do i update

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,160
or upgrade etc those are

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,120
matter of facts but also and that is

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,079
going way beyond what you could possibly

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,519
find

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:56,240
in leap documentation there are matters

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:59,440
of recommendation and these are

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,760
at the front stage of questions such as

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
how often should i update should i

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,240
update let me

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,839
emphasize this how often um how

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,959
should i solve conflicts between

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:14,480
dependencies should i use

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,839
zipper or just zipper or dnf tool x or

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,440
to y

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,800
so documenting tombow it cannot do away

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,680
with recommendations we have to not only

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,120
move away from the wikis onto something

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,320
more sustainable such

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:35,760
as such as yeah a maintainer-centric

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,680
repo such as what you can find on github

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,920
but also we have to take on board

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,000
recommendation best practices

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,040
things that you should do not just

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,240
things that

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,360
serve a certain instrumental purpose or

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,560
that just

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,160
meet certain certain um

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,440
certain facts actually so the takeaway

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,200
is

00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,839
with tumbleweed you have advanced users

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,120
not just advanced users but even if they

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,399
are not advanced users

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,920
they are interested um they are

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,040
pushing their system and they are

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,680
questioning their their defaults

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,600
and you can't meet these people meet

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,040
their aspiration just with technical

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,160
facts

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,880
um in other words

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,279
tumbleweeds appeal to people eager to

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,000
learn

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,720
and to tinker with their system so good

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
docs

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,839
are required to honor the promise that

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,800
the risks that they're taking by using

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,120
tumbleweed are worth

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,120
taking

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,639
all right so let's talk about the

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,839
obstacles we

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,839
we had to and still have to overcome

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,639
um just just imagine for a second you're

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,560
a user

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,360
and you have problems with nvidia

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,760
because guess what

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,839
people have problem with nvidia and

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:03,920
that's very surprising isn't it

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,480
so where should

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,120
where should these people turn to well

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
uh

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,560
they can turn to leap official

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,600
documentation to the wikis

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:18,079
they can go to the forums and they can

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,760
check out our friendly gecko at opensuse

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,959
guide very friendly person very

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,360
knowledgeable user but point is

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,600
you have a lot of different sources and

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,279
too many sources giving similar but

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,639
slightly different tips

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,320
published at different times

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,079
we don't want to control what third

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,839
parties say about

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,279
our beloved distribution so we have to

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,720
either work with them or

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:47,040
to compete with them so that well

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,199
we just provide the best talks so no

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,120
need for other sources

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,600
but we can't compete with them unless we

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,399
present a single source of truth

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,360
and recommendations to the users which

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,639
means

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,959
guess what removing redundancies that

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,560
means deleting or recycling

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,920
in more um pleasant words the work

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,720
of other past contributors and that's

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,160
taking us a lot of time and that's one

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,279
of the reasons why

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,519
we are lit beyond schedule

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:25,519
as far as our objectives go

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:28,160
so another reason is maintainership

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,120
sorry um meeting our own reviewing

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,240
ambitions

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,920
um is a tall order um

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,000
just to make things concrete uh

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
just check out our reviewing process

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,560
whenever we have a new submission

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
first we review the structure and the

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,320
contents of the

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,880
of the text and then the language the

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,639
style and the punctuation

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,160
absolutely boring and i mean

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,680
very enticing and compelling

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,040
activity yet that's something we can do

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,240
ourselves

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,199
we are uh the only cooks in the kitchen

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,240
everything is is goes nice and smooth

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,160
what about the

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,079
two other things we gotta do well we

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,560
gotta re make sure that

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:16,560
we have peer reviewing on the contents

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,920
so we gotta review again the structure

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,600
and the contents we're gonna review

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,839
again the language the style the

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,040
punctuation

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,040
and i mean to do these two

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,720
last steps we need to turn to

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,240
experienced and knowledgeable

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,480
contributors

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,519
and even when they are flawless for

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
technical facts

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,639
don't always agree to making

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,519
recommendations

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,160
that is in other words they are not

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,920
fully

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,040
totally convinced by the past

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,759
couple of slides have just offered to

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,279
you

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,720
so we need to accommodate this um

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,040
we need to have them we need to push

00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,000
them

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,279
so to speak uh to go a little bit beyond

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,480
the facts and

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,079
and be a little bit more embed i mean

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:10,000
less humble and less shy

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:13,439
and put some some realistic

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,079
recommendation on the table so either

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,439
that

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,160
other than i mean a little bit shy or

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,199
they don't have time to explore recent

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,079
use cases

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,760
so as to make an informed recommendation

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,480
so that's the problem we're working

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,600
we're working on the docs at a time when

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,320
there is no

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,840
not really a tradition of using such a

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,640
reviewing process because

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,679
i mean the community the the project so

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,160
to speak

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:46,640
is not used to this maintainer-centric

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,960
um model we're using here

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
and finally a third the third reason why

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,679
we're a little bit

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
beyond schedule is

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,919
the technology is more integrated than

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,440
the people

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,000
and by this i mean you have very complex

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,440
tools

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,480
such as yes zipper snapper

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,320
which um stand at the core of the

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,280
opensuse user experience

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,840
and they are very neatly integrated

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,799
nothing

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,760
nothing to say about this um but you

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,280
can't say

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
the same thing about the people that

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,160
work on that on them that means

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,640
there is a mismatch between

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,000
the level of integration of these tools

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,480
on the one hand

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,799
and the level of integration or

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,960
coordination

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,200
of the people that maintain them it's

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,640
not a criticism it's bound to happen

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,480
in a world where you need to specialize

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,760
but what would be really helpful to us

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,760
would be

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,440
to have specific time windows or

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,440
platforms where we can

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:54,559
um um yeah

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,880
go to potential reviewers and i mean

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,880
first

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,720
identify them and then go to them and

00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,200
ask them if you if they would review

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,200
stuff

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,799
there's progress there's pager two

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,360
platforms the first

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,440
one is is has been around for a couple

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,880
of times already pager is

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,400
migrating uh surely but

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,600
um yeah we're migrating to picture and

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,720
um

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,600
so that should mitigate mitigate the

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,960
problem that

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:26,240
um yeah that's not uh

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,240
that might not be sufficient

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:33,600
all right saving the world time for some

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
silver linings after all these obstacles

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,320
and these

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,600
pain um we've been through

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,160
so um first a good step in the

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,440
in the right direction um we've been

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,880
able to

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,760
assemble a telegram bot that is supposed

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,200
to

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,039
make it easier for people to access the

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,160
documentation even from

00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,320
within the context of a live

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,640
conversation

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,360
when they're asking for user support

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
so for instance you have this user here

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,880
um

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,360
i mean i could just do a pdf snapshot

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,480
lol

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,640
i have actually been meaning to

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,520
reacquaint myself with snapper

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,880
nice words by the way good english

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,480
vocabulary

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,960
um and boom

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,960
answer

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,159
snapper and you have the bots

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:38,080
sending a list of links

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,480
each of which is relevant with respect

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,520
to

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,480
snapper so it's searching

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,480
the docs with using snapper as a keyword

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,240
and

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,799
apparently the the user who asked the

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,159
question seems to be satisfied

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:58,480
um and so yeah you

00:20:54,159 --> 00:21:02,080
you you make user support a much more

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,960
lean and simple experience if you can

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,720
funnel people that have specific

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,280
questions

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,360
to specific answers available from the

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,320
docs

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,440
and another thing that's been on my mind

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,440
for

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,440
some month now as we could imagine that

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,200
we we basically

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:35,280
create new dynamics within the community

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,919
to help not only documentation but also

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,240
accessing document documentation and

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,280
reviewing documentation

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,640
so it's just just a game of

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:50,000
of of thinking here three conditions

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,120
that describe this this ideal

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,159
uh situation i have in mind

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,960
so imagine that whenever a user finds a

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,440
gappy

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:03,600
or outdated or incorrect contents

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,679
um they can report them to the

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,880
documentation team through a simple

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,880
procedure so basically uh you'd imagine

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,039
um

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:17,360
um a button on a web page

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,039
uh the web page that will be serving the

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,039
documentation

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:26,159
um and then another condition would be

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,240
whenever the docs team needs a reviewer

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,600
they can broadcast their requirements to

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,159
a waiting room

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,360
of people interested in reviewing so

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,640
people who have

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,640
made themselves available to reviewing

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,000
and these people can pick up the tasks

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,960
they're interested in the most

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
as they come so it's like a pipeline at

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,080
one end of the pipeline

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,960
uh you put um

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,600
contents that needs to be reviewed and

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
on the

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,440
on the other hand of the pipeline you

00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,640
have knowledgeable people that can

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,640
pick up the task and send back and the

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,679
third conditions would be

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,240
imagine that all contributions

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:10,159
be writing the docs or be it reviewing

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,520
it

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:14,159
is easy to trace to their authors and to

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,000
reference

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,400
from a curricular so people that help us

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,520
on github

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,400
people that review the docs now or

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:28,559
in the ideal scenario i'm painting at

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,640
both strokes

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,520
um all these contributions are traceable

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,480
imagine how powerful an incentive that

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,960
could be

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,159
to people that are just not um

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,159
i mean to people that would like um

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,279
to make use of their

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:54,400
opensuse experience um

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:57,919
on a more professional

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:01,279
um level

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:05,919
um so with these three conditions

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:09,200
met you would have um a situation where

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,440
um contributing would be

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,120
even more rewarding to to everyone

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,159
actually it would be

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,720
so the individual contributors would win

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,200
more

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,720
could because their contribution would

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,279
be more

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:28,880
uh directly actionable um

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:32,080
you would have reviewers that

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,279
would also win in the sense that

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,320
they could directly have some impact on

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,080
the quality

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,440
of the documentation about the packages

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,960
and the the software that they

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,679
themselves make

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,200
so they would have more control and they

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,320
would be able to have more

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,400
it would also act as a sort of

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,279
feedback if you will because um

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,880
i mean the type of answers you have to

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,720
the type of questions you have to answer

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,720
gives you a clue as to

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,720
what problems people have downstream

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:14,000
and also the end user would would

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,440
it would be just as easy as using a wiki

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:20,480
to report and to signal some

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:23,520
some some shortcoming so

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,559
yeah that's that's the scenario i think

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,760
is is

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:30,480
we're not quite here yet um but we are

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,520
heading in the right direction

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,279
so conclusion um

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:40,000
the documentation is a wild beast

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:42,080
but it also a very precious one it's

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,240
like a precious

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,679
navigational instrument it helps a

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,320
community know

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,039
know where it's heading and it helps it

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
remember

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,360
well where it comes from because it

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,840
embodies a particular history in a

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,480
particular tradition so it's part of our

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,919
dna

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,520
so to speak uh it it

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,960
yeah it it expresses the gene of the

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,840
community

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,400
um in a particular way so just for that

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,640
it's

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,799
it's a beautiful thing and used in

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,320
conjunction with good feedback mechanism

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,080
like the end of the year survey we're

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,880
going to talk about uh

00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,919
later today it makes for one of the most

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,760
beautiful place

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,000
you can contribute in open season

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,840
