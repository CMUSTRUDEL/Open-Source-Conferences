Installed with Libre Office, Firebird is a vastly capable RDMS.

Following on from the brief introduction at the LibreOffice Summit, I will re-introduce Firebird, the open source version of Interbase, the original embedded systems database.

Firebird is a high performance, small footprint database with a long (and interesting) history.

Firebird features Stored Procedures, Transactions, Encryption, multi user access, and is SQL-92 compliant, and can handle databases as large as _20 terabytes._

Because of its small size, efficiency multiplatorm nature, Firebird is ideally suited to IOT and edge device deployments, at any tier of system architecture.

I will go through the steps required to prepare new database for production and multi-user operations, using a simple Django deployment as an example.
