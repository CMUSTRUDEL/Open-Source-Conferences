Title: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021 - Live: Firebird: the high performance database that you didnt know
Publication date: 2021-06-20
Playlist: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021
Description: 
	https://media.ccc.de/v/3510-live-firebird-the-high-performance-database-that-you-didnt-know-was-already-on-your-system

Installed with Libre Office, Firebird is a vastly capable RDMS.

Following on from the brief introduction at the LibreOffice Summit, I will re-introduce Firebird, the open source version of Interbase, the original embedded systems database.

Firebird is a high performance, small footprint database with a long (and interesting) history.

Firebird features Stored Procedures, Transactions, Encryption, multi user access, and is SQL-92 compliant, and can handle databases as large as _20 terabytes._

Because of its small size, efficiency multiplatorm nature, Firebird is ideally suited to IOT and edge device deployments, at any tier of system architecture.

I will go through the steps required to prepare new database for production and multi-user operations, using a simple Django deployment as an example.

[Music]

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
afternoon

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,360
everyone um patrick fitzgerald is my

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,200
name

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,559
i've just finished one presentation i've

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,839
been thrown into another

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
and i guess you're all waiting to get to

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,880
the bar um

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,359
even if bar is a socially distanced uh

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,279
kitchen

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,720
or something like that i'm here to talk

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,519
about firebird which is something i

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,640
discovered

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,000
many years ago um and

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,160
it's something that i discovered

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,399
just as you do just wandering around

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,719
your local hard disk and discover it's

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,559
installed on this machine that

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,320
should be running linux and very

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,879
controlled uh environment

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,000
and what's it doing there well it turns

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,520
out

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,239
it well it says it's probably already

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,280
installed

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,199
actually i'm running tumbleweed and it's

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,960
definitely not installed

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,879
and i called doug and said i've got a

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799
problem like it's been removed from the

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,920
repo but it's still in leap

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,760
so it might have already been installed

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,520
there might be a liberal office update

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,240
removing it i'm not sure

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,840
that it's a great database and but what

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,000
can you do with it and

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:22,159
why do you care so

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,080
very briefly we're going to go into what

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,680
a database is

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,159
what's in the base which is ash's

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,600
predecessor which is not predecessor so

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,400
much as the original

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,520
source code that was open sourced um and

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,400
why is it so good

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
um and why we use it or why we did use

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,520
it

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,660
and why it's a good tool to have in a

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,040
toolbox

00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:46,640
[Music]

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,920
so i'm patrick fitzgerald as i said i've

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,520
been a programmer for

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,759
ever i've spent eight years working in

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,680
film and television

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,200
in the meantime whilst i was doing that

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,360
because there's lots of spare time if

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,920
you're working in television and film

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,280
um in australia or at least which is

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,039
where i'm from

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,640
um i did some a whole lot of programming

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,400
and a friend of mine said that i was

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,160
creative in all directions i'm not sure

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,840
what that means it was an insult or a

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,760
compliment i'm still trying to work that

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,200
out

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,120
but you've been into linux for at least

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,239
20 years now um and built an open source

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
cloud and

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,280
in 2010 uh still running in two days or

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,440
in a number of data centers in london

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,440
and zurich for large financial customers

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,760
that i'll get shot if i told you who

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,120
they were

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,680
i've been in london for a long time

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,599
but now i'm a brexit refugee and

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,160
currently residing in germany and loving

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,680
it

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,720
and i'm a survivor of many things

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,800
including a cardiac arrest two years ago

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,760
um at this very conference um

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
so enough about me what do you think

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,040
about me

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,800
are you joking so let's just go back to

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
that slide so i've just got a little bit

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,879
too

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,280
far so what's interface

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,879
now i came across it uh when i was

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,519
running a company called

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,720
oceanware digital which is a client

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,319
service company so

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,319
they're working on people's systems

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,950
and we had to write a system to track

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,840
engineer work time

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,760
[Music]

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:35,280
and at that point i knew a lot about

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,799
python sorry uh pascal and object pascal

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,200
so delphi was the

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,959
tool of choice and it came with

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,080
something called interbase

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,200
and i looked up i read up about it and

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
it seemed to be

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,879
well that's um it's it's got a long

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,840
history it's

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,599
it's solid it's dependable it's got all

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,720
the things you want in an enterprise

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,280
database

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,480
but it's got a three meg binary and the

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,480
download is 8 meg um it's

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
almost true too good to be true it's

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,920
also it's

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,040
true multi architecture it runs on

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,120
everything including

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,519
android um and of course

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
the big thing was it was free with

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
delphi enterprise

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,120
so that's what we went for um

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,880
it's got a surprising history um

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
it wasn't one of the early embedded

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,199
databases uh

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,800
and the theory is or the the rumor is

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,040
that it was originally developed for

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
targeting systems of the m1 tank

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,199
um whether or not that's true but one of

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,199
the things that they had to

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,479
assure the the department of defense

00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,080
of is that regardless of what happened

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,840
if the system went down it'll come

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,120
straight back up with no

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,479
with no corruption um

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,759
and based on that initial requirement is

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,040
kind of where a whole lot of the

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,000
different

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
design decisions were made um and so

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,400
forth and said and

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,000
therefore it's highly reliable um uh

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,240
it's compact as well since

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,960
the database sits in a in a single file

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,240
and it's accessed by a connection string

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,639
which you'll see which you'll see

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,639
shortly

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,960
the high reliability is interesting

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,240
because it it meant that

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,000
i mean it's not that we certainly

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
weren't building systems for the n1 tank

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
or any tank for that matter

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,199
um but we were doing early experiments

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,720
with um

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,440
iscsi and other network things and

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
nfs and sharing stuff and doing all

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,320
sorts of

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,080
interesting things especially started

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,880
building the the

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,199
uh the cloud environment and we found

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
that

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,000
if there was some sort of interrupt

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,280
interruption to the network flow

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,440
for example for the virtual machine

00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,000
that's been shared across an nfs

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,120
share um things like my sequel

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,360
my sequels are pretty bad

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,360
it could not it would have to do a

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,680
massive recovery on it

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,960
on the same infrastructure same system

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
running on a windows

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,440
system um with

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,639
with firebase uh so with firebird um as

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,600
the

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,160
as the the database system we never and

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,520
still

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
never have touchwood had a corruption of

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,800
the database

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
um and it was being used very very

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,240
actively

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:37,440
um for our system

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,440
um so what's firebird well

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,039
there's what they call the year 2000

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,000
incident which was

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,960
um they're going to take they're

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,120
planning to take it

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,479
public and they're going to open source

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,680
the

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,160
the code and it was all

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,199
you know linux was just coming on on

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
stream and

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,440
becoming more and more popular um lots

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,080
of internet pack

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,759
companies were being funded and and then

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,400
suddenly

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
it the bubble burst and a whole lot of

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,039
companies lost a lot of money

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479
and of course year 2000 uh was happening

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,880
right then which was

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,840
something that a lot of a lot of money

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,080
had been poured into

00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,639
[Music]

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,120
into companies to make sure that the u

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,360
that

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,919
come the year 2000 um their systems

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,759
would not for example end up resetting

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,880
back to zero because they've got a two

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,039
digit date

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,000
field um for when it comes to the year

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,840
so

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,520
um and that was a massive problem and

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,400
what's funny is when people talk about

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,800
it there's lots of

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,080
people who don't know that that was a

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,360
big issue and it was um

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,080
so they were so the they come in

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
imprisoned

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,160
company um which is owned by borland i

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,319
think and they

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,080
they're gonna they're gonna take it

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,960
public um

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,240
and they they briefly open sourced it

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
before

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
all this stuff in the year 2000 happened

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,759
uh

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,000
which meant that they just realized it

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,160
wasn't a good time to open sort of to um

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,520
to go public so they pulled the the

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,759
floating of the business

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,919
and they realized that open source code

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,039
was out there already on the internet

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,479
so they closed it they closed it off but

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,639
someone had already grabbed it with the

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,160
look with the open source license

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,319
and they started building firebird

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,400
from the original source and a lot of

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,479
the original developers i think from

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,839
from interbase enterprises that is the

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,120
corporation um

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,560
that built it uh they they joined and

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,280
they're still part of the

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,800
the the team that's making it um

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,600
[Music]

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:51,200
so so what is it good at

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,720
um anything that doesn't

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,000
need this memory restricted anything

00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,000
any system that you need to have a

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,160
maintenance free database or data store

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,920
um so that could be data system data

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
collection systems running in like

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
raspberry pi's or smaller

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,200
smaller devices um

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
[Music]

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,360
that are unattended and sitting in

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
someone's roof or

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,160
something like that just getting getting

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,440
information and pumping up to the

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,560
internet

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,760
um multi-user systems

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,040
um that just

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,880
postgres or my sequel or msql

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:38,160
is complete overkill multi-user

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,880
systems systems is not really where sql

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,519
light shines a lot of people i'm sure

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,720
that i'm

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,240
making a lot of people uh very irritated

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,120
by saying that but it's not

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,000
really it when you write when it writes

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
to the database

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
file your block does a block so you

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,399
can't actually have multiple

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,279
records been written at the same time by

00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,760
different servers

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,000
by different servers or processors um

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,760
[Music]

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,360
and because of the way it invites the

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,959
file um

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,959
if you're in a situation where you've

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,480
got unpredictable power or unfit

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,959
unpredictable uh cert um

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,079
you know system or something like that

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,240
it's

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,120
like i said you know we've had we've

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
we've worked

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,720
we've used this system for almost 20

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,760
years

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
within various uh infrastructural

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
environments with

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,839
various problems and we've never had a

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,480
corruption

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,160
um very good for something like a kiosk

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,160
which is probably better

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,920
better suited by a sequel for sequel

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,959
light but it also means

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,399
if you're doing something in in in

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,800
firebird

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,320
you can scale you can scale it you can

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,800
have multiple connections

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,320
multiple client systems talking to the

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,839
same database

00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,079
um and therefore establish the social

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,760
so-called single source of the truth

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,480
um so

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,600
that so when so that's that's you know

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,120
that's a big thing for

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,200
for us um not having multiple uh

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,720
multiple databases saying multiple

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,760
multiple different things about

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
customers or

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,959
or their systems or is it

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,360
we put it all in one database and that

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,279
and everything links into that

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,440
um and of course an embedded and engaged

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,519
devices size does matter

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,279
and unfortunately i can't scale this

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
slide properly but it's not because of

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,079
my lack of ability

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,040
but it's because the difference is size

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,959
between

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:47,120
between sql light firebird and my sequel

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:50,320
or maria um db is so

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
dramatic that it's it

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
you know it's unbelievable i i was

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,560
actually completely surprised when i was

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,279
doing the preparation for this slide

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,079
because i didn't realize a fire mode was

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,639
still that small

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,639
and that b my sequel wasn't that large

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,279
and i would do a bit a brief

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:13,040
demonstration on django and even the

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,920
down the rpm for django

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,920
is about 10 made

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,480
so if you're doing something and

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,519
building something that will talk

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:27,040
to to uh you know

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,040
lightweight systems um when you client

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,240
the client access system if it's uh

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,800
something like django you're talking

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,079
about 10 make download and the database

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,839
is going to be uh a lot

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,839
a lot more than that um

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,560
80 times larger which is kind of silly

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,399
um and the thing is about code

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,480
the more lines of code there are there's

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,720
a greater opportunity for failure

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,760
or create greater opportunity for for

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,200
errors

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,279
and one of the best things about

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
firebird is it's so

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,880
i mean it's version 4 has just been

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
released

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,160
and they keep on gradually introducing

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,959
different features

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,920
but the code is rock solid and you're

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,480
not going to have

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,760
some sort of failure because of someone

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
you know has just introduced

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,120
something to the to the code

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,240
[Music]

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,040
so our use case was um

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,639
and still is job tracking system that it

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
was originally started with the previous

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,120
company which was called oceanware

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,440
digital

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,519
um as i said designed around 1998

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
and delphine interface were used we did

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,079
two clients

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,680
and one of them was a web-based uh

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:45,920
system for for the client and for the

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,600
engineers to use and when they're on

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,839
client sites because of course back

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:55,440
then being being showing my age but

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,720
back then it was it was all the rage for

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,079
companies to start

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,279
installing the internet

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,920
and getting access and giving giving

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,240
people

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,240
the ability to browse the very few

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,600
websites that are available

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,600
um but even then it was booming um

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,040
so and the basis of that was we would

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,480
have

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,720
uh engineers would be on online anyway

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,519
so we did we decided instead of making

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,920
it a

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,760
a a thick client or a fat client that

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
would be installed on machines on each

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,839
client site we just thought it would

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,160
make it a web

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,680
web page and that's what we did and

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,040
there's one other

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,959
client there was a couple of other

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,959
clients and developed as well

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
but one of the most important one was a

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,920
desktop windows

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:51,279
client written in delphi as well

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,440
that injected would take all the

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,880
all the invite invoices and all the time

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,079
that's tracked with word

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,920
tracking time on a much like a

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,120
legal company does so you you start

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
talking to your lawyer he's going to

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,320
click

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,360
click a button or or before start a

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,199
stopwatch

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,800
you'll take the time and charge it but

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,240
in six minute increments we thought that

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,720
was a good idea

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,360
um customers didn't necessarily but

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,399
there you go

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,720
um and

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,240
so we don't get in injected into the

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,839
system via the web page

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,199
and then we do all sorts of uh things

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,000
operations on that data depending on on

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,600
how many um what the what client that

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,240
what client had what custom

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
what the contract and what the discount

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,800
level was

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,399
it all gets sorted out at the end of

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,090
every work job they were

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,759
requested

00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,000
[Music]

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,040
and you know to come up to the end of

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,920
the end of the month and

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,279
come up with an accurate an accurate

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,360
invoice

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,320
but we kept on adding more and more

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,800
stuff to it

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,880
um but it became unmanageable

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,720
um that's kind of just they're just the

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,839
database the data

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,839
segments of the of the code there's not

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,240
there's nothing there are no modules and

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,360
no models on on that that

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,800
refer to actual procedural

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,880
work they're just the database queries

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,320
calling different different functions

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,320
inside the database and it's just

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,720
it became impossible to manage um

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,759
and it just got too complex and that's

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,040
just a small

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:31,150
segment of the um of the

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,040
schema of the database

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:35,680
[Music]

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,279
and we just had to come up with

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,800
something that was more manageable than

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:43,759
that single customer

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,759
uh the single uh cgi program

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,079
um because uh and also the cgi program

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,639
is getting a bit

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,199
getting a bit dated and we're moving to

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,320
linux

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,399
and we wanted to have all the

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,839
flexibility in linux on the web server

00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:01,600
and get away from iis um

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,920
so you know but the questions that we

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,760
sort of really had to ask is do we have

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,000
the the time and budget

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,760
to build a whole new database and

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,240
because the answer to that is no

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,160
uh as well as the migrating the data

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,280
and all the other things that go because

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,799
database is not

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,720
just about data um

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,240
i think i might be still coming up to

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,839
that slide actually

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,600
um you know what do we have

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,039
can we migrate all that stuff of course

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,120
we can but really

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,720
it's time can we can we do it and can we

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,679
do it without interrupting the monthly

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,280
accounting

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,720
and billing process and of course you

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
know probably not and you want to take

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,600
the risk as a small business

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,960
um and i certainly didn't because i was

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:50,559
becoming the ceo of that of the viola

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,799
um so we figured there might be a way

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,400
instead of migrating everything to a

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,400
different database

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,600
maybe we can use the existing database

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
and

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,919
do a different front end on it so we

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,520
came up with

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,200
something called well we didn't come up

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,000
with it a lot of other talented people

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,679
came up with django which is a

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,320
a python based um web framework which

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
i'm sure a lot of people have heard of a

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,400
lot of people may not have heard of

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,250
something called

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,720
inspect db um

00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,200
[Music]

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,000
and we'll show you shortly what what

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:29,120
happens

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,080
with when you run that and

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,080
yeah so that's the

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,360
so that's the uh yeah so we had this is

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,000
the new version which we

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,160
renamed waves wave suite in honor of the

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,760
previous company oceanway digital

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,760
um and we built on

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:52,320
django we retained the firebird

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,840
database back end um we didn't really

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,080
make very many changes

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,760
um active we eventually built an active

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,640
directory authentication so then we

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,600
didn't have to

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,960
deal with multiple usernames in multiple

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,320
systems

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,960
um and

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,760
that was that was that was a real bonus

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,679
um

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,520
and then we were able to link it because

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,360
of the excel the flexibility of

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,679
all the python um applications and and

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,120
libraries that are available we started

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,520
linking into different things like pbx

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,559
and java and building presence in so

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,559
in the web page

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,960
you see here you actually can't see the

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,039
presence stuff but down the uh

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,039
left hand side you'll see team status

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,440
and and

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,480
you know all sorts of things we're using

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,530
um

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
ibm director is a monitoring tool um

00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:49,440
[Music]

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,440
so we did this with just and it opened

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,520
up our ability to do it the other thing

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,440
once again is it retained the single

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,559
source of truth which is very important

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,080
in in data management

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:05,200
so that and then

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,919
how do you use it well

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,000
as i said earlier the problem with doing

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,120
this presentation was that i was halfway

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,720
through preparing it

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,080
um and i realized that my local system

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,559
doesn't have it anymore

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,960
because i'd switched to to tumbleweed

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,679
from leap and i'm not sure what's going

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,840
on

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,039
i think i think firebird might need some

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,039
help to package

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:32,000
um package their binaries into

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,799
into into tumbleweed um so anyone wants

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,080
to stick their

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,720
hand up and do that that would be

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,720
fantastic

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:44,799
so if what we can do is we'll

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:48,240
show you how we take

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:50,480
the default database that is called

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,600
employees this is a demo database and

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,039
turn it into a web

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,760
a web webified system using django

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,960
uh which of course you know it then

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,960
approves

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,360
how how this works and hopefully

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,559
fingers crossed it's a live demo we'll

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,880
uh we'll see something

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,880
that we'll

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,360
see shortly

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:21,280
right so

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,280
let's see what

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,760
let's kill that

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,559
so i just have to get all the other

00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,600
[Music]

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,600
systems out of the way

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:47,919
um there's all sorts of uh

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,159
okay here we go

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,280
so there's all sorts of systems that you

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,720
can you can use

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:58,000
to to interrogate um

00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:02,080
a a firebird database

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,760
um and one of them is

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,120
is the wave suite system itself when

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,440
we're using uh flame

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,240
robin which is one of the things there's

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
a this is a

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:15,200
open source stuff open source system um

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,440
there's also having

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,660
problems with connecting um

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,660
[Music]

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,559
let's try something else um there's

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:33,919
there's um there are commercial packages

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:36,799
um there's loads and loads of

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,840
third-party customer customer-based

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,240
things and

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,080
admin based tools let's see if this

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,039
works

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,000
no okay i can't show you that but we can

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:49,050
show you

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,480
the original enterprise

00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:53,919
[Music]

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,480
sample database i'm not sure if i can

00:22:53,919 --> 00:23:00,159
make that larger

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,159
make it larger and make it useful

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:06,960
um so this is there was a missing slide

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,320
which is like what a database is

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,360
um and what what a database is this

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,280
that a lot of people don't see and don't

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,360
realize because there's lots of

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,480
complexity that's hidden by

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,960
the the fantastic front front ends that

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,880
you get

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,320
but you can do things like you can

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,640
define extent

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,679
exceptions so you can say if something

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,880
is done then run this code whatever it

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,360
is

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:40,960
and can we um

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,159
just replace that um functions you can

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,080
have functions in there

00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,679
you can have generators which are

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,320
basically things that generate

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:53,520
a unique id um

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,600
for example um procedures

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,120
so all these can get called and actually

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,000
can return their results

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:04,400
as part of the the query that you make

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,840
so they get they get mixed into the

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,080
tables

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,200
uh there's you know a bunch of system

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,559
tables

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,159
that keep track of things

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:19,200
um procedures uh

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,640
and these are the ten tables

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,679
that that this

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,080
sample database has

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,320
and these are all linked together via

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,000
various

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:36,960
joined joins and and what they call um

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,080
primary keys and uh and they're linked

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,480
via these

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:47,520
key characters okay let's see

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:50,320
let's see

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
it's probably not i can't make it any

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,679
larger

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,039
um but you get the idea it's a lot of

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:59,120
complexity

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,760
that's built into any kind of database

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,559
and i guess the point of this is that

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,960
it's

00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,919
it's you can get all the information out

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
in a consistent

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,520
and reliable way and that's that's one

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,200
of the great things

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:16,000
about using a database that it does

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,600
you can you can rely on the fact that

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,120
once it gets committed the data gets

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,080
committed you can get it back

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,640
in the same way and then link it into

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,240
different

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,760
in different ways to different

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,360
information and

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,279
see the information in a completely

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,640
different light

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,620
so yeah so that's that

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,240
all there i've already installed

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,120
[Music]

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,960
i've already installed django already

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,720
installed the database driver

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,080
um and

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
there's something called which i just

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,279
ran that program let's see there's a

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,840
whole lot of errors there

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:57,840
let's try and get another one another

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
window

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,480
okay so there is something called

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,840
inspect db

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:11,840
now the thing is that they

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
means

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,200
there are two i'll do something out of

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,200
water here um

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,279
so inspect bb is something that

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,900
literally

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,119
having given it

00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,119
[Music]

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,440
so this is the django settings file

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:36,640
django settings file

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,760
um talk you give it the database name

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,360
the path which is the connection string

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,799
the host name which is also part of the

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,870
connection string you'll see that down

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,520
there the username

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,000
[Music]

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,320
host and where the where the database

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,320
lives

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,000
now you put that into django and you

00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,159
fire it up

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,880
and it blows up if you try and do

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,720
anything with it because it doesn't know

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,000
the database all it's done all you've

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,520
done is given it

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,000
a a um

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,720
a username and a password and an address

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,400
and

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,480
django goes away and goes to i don't

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,600
understand any of this and besides i

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,600
i don't even you're not fulfilling my

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,039
requirements of having my set of user

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,720
tables and

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,780
stuff that i need in that database

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,799
so to do that

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:30,559
[Music]

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,880
there's a simple command called migrate

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,000
and once you've migrated it creates all

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
these different

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,760
tables and different different sessions

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,000
and

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,000
table tables and things like that and

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,960
then you end up

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,760
with this version as opposed to this

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,039
version

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:53,840
so it's made some changes um most

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:56,240
the most the most obvious one is

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,720
in the tables so here we've got 10

00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,720
tables

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,880
10 tables but after you run the migrate

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,799
those 10 tables turn into 20 tables

00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,240
and those 20 tables have got

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,159
authentication

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,399
things and and permissioning and

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,600
different group things

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,760
django login log service

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,880
um something called migrations where you

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,600
can actually migrate

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,960
you can add changes to tables and

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,240
migrate them and then

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,919
they become part of the the

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:35,279
the whole database etc so

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,279
it adds another 10 tables

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,520
so having done that having now you've

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:42,799
seen that

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:46,480
how do we get how do we

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:48,000
so i've created

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,240
you know i've done migrate and it's

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,200
created those 10 tables extra but it

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,559
still doesn't know

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,799
about anything else so the way to find

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,840
out

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,039
give it the information as to what that

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,440
is

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:04,159
is and this is also so you can use it

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
within

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:11,200
your system and

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:14,480
make modifications to it um

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,480
let's see what's up

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,480
let's do it

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,919
so i expect db into database and comes

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:31,520
back with a whole lot of garbage

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:34,640
but it's actually not garbage um it's

00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,080
the is the django and the python

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:41,279
models for every single table

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,240
is discovered and you can put that into

00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:45,679
your

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,650
into your databases as a model dot pi

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,880
um and you can

00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,720
[Music]

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,360
you can modify it you can do things like

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,360
give give different uh

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,200
have different things show up instead of

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,240
it being project of debt

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,080
budget for example there

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,799
you can turn it into something that's

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,559
like project department budget

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,799
and things like that so it displays

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,960
properly on the screen

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,960
and having i don't even think you need

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,990
to do that actually

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,399
but having

00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:20,399
[Music]

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,840
just from do the run server command

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,120
hopefully this isn't going to blow up

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,159
and we get a little bit of a warning

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,440
that something is not

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:31,200
quite right um before you if you did a

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,640
before you run the migrate you'll come

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,000
up with an error saying there's

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,799
there's a whole bunch of things that

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,440
need to be you need to

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:51,840
add in order to be able to connect

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:51,840
and now we get to that

00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:05,840
so we now got a system that is running

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:05,840
off that database we've just shown

00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,440
oh let's get that right

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
great okay this is where

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,519
okay there's probably something in the

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,240
back end that i need to i didn't

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,480
do because i this was working on this

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,440
literary until about an hour and a half

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
ago

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:47,840
but you will get if you've ever had

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:47,840
django use django

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,969
[Music]

00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,300
essentially it you'll get

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,399
something that looks um

00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:05,360
[Music]

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,360
very much like

00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:12,680
[Music]

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
okay

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,840
he said

00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:36,599
[Music]

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,159
and uh unfortunately the demo has only

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,120
gone so far

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,120
but it's uh

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,880
no i don't have network connectivity to

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,760
that site but um

00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,760
you get you come up

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,240
yeah that's what you get um

00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,000
so you'll come up with an admin an admin

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,559
field and you can change any data

00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,679
and anything um and that's the way you

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:14,320
get started

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,240
with django is using the admin tool and

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,640
then you start writing your code

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,320
but in terms of doing something

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,919
lightweight i mean django is lightweight

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,840
enough even though it doesn't seem like

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:25,919
it sometimes

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,519
um and it makes

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,880
a perfect match in certain circumstances

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,600
um with uh with fiber um

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,200
it's compact it's it's lightweight it's

00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:40,080
solid as a rock it

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,519
just you know keeps on keeps on running

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,960
where other things don't

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,720
and you don't need to look after it

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,159
there's nothing to look after it's

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,880
it just sits there and runs you don't

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,960
have to you don't have to do anything to

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:53,039
make sure things you know things that

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,480
were working you know continue working

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,240
and all that kind of stuff it just sits

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,240
there and in the background it does what

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:01,760
it says it's going to do

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,760
and that's kind of it

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,639
i'm going to do this up here here

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,919
um and that's how we ended up making

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:13,280
that

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:15,520
wave suite and so just in summary

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,520
um

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,480
firebird integration with with library

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,919
office

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,839
well it was a good thing i'm not sure

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,359
what the future of it is because they

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,200
had some problems with the client with

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,879
the client side code which probably if

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,679
anyone's interested they should uh take

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,310
a look at doing

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,839
that helping helping out there um

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,599
[Music]

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,119
it may or may not be on you already on

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,879
your machine if you've got liberal

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,200
office and you're 15.2

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:46,079
i'm not sure about 3 15.3 in philippe um

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,440
it might still be there um but the most

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,560
important thing really is

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,599
it's fast it's fully featured

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,200
[Music]

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,800
it's a very small footprint it's multi

00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,200
it handles multi users very well

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,050
um and it's very lightweight on memory

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,680
as well so

00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,720
[Music]

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,440
and i guess the the key takeaway is

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,800
if someone is saying to you or something

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,560
you're deciding that you

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,359
need a database to do something

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,599
someone's telling you i want to do this

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:18,400
take a look at the the use case take a

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,839
look at what

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,720
really is needed um take a look at the

00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,720
way that

00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:26,000
you know this the size of the staff the

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,960
i.t staff and see

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,599
you know do they have a db admin person

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,880
there to

00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,599
to do the work um which you'd kind of do

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,280
need if

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,440
on if you're running anything larger

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,880
than sql light or

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,480
or firebird um and so keep an eye for an

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,079
open mind it could be

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,680
you know the usual choice could be the

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,119
wrong choice for the use case

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,560
um and i'll upload all this code

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,960
um and up to that

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,400
link um and there's a couple of pages

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,400

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,440
for uh you know more to find out more

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,280
