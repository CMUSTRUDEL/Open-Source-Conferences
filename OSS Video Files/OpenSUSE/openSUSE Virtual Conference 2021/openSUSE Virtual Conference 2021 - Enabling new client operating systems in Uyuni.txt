How difficult can it be

When Uyuni started, it only supported SLES and RHEL as clients. In late 2018, Ubuntu was added. From there, it all went uphill: SLES Expanded Support, openSUSE, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Debian, Alma Linux, Amazon Linux, Alibaba Cloud Linux and Rocky Linux. As of today, Uyuni supports all the major enterprise Linux distributions. How difficult was that? Pau Garcia from Uyuni and Jack Aboutboul from Alma Linux talk about that.
