How difficult can it be

When Uyuni started, it only supported SLES and RHEL as clients. In late 2018, Ubuntu was added. From there, it all went uphill: SLES Expanded Support, openSUSE, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Debian, Alma Linux, Amazon Linux, Alibaba Cloud Linux and Rocky Linux. As of today, Uyuni supports all the major enterprise Linux distributions. How difficult was that? Pau Garcia from Uyuni and Jack Aboutboul from Alma Linux talk about that.

to this

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,480
talk about enabling new operating

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,719
systems in uni

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,480
my name is paul garcia i'm the proctor

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,560
and technical project manager of suse

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,279
manager i work for souza and i'm joined

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,320
today by

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,480
jack from alma linux

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,560
hi everyone yeah i i used to be a debian

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,800
developer kde developer and a lot more

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,359
things you can find me around online

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,359
in in ioc in guitar

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,200
yeah chuck what about you hey everyone

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,360
i'm jack

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,040
i'm the community manager of alma linux

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,039
some of you might know me from the

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,520
fedora community

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,360
i was at red hat for a long time as a

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,160
community architect there

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,640
working on several open source projects

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,920
and other

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,840
outreach initiatives and basically i

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,199
fell in love with open source and never

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,440
looked back

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,960
which is a great thing and you can

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,400
usually find me

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,720
on irc on the bear chat and also uh

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,840
that's my email if anyone wants to get

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
in touch which is jack

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,759
on the linux.org okay

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,880
let's get started so what is your uni

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,759
i'm going to go through a brief

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,840
presentation of

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,680
uni you may have seen these slides

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
already in some other presentation

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,240
so uni is a systems management solution

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,560
and it covers essentially 80

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,840
of your day-to-day needs as a systems

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,520
administrator as

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,079
it operator when when linux is around

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,600
get auditing reporting patching

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,119
installation software configuration

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,560
management both with

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,960
salt and ansible it does virtualization

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,079
a unit runs on opensuse leap although

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,840
there's a community port

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,079
center whereas in the works it's already

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,560
functional to some degree

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,280
and it supports a lot of linux operating

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
systems

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,479
essentially any enterprise leading is

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,640
supported

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,280
by uni and even some non-enterprise

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,520
links are supported too

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,479
the architecture of the uni is the

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,799
typical

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
client server architecture so here we

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
have the unit server

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,239
and here we have the the uni proxies

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840
which are an optional

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,080
element of the infrastructure when you

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,120
have a thousand or tens of thousands of

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,560
clients

00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,400
so typically you can attach systems

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,239
directly to the server but when you go

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
over three four thousand

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,440
client systems you will want to use

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,680
these proxies

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,720
and that way you can easily reach 15 20

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,360
000 clients per uni server or even more

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,319
we have

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,599
cases of 30 000 clients per system in

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,200
the case that you have

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,959
beyond those 25 30 000 systems you can

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,160
also use a multi-server architecture

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,640
what we call the hub

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,280
where you have another server the hub

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,519
server

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,319
over there acting as an orchestrator

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,080
between

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:59,040
several uni servers

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,840
the origins of uni are in a project

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,920
founded by

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,159
red hat a long time ago called spacewalk

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,440
but we forked uh suse for that

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,319
that project in 2018 and created

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,879
uni so since then we have our own

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,239
project

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,120
we are around upstream

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,480
the features is what you would expect of

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,080
any assistance management

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,920
solution you can deploy you can patch

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,920
you can do the service pack migration on

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,760
operating systems that require this

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,760
you can do confusion management you can

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,799
do bare metal or

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,799
um or virtual machines you can schedule

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
actions to be performed in in the future

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
you

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,879
you just you don't need to to sit in

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,239
front of something where you want to

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,400
execute that

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,840
and of course you can also do compliance

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,080
manager with openscap and cv

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,400
audits everything in uni is available

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,120
in three ways you can use the web ui the

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,439
api or command line tool so what we find

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
is typically users will start with the

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,400
web ui as they get

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,080
knowledge they move to the command line

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,560
tools and ultimately

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
they write their own api skips

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,959
potentially integrating

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:12,400
some other tools like servicenow or

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,400
jira or some other cmdb for instance

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,680
there's we uni added a lot on on top of

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
what

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,199
spacewalk provided back in the day so

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,400
there's transparent integration with

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,080
salt and ansible

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,680
we can manage uh systems on any

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,520
any place essentially not only on

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,759
premise club uh

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
hybrid cloud multi-cloud the thing about

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,960
the uni is you don't really know where

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,600
your systems are you don't really care

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,360
actually

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,440
because to you it's all the same there

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,440
are many systems

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,840
uh we have this a great feature called

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,680
container cycle management so typically

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
on production systems you don't want to

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,960
deploy

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,199
your software directly you want to go

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,199
through this typical

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,400
environment so development testing and

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,479
production

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,320
what content my second engine does is it

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,320
creates different software channels

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,600
and you can promote software as you

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,639
typically do in any

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
it governance workflow there's required

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,280
actions there's

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,120
you can even build operating system and

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,960
continue images to make sure that

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,560
the starting point for everybody for

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,280
developers or for

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,479
new applications is is always what you

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,240
have better

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,759
as i said there's a compliance there

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,680
between management even

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,720
with h a high availability

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
virtualization clusters with kvm or zen

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,960
that's a feature that we are going to

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,880
introduce in a few weeks

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,080
and there's also monitoring we have a

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
standardized on

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,000
on promises and grafana which is the

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,400
cloud native stack these days

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,080
and uh if you know salt you know that

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,199
there's a very powerful feature called

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,759
the the formulas we have uh created

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,479
something

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
called formulas with forms which is like

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,600
a

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,800
form a ui that you can create for those

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,560
soul formulas

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,560
and and we are also working on providing

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,120
that for ansible for the answer of

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,120
playbooks

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
as i said uni supports most of the

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
enterprise linux operating systems

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,479
of course all the sushi operating

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,560
systems all the

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,720
rail clones or rail center os oracle

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,960
linux alma

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
and and then we have some more exhaust

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,560
operating systems of course there's

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,199
ubuntu which is getting very popular

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,880
debian and then we have amazon linux

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
alibaba cloud linux

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,080
we have it's lee micro which is a new

00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,039
minimal operating system introduced by

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,560
by suse recently and we will keep adding

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,360
new operating systems in

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,759
uni and this talk is exactly about that

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:39,199
how we added support for alma linux

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,240
jack tell us about the album everybody

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,680
how are you okay

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,280
great all right so uh on the linux

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
uh yeah let's uh get the next slide pow

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,840
if we can

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,440
so that's our project okay so who

00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,080
or what is alma linux um so we're

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,080
uh we're an open source and forever free

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,599
enterprise linux distribution and

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
community

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,800
we're one-to-one binary compatible with

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,560
rel

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,599
we're centos alternative as well so

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,560
if anyone is looking for

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,240
an alternative to centos you've come you

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,919
know you know where to look

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,520
uh we're also a 501c6 nonprofit

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,960
and that's very important because that

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
means that we're owned governed and

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,680
driven by the community

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
there's no single entity that owns uh

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,639
any

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
of the intellectual property any of the

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,240
trademarks

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
um any of you know that that type of

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,080
stuff it's all

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,000
everything is owned by the nonprofit and

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,319
that's to ensure continuity you

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,160
basically want to make sure that uh what

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,800
happened with centos does not happen

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,039
again

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
and um this is one of the ways of making

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,400
that happen

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,919
and also i want to say we're graciously

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,639
sponsored and supported by

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,000
awesome uh open source focused companies

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,080
and organizations

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,080
uh all of them are listed on our site

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,280
but um you know we have the backing

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,479
of uh places like aws um

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,759
arm which has been phenomenal uh

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,360
equinix metal um there's so many uh high

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,960
velocity i want to mention there are

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,000
primary mirror sponsors so i gotta

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,039
mention them too

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,639
uh cpanel um lots of places they're all

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,080
on the site i'm not gonna bore you with

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
all that right now

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,440
um and i think one of the uh

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,199
great things about our team is that many

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,479
of us have been doing this for over a

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
decade or more

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,440
so we're really well seasoned when it

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,839
comes to doing rail rebuilds

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,360
um and i think that you know the product

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,399
definitely shows that

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,480
the os is rock solid we were able to

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,600
rebuild rel 8.4

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,160
um in only three or four days after uh

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,240
red hat

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,160
actually released it which is like if

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,160
you know anything about the history

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,440
of the community that's like amazing

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
speed um

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,120
and and we want to we want to make that

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,800
even shorter for the future and we have

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,080
plans on making that even shorter for

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,320
the future

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,200
and uh what else we're it's we're

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,600
available now

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,279
um we've actually the the first release

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,480
which was 8.3

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,920
uh was out on march 30th um we we're now

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,519
on 8.4

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,680
um our arm is in beta and that's

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,880
actually by the time you watch this

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:24,240
um it's probably going to be stay stable

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,120
or very shortly stable and we have some

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,320
great features

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,000
like uh secure boot openscap support we

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,760
support errata

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,320
you know it's just really a well

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,120
seasoned very well developed

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,120
uh enterprise linux distribution

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,760
so what am i doing at a at a uni talk

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,399
and an open suse conference

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,120
well i love to i love this quote not all

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,920
those who want

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,920
are lost for any of the uh lord of lord

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,800
of the rings hobbit fans out there

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,560
so um we're definitely definitely didn't

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,880
wander to the wrong place that's for

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,880
sure

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,360
let's get the uh the next slide so um

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,720
why are we here because

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,040
we believe in community and

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,519
collaboration um i think you know from

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,120
from the minute the project was released

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,440
uh we set out to start

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
working with everyone in the community

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,440
um across

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,399
you know really everywhere um and and we

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,200
just want to

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,720
um we decided that we wanted to be a

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
bridge and build bridges

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,320
and and try to bring communities

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,600
together i know there's lots of

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,360
um factions in different places and you

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,320
know that's that's kind of the nature of

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,079
open source

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,760
and i think uh you know one of one of

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,720
the things that we definitely think we

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,000
can improve

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,079
is like cross um cross product

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,920
cross project collaboration um

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,839
uh definitely the the centos

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,920
announcement uh when that happened

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,760
uh i don't know how many people here

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,760
really very familiar about that but that

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,640
kind of caused a lot of confusion in the

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,279
community

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,240
it also caused a lot of fun that's not

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,000
good for anyone

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
um i think that you know we want to we

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,760
want to calm things down

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,680
uh we want to we want to bring things

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,720
back to a state of normalcy like they

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,160
were before

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,560
um also obs is great i think um you know

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,600
it was definitely the inspiration

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:20,000
for how we architected our build system

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,640
and our build system uh you'll hear more

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,560
about that

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
uh in the future if you follow the

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,760
project

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,600
um and then you know bottom line i feel

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,000
like we're all in this together um

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
everyone doing open source uh shares a

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,120
common mission

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,200
and a common vision you know certainly a

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,839
rising tide lifts all boats

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,320
and uh open source is definitely a big

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,800
very big part of that ecosystem

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,240
especially you know being another uh rpm

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
based ecosystem

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
there's a lot of room for working

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,160
together there and a lot of room

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
for collaboration and like i said you

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,279
know our philosophy

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,040
and our goals is to foster

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,440
cross-community collaboration

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,120
across the whole ecosystem and you know

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
when we released um

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,639
you know a couple of uh people from the

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,000
uni team reached out

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:08,320
and and wanted to um collaborate

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,160
um and and we kind of reached out

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,160
simultaneously i should say

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,279
and you know it was just very fruitful

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,399
like we came together

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:18,320
um the code was written and uh here we

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,880
go you know another project supporting

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,600
us

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,560
and another uh project that we can be a

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,320
part of and

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,480
another great conference with great

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,880
people that we can come and participate

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
in

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,680
and i think that's really you know

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,200
that's what the spirit of community is

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:36,399
all about and that's why

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,399

to make sure that great great open

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
source is produced

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,399
uh by just listening to everybody trying

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,079

keep working together i think me and

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,040
powell like have a weekly meeting now

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,079
that we get together and try to find

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,320
things to work on

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,480
so uh again you know if anyone's

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,079
interested uh we're glad to be here

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,759
we're very humbled to be here i want to

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,360
say thank you to everybody

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,880
and my daughter wants to say thank you

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,079
to everybody she's walking down the

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,680
stairs right now

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,480
even though i told her not to come and

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,800
uh yeah thank you everybody and uh

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,639
we'll let you uh do some of some more of

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,240
the dirty work

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,639
thank you zach okay so now this talk is

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,279
about

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,560
adding new client operating systems and

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,199
i'm going to go

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,959
knee-deep into that so don't be scared

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:26,800
by the following slides

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,040
there's a summary in the end and there's

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,959
references to pull requests so

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,480
what do you have to do when you need to

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,519
add a new operating system in

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,839
uni first things to consider are

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,519
is the new client operating system they

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,800
want to add available on the open build

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
service and this is very important

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,920
because

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,519
the the the uni is built on obs so

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,600
another important thing to consider is

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,000
the new client abbreviation of an

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,160
existing

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,759
operating system that is already

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,000
supported

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,040
do i want to add the new client

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,240
operating system

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,240
as only with salt you know that in uni

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,079
you can manage clients with the

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,199
traditional stock that comes from the

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,760
old space wall times but also with with

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,839
salt

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,360
and increasingly we support clients and

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,640
salt only because there's a richer

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,799
feature set there there are some

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,760
features that are no not supported at

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,360
all with the traditional stack

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,439
and also an important thing if you are

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,679
going to support with salt which you

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,559
you should do then is the client

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,880
operating system

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,039
known already by short or do i need to

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,080
enable this new operating system

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,240
installed so first thing is the new

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
client operating system in obs

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,320
if yes you're lucky you're good to go

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,120
but if not and that was the case without

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,440
my linux

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,480
you just need to ask the obs admins to

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,360
add it and they will do that

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,640
for added to just a few days to that in

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,080
some cases

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,240
we could have considered for instance

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,760
without my linux to reuse the binaries

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,600
from another operating system

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,280
for instance for alma we could have used

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,919
the centos client tools that

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,880
we already had but since centos 8 is

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,799
dying

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,640
we are actually building new binaries

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,960
based on alma linux and that's the base

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,039
for

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:12,080
all the railclones in the future in uni

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,520
then uh for instance for for slash you

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,640
could use the

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,520
opensuse leap binaries now also since

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
this closing

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,200
the the lip gap has finished now now

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,600
then

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,039
next thing is is this a variation of an

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,080
existing client

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,960
in our case yes alma linux is a rel-8

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,360
clone

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,280
so all the complex stuff which is the

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,240
modules and upstream

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,520
uh that special casing is already

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,679
implemented

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,320
so yeah that part we didn't need to

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,039
really delve into that

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,200
as i said we could have built the use

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,120
the center was eight client tools but

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,120
in our case we are going to phase up

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,039
centos eight client tools and

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,520
actually adopt al malino's as the new

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,000
base for all of these uh what

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,160
so-called enterprise linux class

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,200
operating systems

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,880
salt only or salt and traditional so

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,919
linux is officially supported

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,160
only as a salt client but

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
actually we've implemented also a

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,559
traditional

00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,720
stack support in in code

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,679
just because the the two of us that

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,360
implemented that

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,840
are not actually developers so you can

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,960
see that we didn't it was more difficult

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,640
for us to say

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,080
i will not implement a traditional stack

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,919
rather than to just implement everything

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,360
because we were actually it's a scoping

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,520
code from other operating systems

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,440
and then if the new client operation say

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,640
is not known by salt which was the case

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,559
of alma linux

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,039
you need to add a grain and i think a

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:45,840
grain is rather easy you just need to

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,600
to go to salt this is the upstream and

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,520
but you you need to that in the open

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:53,280
suse package also

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,520
which is usually faster than

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,799
salt accepting your grain and it's

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
rather easy you just need to

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,559
set um like a code name a string and

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
that's it

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:03,919
so it's two places it's really easy and

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,400
then you have to say this

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,600
alma linux is of the red hat family and

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,480
with that's all we know

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,600
what package manager to use how to

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,360
resolve conflicts and all of that

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,799
then you need to set up a development

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,320
branch for yourself

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,520
you need to fork and clone source

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,000
of uni then you need to create a fork

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,280
in obs to actually build the packages so

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,280
that when you uh

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,200
write code you can actually build those

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,720
packages and deploy that and make sure

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,320
that everything is all right

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,000
including database migrations and

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,640
everything

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,600
you need if you're having a new client

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
operating system

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,760
you need to fork some client tools or to

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,559
start from scratch but i would advise to

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,320
just

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,840
select one of the of the supported

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,000
client tools already

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:54,240
and with that start from there

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,320
there's a wiki page explaining how to

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,360
how to set up all of these in full

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,360
detail

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,200
then where what's the code that you need

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,799
to touch so

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,240
this is the easy part and this is the

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,000
minimum that you need to do

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,600
there's some python enabled and some

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,200
enablement install that i essentially

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,000
already showed most of it

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,760
and that there's an ini file which lists

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,799
the the repertories of the new client

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
operating system

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,880
if you want to add some niceties in the

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,039
web ui

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
then you can go and implement some java

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,280
and sql code and this is actually like

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,080
75 percent of the work

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,080
so yeah you you can keep it minimal and

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,000
it will it's fully functional but if you

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,960
want to to have all the

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,120
the beautiful things in the web ui do

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,120
the java part and sql part

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,440
so repositories we just need to add

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,080
these to this space well common channels

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,200
i have added these repertoires the tpg

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,320
key

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,200
and everything so this is for xatc 64

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,600
when there's r64 we will also add it

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,600
that's trivial mostly if your

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,559
repositories are protected by some token

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,039
certificate or

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,679
using a password then things get a bit

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,120
hairy

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,840
but this was not the case without my

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,440
linux so it was really easy

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,039
that's a nice thing of open source and

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,080
free

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,840
then we need to tell um

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
the client what client wants to use

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,880
because um

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,799
this whole package it might not be

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,520
available in on alma linux

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,520
as it is the case actually you will need

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,520
to add e-pail and we don't want you to

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,679
need to add e-pel because it's a huge

00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,640
thing

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,880
then python so uni has a concept what we

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,200
call the boots are reported because

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
you can only register assistants can

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
access the the report is made available

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,480
by uni

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
but what if you are not registered yet

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,400
how do you access the minimal reporter

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,480
with

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,000
the packages in order to register that's

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,240
what we call the bootstrap

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,240
repository and there's several ways to

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,240
register you can initiate from the web

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,039
ui or you can imitate from the client

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,799
side

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,799
uh using what we call a bootstrap

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,960
subscript and in order to enable that

00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,159
bootstrap script essentially you need to

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,720
tell uni hey this is the file that you

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,280
need to look

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,480
at this alma linux release match this

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,360
string and

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,200
if it's that then you will have to use

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,640
those packages that bootstrap but if you

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
remember that was exactly

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,720
the grain that we used in the previous

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,640
slide

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
then you have to tell it what package is

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,960
actually to provide in that boots are

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,440
reportedly

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,159
i mean in our case i'm telling use the

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,480
same

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,559
what's called the expanded support 8

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,000
which is another rail clone

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,240
because for we need the same packages

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,280
for the rail clones so this is also

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
pretty trivial and

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,480
they will be stored in this place in the

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,600
uni server hard disk

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,200
then i need to solve how to identify the

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,320
client operating system and it's very

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,840
easy

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,840
what we are going to do is we are going

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,200
to test if this file is if this file

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,799
exists almost release

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
then i'm going to say this is an alma

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,559
linux system

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,320
easy as i said there's also

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,880
initiate the registration of the client

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,000
from the web from the uni server web ui

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,640
in that case you need to to tell it

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,159
to tell uni hey this is the the reporter

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,559
that you have to serve

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,320
and this is just using another grain

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,919
from salt

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,919
uh and yeah rather easy actually because

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:19,360
this is all implemented

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,000
when you add the gray into to that chord

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:25,039
this this os major release will

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,039
automatically appear

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,880
then uh the all the communication

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,960
between the uni server and the and the

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,279
alma linux client is going to be

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,360
encrypted and secured by an ssl

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,520
certificate so i need to tell

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,799
the clients hey you have to trust this

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,000
certificate that

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:45,760
is described in this red hat 8 as sls

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,080
file actually uh we use the same message

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,320
for

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,960
all the clients for the operating system

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,279
so but for historical reasons

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,039
we keep saying yeah we keep different

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,520
files describing that we are simplifying

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:57,600
that

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,159
because it doesn't make any sense to

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,000
keep it complex

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:05,440
then uh this is so with this we for the

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
basic path so with this

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,320
that was the first part of the

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,440
enablement that we did for alma linux

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,919
and with this alma

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
is fully functional as a client already

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,480
next thing that we can do

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,520
is if i want to show in the web ui

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,400
uh where do these packages come from and

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,440
i want to say hey

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,880
this rpm comes from alma linux

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:31,520
then i have to add the gpg key

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,520
to is on this provider called alma linux

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,600
and then we get into the 30 files of

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,159
java that you need to touch

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,720
now this spot is only for convenience

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,559
really

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,000
if you want to be able to use check

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,000
boxes in the uni server

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,400
in the web ui to enable monitoring

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,799
container building os building

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,240
and and then in the case of suse manager

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,880
which is the downstream of

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,480
uni supported full supported by suse if

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,360
you want to show the product name

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,000
instead of just an unknown product

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,320
string

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
in the system details you need to do

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,000
this um

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,960
java enablement the the what you need to

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,480
do

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
everything that you need to add to the

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,720
java part is

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,279
provided by this call soft call that is

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,039
local

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,279
grains that items you run this on an

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,600
alma linux box and then you will get all

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,360
the values which are the os grain the os

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,400
full name and os family

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,400
grain with that you're done because alma

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,120
linux is matched in inside

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
internally in uni by the rail 8 matching

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,600
code

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,159
so we just need to do some special

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,640
casing in some places but that's about

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,640
it

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,120
i'm going to go very quickly about this

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,480
so we will define this

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,200
server string this this constant to be

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:45,120
able to match the grains

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,880
then here's the special case in that

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,000
that i said earlier

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,720
i want to be able to tell all my linux

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,799
and

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,080
yeah in the in the semiline i'm telling

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,279
also amazon linux

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,480
from rail um because otherwise the the

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,559
alma linux uh

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,679
systems and amazon links will get the

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,279
the

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,000
rail eight reporters another thing i'm

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,640
going to say

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
okay match the os grain provided by salt

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,840
if it's

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,240
alma linux then i have to do this which

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,440
is

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,480
running some remote commands

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:22,320
more testing against the os grade in

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,440
different places for alma linux

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,720
even more testing of this uh alma alma

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,159
linux release

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,840
file and here am i i'm

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,760
connecting especially with the java part

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,480
with the saw path these

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:37,279
this detect plane rail but what it does

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
is uh

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,559
it is this goes to the code that

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:44,559
connects the

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:47,520
the assault bus the zeroing cue bus

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,200
with the java part that comes in the uni

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,320
server

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,760
even more uh really almost release file

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,200
you can see that this is

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:59,840
spread across a lot of places

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
and here is the the the final place

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,880
where we actually say

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,720
i'm passing this parameter which is the

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,240
content of the alma release file

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,279
advantageous release file

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,279
and that's going to be what what the

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:13,520
all the previous code that was checking

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,360
for the alma linux release

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,039
will get of course if there's no alma

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,120
linux release file because this is i

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,320
don't know slash or

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,000
bc linux or mcafee linux whatever this

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,320
will be empty and that's why this is

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,240
optional code

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,720
we keep connecting the thing so this is

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,200
the contents we are reading the contents

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,120
of this alma linux and that's about it

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,440
so in summary

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,080
you need to uh do an edit like 10 files

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,799
python and salt and that's the easy part

00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,640
and then

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,240
in order to get the nice parts in the

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,520
web ui you need to touch in 30

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,279
additional files

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:53,840
which is a bit cumbersome we really want

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:57,039
to simplify this

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,080
so but even though it's 40 files that

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,679
you need to touch for

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:04,720
a real clone or a debian clone or a

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,799
sls or opensuse clone it took us like

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,200
three days by two non-developers there

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:09,760
was

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
julio working with me julio is our

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,320
system manager and

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,840
uni release engineer if you attend the

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,600
uni community hours last five

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,880
of the month you know him because he's

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,120
quite often there

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,640
and myself i'm the proctor i have not

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,720
coded for years

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,240
i'm actually a club manager my kind of

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,320
product guy

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,399
so it took us three days in the suse

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,600
hack week back in february

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,360
to implement this and my question to you

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,720
is what's the next operating system that

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
you are going to enable because i have

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,240
this code that has

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,120

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,399

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,919
everybody codes we love to code

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,200
and as i said uni is the upstream

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,960
project for suse manager

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,279
if you need a supported supported

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,720
call call suse if not uni is committee

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,480
supported we have a monthly meeting

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,799
every last friday a month

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,520
we run an open source elip there's a an

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,600
unfinished

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,480
port to center west you can also help

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,279
with that we release almost every

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,399
and we are a rolling release model so

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,240
when there's a

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,600
bug we are not going to fix it in the

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,600
current release we're going to tell you

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,039
just move to the next release

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,440
the differences between systematic and

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,919
the uni are minimal essentially

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,720
you have to use a command line tool

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,159
instead of a

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,159
ui wizard and in a uni we enable

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,520
all the translations which are many by

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,919
default

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,640
uh and in system manager we only enable

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,240
the the

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,880
transitions that have been reviewed by

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,880
official translators

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,039
and that's about it so you can join us

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,799
