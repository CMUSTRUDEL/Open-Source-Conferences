00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,719
hello

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,719
i'm chris duvan

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:22,320
i've been with susan for a bit

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,359
more than two and a half years now

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,400
as part of the eni department

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,840
i am in the open qa

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,840
development team

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:41,520
and i work there as a scrum master

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,520
i go by the them pronouns

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:48,719
and i'm going to talk about

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,000
a non-technical topic

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:59,840
which is about being inclusive

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,840
and embracing diversity

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,520
i'm going to ask you about

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,080
ice cream i'm going to tell you a little

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,240
bit about

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
pronouns i'm going to tell you a little

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,560
bit

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:20,080
about gendered language

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:23,680
and inclusive or not so inclusive

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,479
terminology and

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:31,759
most importantly i'm going to

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,079
give you an idea why you should

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,079
care

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,159
so what is this about ice cream

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,439
i'm going to ask a very simple question

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,040
to start with do you like chocolate

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,040
or vanilla ice cream

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,399
think about it a moment

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,759
maybe you're thinking i love chocolate

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,360
ice cream

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,719
it's amazing or

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,560
maybe you're thinking

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,560
i really love banana ice cream

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,800
or maybe you're thinking i do not like

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,760
any ice cream at all some people don't

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,080
like ice cream

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,080
some people simply don't like sweets

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,239
or maybe you do like

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,080
sherbet strawberry flavor pinots

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,120
right you might wonder why am i assuming

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,440
that you like ice cream in the first

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,440
place

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:52,160
so the second question you look at a

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,360
person

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,400
and you're thinking hmm

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,200
can i guess this person's gender by

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,200
looking at them

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:10,560
and in a similar way how do you

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,760
make a guess on somebody's gender

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,040
how do you make a guess on what ice

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,400
cream flavor

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:23,040
somebody likes you might see

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:26,239
the comparison um drawing here

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:33,840
maybe you should actually just ask

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,840
rather than making a guess

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,959
and furthermore the certain

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,040
speech patterns that you're

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:51,920
used to or that you may be used to

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,920
like hello ladies and gentlemen

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,239
common greetings and you invite people

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,200
to

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,319
something when you start an email when

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,480
you start

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
conversation a meeting

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,640
maybe you're used to saying something

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,239
like we need a

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
man for this job

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,400
he should be experienced

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,519
he should have worked in this field for

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,639
several years

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,280
so we know he's good at his job

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,280
when we hire

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,160
might just sound perfectly fine to you

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,240
for now

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,919
so i have a few alternate versions

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,919
of these phrases

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
maybe you start to meet him saying hello

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,919
people

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,919
or simply hello or hello everyone

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,639
there's no need to assume

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,960
your audience you can keep it pretty

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,960
open

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,680
you can also say something like we need

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,800
someone

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,639
strong for this job

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,639
remember the previous phrase

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,080
we need a man for this job

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,120
or maybe we need someone strong for this

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,320
job

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:31,600
or maybe it's not actually

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,600
that important if it's a man a woman

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
because maybe the important thing is

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,240
that

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,280
you want someone experienced

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,479
so also when talking about

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:50,800
job candidates or talking about

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,000
other people in general that have

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,120
certain skills

00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,560
maybe you're talking about colleagues

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:03,520
or even friends and you're thinking

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,400
i could think of somebody who's able to

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
help

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,280
but they should have certain skills

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,479
to be able to do that and notice

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,759
how i use the singular

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,280
they i don't need to

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,880
specify regardless of what

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,479
i might think the potential

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,720
person looks like or where they come

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,720
from

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,120
and the difference is if you're

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:41,360
wondering why this matters

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,000
the difference is you make your language

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,560
more

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,560
inclusive

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,240
you leave the suggestion

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,400
that anyone can fill that

00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:00,000
position or help you out

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,160
or feel welcome when you're talking

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,199
to your audience when you're starting a

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,240
conversation

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,280
when um

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,240
when they receive your email and

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
when they're reading it

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,880
there's not much of a chance of

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:22,000
accidentally making people feel

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,160
unwelcome someone might read the way

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,440
you're phrasing it and think

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,360
it doesn't sound like you need me

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,960
the way you're describing it even if the

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,599
person can help

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,599
skill-wise

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,560
so consider that the skills here

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,599
might be the thing that is more

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,639
important

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,680
than the particular gender

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,680
of a person

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,840
and you may have noticed how i

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,759
was already using the singular

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,879
they so they

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,319
them um and also

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,759
there is

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,240
a pronoun that's actually been around

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,720
for hundreds of years in the english

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,720
language

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,639
some people don't realize

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,440
how established this actually is in

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,440
modern english

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,240
and how antiquated you may sound

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:40,399
for using he as

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:44,959
the generic default

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:48,160
so basic examples

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
to keep in mind are

00:08:49,600 --> 00:09:00,480
they would be able to help me out

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:04,800
let's ask them for help

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:09,279
or let's see what

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,640
their requirements are

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,640
this is basic usage

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,959
and this can apply to anyone where you

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,959
simply don't know what gender

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,080
might apply an unknown person

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:33,279
or somebody who you just don't know

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:36,720
much about and also for this reason

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,680
i recommend doing

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,279
two things in line with that is one

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,160
thing which i did

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,720
at the start of the talk i announced my

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,720
pronouns

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:55,760
my pronouns being made them personally i

00:09:50,080 --> 00:10:00,240
prefer the neutral pronouns

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,519
other people might prefer he him

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,120
she her or even

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,160
neo pronouns like

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,959
z there for instance and there's all

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,200
sorts of

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:18,079
other ones and i'm not going to suggest

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
that you go and learn all that much

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,320
about pronouns

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,360
now but just consider

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:27,920
that you simply don't know

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,640
somebody's particular preference you

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,399
don't know what

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,399
ice cream they like you don't know what

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,399
pronouns they are most comfortable with

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,320
and you probably have an interest in

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,720
making them feel

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,720
welcome when you're talking to them

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,760
and at the end of the day you can always

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,120
ask

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,120
and this extends to various other

00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:02,320
topics if you would like

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,320
somebody's advice somebody's help

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,200
you can ask if you have questions about

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,040
somebody's preference

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,079
even the name somebody prefers to use

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,959
it's a really nice thing to ask you can

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,360
ask hey what name do you prefer to go by

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,320
what

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
pronouns do you prefer to use

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,240
and people will feel very welcome

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:34,079
if you ask them such things rather than

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,440
making a guess which may or may not

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,440
be correct

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:47,519
and i also have some examples um

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,800
in the context of user stories so

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,920
a very common thing is to to use

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,040
um names that

00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,480
may be less exclusive than you realize

00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,040
i'm not going to show you bad examples

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,480
i'm not only going to show you good

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,440
examples here

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,760
and if you're interested on my blog i

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,079
actually have a bunch more

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,360
so some of the fun ones i picture are

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,880
alison average

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,240
writes software kim looks out the window

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,519
when it rains

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,120
morgan doesn't like mondays

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,200
or robin loves jaywalking

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,079
you may have noticed a little pump a

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,079
snack in there

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,200
unisex names obviously very country back

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,399
country

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:41,519
but these are some that i think are

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
fairly broadly

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,600
established as unisex names

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,639
and this also applies to

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,680
terminology traditional terms like

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:04,000
white list lacklust master

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,120
slave you may or may not

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,920
know exactly what the issues are

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,920
with the terms

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,720
but to keep it simple my advice is

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,920
consider that some people are not

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,639
comfortable with

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,639
some of this traditional terminology

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,639
and you can again make people a lot more

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,800
comfortable

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,800
by default by allowing

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,639
terminology that is more inclusive

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,279
that doesn't have that baggage it

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,920
doesn't hurt to use those names

00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,680
in any case it doesn't hurt you that

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,959
makes other people feel good

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,160
which to my mind is a great thing so

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:55,680
use terms like allow list block list

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:59,360
primary main source sync

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,399
big projects like the linux kernel

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:05,760
or open qa

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,720
use inclusive terms

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
and maybe if you have a chance to

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,720
influence that

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,839
you can make this happen in more

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,839
projects that you're

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:21,600
involved with and also a couple fun

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:25,519
facts for you know fun

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:29,120
it is terminology has been thing since

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,800
1994 originally coming from the

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,560
music scene and sinclair

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,720
they actually has been around for about

00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,399
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,680
years now so it is not that new

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,199
unless you are incredibly

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,519
old um

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:54,399
yeah so um perhaps it was able to

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,760
provide some inspiration some food for

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,440
thoughts

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,880
consider if the terms diversity equity

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,959
and inclusions are things you want to

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,440
for instance approach at your company

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,320
i'm lucky to work for a company where

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,920
these are

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,519
terms that are very highly valued

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:21,040
and whereas support to make

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:24,240
everything more inclusive

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,839
and yeah to wrap this up

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,839
here's a little to-do list

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,160
use inclusive terminology don't

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:41,839
make assumptions and focus on the skills

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,839
the person provides

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:49,519
