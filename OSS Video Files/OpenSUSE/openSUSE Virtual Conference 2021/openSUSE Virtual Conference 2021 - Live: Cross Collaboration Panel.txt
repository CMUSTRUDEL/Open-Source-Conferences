00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,640
um

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
and so the format is going to go we're

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
roughly going to be here for an hour uh

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
if we

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,079
if we we could go that long we could go

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,520
much further

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,159
uh but just to start off

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,720
a few questions could could you each

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,720
like

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,799
tell me a little bit about yourself and

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,759
what you work on

00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,240
and we could start probably um we'll

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,719
start with ben

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,320

uh making sure we're

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040
actually sticking to it and generally

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
encouraging people to

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,640
to come along and follow the processes

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
i've been a member of the fedora

sort of tangentially participate in

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,560
several other open source projects as

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:43,280
well

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:47,519
um i guess we'll go with dan

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,000
besides that i also contribute a few

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,280
to a few open source projects i'm active

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,599
in the open

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,720
souza community as a package maintainer

and then i'm

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,159
also quite active in the fedora

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,040
community so i'm

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,599
part of the i3 special interest group

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,720
where we

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,360
released the i3 spin of fedora i

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,000
recently got elected into fesco in the

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,120
fedora

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:33,840
engineering steering committee so

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,840

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,560
and marie if you want to like tell us a

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,599
little bit about yourself and

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,840
take over um

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,319
my name is marie norden i am fedora's

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,319
community action and impact coordinator

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:55,040
that is a community uh agreed upon name

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,680
it's very long it means a community

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,959
manager

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,439
support person so i help

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,239
was a lot of the administrative type

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,799
things behind fedora but i also work on

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
community initiatives and i work with a

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,519
lot of the

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,040
non-coding teams uh giving them guidance

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,920
and support

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,359
and i also work with mentored projects

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,079
the dni team so i do

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,440
a whole bunch of stuff with fedora i'm

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,720
gonna pick on matt next

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,880
matthew next okay

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
um i'm matthew miller i am the fedora

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,800
project leader

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,520
that means i throw cats at ben i think

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,800
that's

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,800
the main responsibility

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,720
in seriousness fedora is a community

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,199
directed and community-led project

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,919
so it means that as a leader my job

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,400
isn't to tell the community where to go

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,320
but to help the community find its

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,120
collective direction and actually go

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
there

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,040
because i think the nature of

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,680
communities is to go in every direction

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,840
at once

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,600
and that's not always the most effective

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,080
way to get somewhere

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,919
it's an interesting search technique but

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,039
not not the most efficient one

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,840
so my job is to help us be more

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,840
efficient

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
really

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,080
um do i pick on the next person is that

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,560
how we're doing this

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,840
why why not why not neil go

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,880
oh all right then lovely um so my name

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,479
is neil gampa

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,520
i am uh

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,039
someone who's all over open source

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,240
stuff um professionally uh

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,560
i am a senior devops engineer at datto

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,120
working on software delivery stuff and

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,479
release engineering type things

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,720
but in the open source world i am

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,160
a long time member of both the fedora

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
and open souza communities

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,520
i've been a member of fesco for

00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,800
a year now uh but also i am a member of

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,880
the open sousa board since january

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,919
and i do quite a lot in

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,160
the kde sig and fedora as well as the

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,680
workstation working group

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,360
cloud working group a number of other

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,160
places and i'm also

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,680
in the open souza heroes team helping

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,360
build up infrastructure and setting up

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,840
solutions to help support

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,479
um the opensuse community to do you know

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,479
great things

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,280
and you work so much with adrian you

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:36,240
probably can just pass it on to him

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:40,080
that's true hi adrian hi nir

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,759
yeah i'm aaron i'm an open user i'm in

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,680
first place responsible for the open

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,520
build service

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,199
um yeah and then someone gets new ideas

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,199
how to build distributions

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:56,800
uh like this with a jump concept and i

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,120
have to work on that um

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,840
and apart from that i take care about

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,280
all the configurations from the

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,400
non-zoozo distributions in the build

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,360
service

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,039
so and try to help out people yeah and

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
in the old times i

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,800
actually was a project manager in the

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,240
open dooza project when it

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,280
started and before that i was doing the

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
kde desktop at

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,400
my daughter is messaging me that there's

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:27,440
a large bug in the backyard

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,360
and to come and save them but i think

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,520
this is one that she can probably handle

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,639
herself

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,639
sorry for the distraction

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:46,639
so it's not a panel blocking bug right

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,919
well so you know we kind of have some

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,319
list of questions that we

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,120
we kind of came up with together um and

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,319
i guess you know

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
we've already talked a little bit about

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,479
the background but sort of one of the

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,639
aspects of that was

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
you know how what sort of cross

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,840
collaboration

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,599
uh do you have within the projects

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,879
you're working with if anyone wants to

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,000
take that feel free

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:12,479
um feel free to just

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,240
answer so we certainly have some tooling

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,840
level

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,240
cross-collaboration where a really big

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,280
example is the open qa service that we

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,120
use that

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,120
came from susa and it's really

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
instrumental to fedora's testing efforts

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
at this point

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,360
um and then we also have some key shared

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,919
code

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,640
like the library that dnf uses to

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,519
actually do its work comes from souza

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
um and then of course we also have a lot

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,839
of interested

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,080
shared upstream projects which we work

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,320
together

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,599
that i think that's yeah we have neil

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,760
and yeah

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
neil does all cross collaboration with

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,279
all projects ever

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,040
and we've got dan so we've got actually

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,880
some um venn diagram

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,839
overlap of people as well which is

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,839
awesome

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,920
yeah and since you mentioned uh since

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,040
you mentioned lip solve

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,880
which is at the heart of lib dnf now

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,640
if i understood it correctly nowadays

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,279
the uh micro uh opensuse micro os which

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
is using

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,839
transactional updates that in turn is

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,040
now using libdnf

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,480
so it's interesting

00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,000
nice earlier this year um

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,160
uh richard brown and i switched opensuse

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,600
micro os for desktops

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,839
uh from using uh the

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
weird shell wrapper thingy calling

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,760
zipper

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,519
to using a lib dnf plug-in

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
that implements the whole transactional

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
updates mechanism

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,880
so that package kit you can use it and

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,480
so gnome software can actually do

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,120
upgrades this way

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,160
as well as plasma discover and any of

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,160
those other

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,920
uh things like that we also have micro

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,120
dnf now able to do

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,800
um transactional updates with butter fs

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,399
and things like that and there's some

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
further development down the pipeline to

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,640
enable it for cockpit

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,000
as well and so that there's some there's

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,440
some fun stuff going on

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
with that and i'm hoping that we will

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
have

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
you know the dnf package manager with

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,560
the transactional updates enablement

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,720
actually used throughout micro os on all

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,760
flavors desktop server

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,120
whatever because it it's actually worked

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,680
out real nice and made for

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,560
a much cleaner experience for

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,200
integrating

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,200
in the stack

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,240
yeah i think we also got some we have

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,040
some

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,160
decent collaboration in the rust

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,200
ecosystem

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,480
as far as i know the fedora rust special

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,360
interest group

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,000
was leveraging the open build service

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
quite a lot

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,480
i guess adrian flinches now

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,600
because i i think it caused quite some

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,000
strain on

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
on the build service in a few at a few

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,760
times but

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,240
uh there's been some some call up in

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,720
there

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,200
as far as i'm aware i think there was a

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,600
bug that some

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,399
resources were not read and taken

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,519
endless but

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:14,399
uh yeah that's got solved that's

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,680
it gave michael some heartburn when uh

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
when we when we started doing the

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,800
dynamic build dependencies at obs

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
because

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,480
uh the processes would get hung and it

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,200
would just kind of stay there

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,200
uh keeping the vms up even after the

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,279
builds were done

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,959
because every time the every time you

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,880
run the build process

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,640
it starts up a brand new virtual machine

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
and runs the whole build process inside

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,279
of there

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,040
but because it didn't know that the

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,519
dynamic build dependencies

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,480
cycle was complete it keep the vm

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,079
running

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,519
doing nothing so i i have a question

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,720
about this at a higher level rust is an

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,160
example but

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,000
basically uh every every language

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,160
especially every new language has its

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,120
own package manager its own way of doing

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,320
things

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,680
and as fedora we've struggled with what

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,959
the best way to

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,639
provide a good experience for users

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,399
both developers who are using those

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,839
languages and then consumers of those

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,959
developers work

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,639
like in our in our world and our

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,040
traditional answer has been you know to

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,639
cram all that through rpm

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
with increasing automation which is

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,600
definitely cramming it all through rpm

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,959
with one

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,959
with automation is definitely one

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,079
approach um there might be other

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,800
approaches to do that um so i guess on

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,560
the rust

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,360
thing in specific um

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
i think people see little value it's

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,519
hard it's hard for us to convince the

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,040
world of the value of putting

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,160
rust crates into rpm format

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,920
um arguably there's value

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,600
but it's a it's an argument that we have

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,959
to continually make if we want to say

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,760
that

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,839
i think that there is almost zero value

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,760
in both the fedora community doing it

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,920
and the opensuse community doing it so

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,600
how could we make it so that it is just

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,200
one community doing that packaging

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,200
we would have to sit down and

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,880
and essentially come up with a way how

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,720
we want to do that

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,680
but there's also there's also a limit to

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
how far we should go since we can't

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,560
package the world

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,120
anymore at least with rust with node.js

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,519
these uh these ecosystems they have

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,240
really small standard libraries

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,040
and they have they have huge dependency

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,760
stacks

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,240
and at a certain point you really come

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,760
down

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,240
to to think

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,440
does packaging everything as rpms does

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,120
that really provide

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,079
additional value it does if you can

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,040
if you can for instance uh so what

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,199
there's been some

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,240
recent development for the in the build

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,440
service

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,000
to provide uh

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
to provide rendering of the of the

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,199
dependencies

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,160
where you can replace certain parts of

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:09,279
them

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,279
with uh with rpms that you ship and

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,399
certain parts that you take from

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,320
upstream

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,040
and there you could say okay we have

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,440
these core libraries where we provide

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,800
support as a distribution or as an

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,880
enterprise

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,000
and then and the rest you can just

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,920
grab from um from

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,360
npm or from from crates io

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,040
but yeah okay

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,399
three different problems from my point

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,399
of view i mean you are right that

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,839
i mean the build part is one problem and

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,040
we could

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,199
automate it or do it in rpms or not rpms

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,560
this is one discussion but the other

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,800
problem is if you

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,399
do it not an app or not in a unified

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,920
format

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,639
then you would need to deal with the

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,519
cost dependency between the rpm world

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,040
and

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,360
ruby gems and python pip and so on so if

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,959
you

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:08,800
update my mysql it has an effect on all

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,800
the other formats and then you need to

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,360
transfer this logic into

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,519
into the update tooling so dnf super and

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,639
so on would need to learn about it

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,600
i mean i think there's no wrong or right

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,839
answer here

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,440
i think we can should work in all

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,000
directions

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,519
uh and evaluate we can't know we can't

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,959
limit people

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,560
to use other formats we can't force

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,160
people to rpms but

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,560
on the other side there is still

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,680
additional value i completely agree

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,959
but what i think comes to the origin of

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,440
the question

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,639
um when working together with packages

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,920
no matter if it's fast or whatever

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,839
i think there is really the big amount

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,120
of our packages we could really maintain

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,560
together

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,399
and i think our tooling is is

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,759
blocking us there at the moment because

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,279
build service is so much

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,399
different than koji and whatever

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,079
copper whatever else you have and

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
that's definitely an area where we

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,920
should

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,519
i mean we don't need to consolidate the

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,680
build tooling we but we

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,519
should maybe consolidate how we maintain

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,320
sources in first place

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,519
so again i think what's also blocking us

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,959
is convention

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,959
so we have really um there's

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,680
really different conventions between

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,320
opensuse and fedora in certain regards

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,240
so in

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:36,000
in rust it's relatively comparable since

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,399
they have a essentially the same

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,639
heritage but if you take a look at

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,160
um if you take a look at python

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,399
packaging it works

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,160
it works kind of differently if you take

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,079
a look at goi i think that's

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,800
completely different if you take a look

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:54,959
at rubygems it's also

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:58,000
quite different also opensuse uses

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,199
uh a fork version of gem2rpm so

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,559
i think to to really

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,039
to to really come to

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,280
share our sources together we'd have to

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,400
all sit together at one table

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:15,360
and decide we are going to do it now

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,679
this way and reduce the reduced

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,559
differences that we have

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,919
so we did this once before about a

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:23,720
decade ago

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,280
where we came together and

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,240
reconsolidated

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,240
um the way that our structures and

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,480
guidelines and our packages were

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,440
i think was 2011 or something like that

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,400
where

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,280
um basically opensuse and fedora

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,360
communities

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
after like was a desktop summit or

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,280
something like that

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,160
where the guidelines were reforked from

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,240
fedora

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,080
to start over the guidelines in open

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,480
sousa and

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,280
things were built off from there what i

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,280
think failed after that effort was

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,520
there was no ongoing communication

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,280
between the two projects to

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,360
to solve problems together so like

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,640
something that when the fedora russ sig

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,320
was being assembled that

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,120
igor rates and i um did together was we

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,679
made sure

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,720
that the stakeholders from the different

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,039
distributions

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,799
that started the project together stayed

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,240
in contact throughout the time that the

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,320
stuff evolved

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,280
and that's something that we probably

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,520
should be doing

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,880
if we want to like make that successful

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,799
this time around

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,400
from a tooling perspective i agree with

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,919
adrian that like

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,080
we don't necessarily need to be like all

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,280
right koji obs smush

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,760
done that's probably one not gonna

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,600
happen

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,960
and and two uh very very difficult

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,280
um but you know we can do things like

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,640
there's experiments going on with

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,360
you know pulling the sources out of obs

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,600
version control system into a disket

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
style system with code.opensouza.org

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,240
which is a packer instance

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,240
like we can we can start and and the obs

00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,679
team has actually started working

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,280
on scm integration with forges

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,799
uh and they're working on packer

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,840
integration that could actually be used

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,160
in this manner

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,720
so we could start leveraging some of the

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,120
same conventions and

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,120
you know blending a little bit of you

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,960
know best practices

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,919
to to try to make this better and

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,440
easier to share between the two two

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,840
projects

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,760
one place that would make sense to me is

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,360
the source get thing that some people in

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,160
fedor and red hat have been working on

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,520
which is

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:36,320
basically maintain the um version

00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,600
the spec file stuff in in an upstream

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,720
repository rather than

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,840
disk it gets you know actual fork of the

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,600
of the upstream source um and then use

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,400
automation to go to disk it

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,080
and then to build from there um it seems

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
like maybe it could be made so the same

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,640
source get tree could then

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,480
go to um seuss's get and

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,760
build system from there but using you

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,799
know the same original

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,760
source that would be a huge win

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,960
yeah i just want to correct a bit uh the

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,640
things about the continuous integration

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,360
support at the moment

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,520
this is not not so

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,760
i mean this has a different purpose but

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,799
we are working also on an

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,720
alternative asset stores so

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,840
such entire projects even can be

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,120
replaced with the git

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,159
so that an external git can be or other

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,480
protocols can be used so that would be

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,440
the vehicle in our case and yes then we

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
put it it

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,960
exactly achieves this and it doesn't

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,320
matter if it's git or

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,320
if we agree on anything else

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,559
it's more important i think that we do

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,720
the sources

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,840
yeah the source hosting together and

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,600
what's for me

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,440
especially important i think is that we

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,320
agree how do we

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,960
validate which sources we can trust what

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,559
is what

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,640
uh how do we trust upstream project and

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,720
so on because i see here the biggest

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,000
value in

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,080
in our aggregations build is yeah that's

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,039
also something we need to deal but the

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,000
really really important and valuable

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,600
work we do is

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,520
is collecting the trust

00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:25,200
um actually that brings to mind another

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,039
uh thing which is license identification

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,640
in packages

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,799
i have no idea what you folks do in susa

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,919
with that um they're spdx

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,039
okay which is um which is excellent

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,960
because we are actually

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:46,400
working on um a project to possibly move

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:48,880
fedora to spdx for our license

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,840
tagging um it's there's there's a lot of

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,159
work to go there

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
um but that means that we could audit

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
everything

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,240
yeah i think that that would would help

00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,679
collaboration there there as well

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,679
yeah and especially we could also

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,960
leverage projects like cable

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:07,120
which is a license that's a

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,720
licensed checker module that runs in the

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,919
open build service

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,679
and it essentially scans all the sources

00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,760
that you throw into a package

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,799
and tries to find out all kinds of

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,240
licenses

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:23,280
it it's pretty good it finds all kinds

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,080
of interesting things so i've

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
about a year ago i've packaged our

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,600
studio

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,360
for opensuse and then through that it

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,559
came into fedora

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,520
and it found a lot of licenses that

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,320
are that upstream bundled and wasn't

00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,159
aware of

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,400
it also found a bunch of stuff that

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,799
upstream still thought they had bundled

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,080
and

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,520
didn't anymore for five years

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:53,360
so what is that tool called apple uh

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,360
kevin c-a-v-i-l

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,080
oh yeah license sticker was the old name

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,720
so something that might be interesting

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
but the bot is still called yeah one

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,039
something that might be interesting

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,200
would be

00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,280
uh if we could get caval deployed in

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,320
fedora infrastructure and then wire up a

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,360
bot

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,200
to do it on packer prs

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,280
and we could also replace the the thing

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,120
that's done in fedora review

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:25,600
with with the with using cavil and see

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,640
like start using it that way and maybe

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,600
yeah

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,200
fedora ci and body and we could also

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,559
share the licensed corpus

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,400
that we use we actually discussed

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,679
we discussed this in dresden a little

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,919
bit matthew

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:45,080
um yeah so red hat has a tool

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,960
called pelk which is used internally

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,120
p-e-l-c

00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,080
that is part of the rel process and it's

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,039
an internal tool

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,919
not a public tool and we've had some

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,039
talks about

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,200
open sourcing this um i feel like

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,400
susa does this and we could collaborate

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,520
might be something

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,559
um we could um

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,840
move towards i saw neil's face of

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,400
there's a tool that exists that i've

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,919
never heard

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,600
heard of before yes

00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,960
what language is it written in out of

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,679
curiosity

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,960
um it's been around for a long time

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,039
so my guess is python but um there's a

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,919
small chance of it being pearl

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,600
right uh i don't actually know i haven't

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,720
actually looked

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,640
pearl so if it so

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,480
we could just merge all the pearls

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,320
excellent yeah

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,919
merge all the pearls is one thing but

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,200
then if it's python then we'll have to

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,679
have a shoot out and figure out which

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,919
code

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,159
is less awful to work with the one

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:49,520
that's not in pearl is the one that's

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,679
lost awful to work with come on

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
and i'm not even wearing my pearl shirt

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,320
today but i have one that i wear all the

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,919
time i love

00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,880
pearl but uh matthew i'm trying to be

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,320
diplomatic here

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,000
powell is not too bad it's really hard

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,000
to like transition though because i

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,520
don't know you know we have we have a

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,559
lot of other things we wouldn't want to

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,080
hit on

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,720
oh yeah sorry i'm gonna

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,159
i'm gonna go to ben here um so and i'm

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,640
gonna read this because i

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,159
couldn't break it up uh so so easily but

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,200
um you know the messages

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,080
really of um collaborating amongst the

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,279
projects

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,000
really resonates um i think we see it as

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,880
as we

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,360
you know we talk about it and so does

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,039
anyone

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,520
well actually ben do you have any

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,320
opinion about why that is

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,039
and um you know what kind of thing you

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,240
just started

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:47,279
with ben ben

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:49,919
yes well he ben said he would do it so

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,440
yeah and you asked if i have an opinion

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,720
which is a funny question to ask

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,840
um you know i think

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,960
you know think about my own experience i

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,080
got started

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,120
contributing to fedora because i had

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,039
been using it

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,640
and like here's this thing that i'm

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,760
getting for free and people are

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,600
you know putting effort into doing and i

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,600
felt sort of in just

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,640
ethical obligation to give back to the

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,400
community

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
and i think that's true to some degree

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,679
for a lot of people who participate in

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,480
open source projects

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,440
and so you know the whole idea is that

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,000
you're putting your

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,960
your code or your documentation or your

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
design or whatever

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,279
out there for everyone else to also use

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,559
and so it's just sort of inherently

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,840
collaborative

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,960
um and because you know there's not

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,679
these strict boundaries

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,440
of yeah you know we have fedora and

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,039
opensuse and ubuntu

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,039
and debian and all these other

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,120
distributions

00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,039
that have some differences but we're all

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,600
using the linux kernel

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,080
you know we're all using the same basic

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,120
uh

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,080
you know user land tools it's like

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,080
there's not this

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,279
strict thing where i'm working in this

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,360
one community and

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:03,039
i'm only going to work here because

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,640
nothing touches like as soon as you

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,679
start working on anything that goes into

00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,679
a distribution

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,520
you're almost certainly impacting other

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,320
distributions and then it starts to make

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,039
sense to

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,039
work together

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:22,320
so dan actually i think you said you

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,760
would probably also

00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,039
good yeah i mean i'm i'm afraid ben

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,120
uh ben already said most of the uh most

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,159
of the important parts since

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,240
if you if you do open source at least in

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,279
my opinion open source

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:42,000
or more or less for me open source is to

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,880
a good extent about the community

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,039
about the people it's not all it's it's

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,200
also about the code and that you can

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,080
that you can modify it but it's also

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
mostly

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,279
about the people with the uh with whom

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,039
you work with

00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,600
and then then it's about collaboration

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,720
and it's kind of wired into the into the

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,840
heart of the whole thing

00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,520
i mean you can you put it out there into

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,760
the public so that people can

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,640
can reuse it and i mean the whole thing

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:16,640
started like that

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:20,000
so it's kind of baked into its genes

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,760
okay well

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
okay so so the benefits uh

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,200
i mean you could see the benefits uh

00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,159
with collaborating

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,840
uh do you have any actually do any of

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,399
you have any specific examples that you

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,399
could think of

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,080
so i guess the earliest example really

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,399
for me

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,840
that i think really demonstrates this

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,960
quite well

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,240
is when i started working on

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:55,279
bringing up support for

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,679
um soft float arm

00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,399
architecture so like the really crappy

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,399
like

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:05,440
useless arm architectures um for dnf and

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,559
and rpm so that involved you know going

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,480
to at the dnf level adding in

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,679
the markers to identify to that but also

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,720
teaching lip solve

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,720
how to do it and going through to that

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,120
which meant touching to both a red hat

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,080
project and an open souza project

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,880
and then going to open build service so

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,559
that it would learn how to actually

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,320
sort that and be able to select the

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,360
correct builders for that as well

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,320
and those sorts of things uh like when i

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:37,200
was doing that architecture bring up for

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,640
a professional project thankfully nobody

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,159
will ever see the light of day of it

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,000
because it was a terrible thing and i

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:45,440
don't ever really want to

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,760
do that again but uh

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,039
but because er because it was something

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,159
that involved some

00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,799
you know different distributions

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,399
different projects i even found you know

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,640
there was a linux distribution that was

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,640
actually shipping

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,840
rpm based distribution with dnf and all

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,880
this stuff

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,279
uh you know for arm v5

00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,399
and they were like yeah you know if you

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,919
can help us out with

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,679
you know getting this all fully working

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,880
with this new stack that'd be great and

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,440
it's like all right

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,520
sure and they tested some of my patches

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,039
and and made sure that it worked and

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
you know so like with a little bit of

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,559
magia's help and

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,279
and you know michael schroeder's help in

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,480
in lib solve and adrian in open build

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,520
service

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,200
uh and um

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,240
and uh yaroslav ron check i'm sorry i

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,720
screwed up that name

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,080
i'm sure i messed that name up in the

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,559
dnf team

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,600
uh it it went fairly well and i was able

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,080
to easily

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,520
like work with a whole bunch of people

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,640
whole bunch of random people

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,399
to get something that was both simple

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,679
and complicated at the same time

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,679
actually done and usable

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,120
and no that's still a terrible

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,159
architecture right

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:06,559
yeah i think uh

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,440
another good example is also is also

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,840
open qa

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,559
which uh was also previously mentioned i

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,200
mean open qa is

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:17,519
relied on by i mean that's the thing

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,600
that makes opensuse a tumbleweed

00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,279
roll and be actually pretty stable for a

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,880
rolling release distribution that

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,600
releases

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,159
up to five times a week if you compare

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,240
that to

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,399
other rolling release distros which

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,799
break break break and break

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:40,000
um that we won't name names no we won't

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:43,519
um but so it's

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,159
uh and a good chunk of that is

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,120
is achieved by open qa and then fedora

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,480
using it

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:53,679
i use uh you see choir you know you see

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,080
especially adam you see especially adam

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,120
contributing to open qa

00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:02,799
also upstream and fixing stuff that's

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:06,640
uh that that sort of

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,880
is used by fedora and

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,880
so i think that's that's one of the

00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,200
that's a pretty good example

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,080
and adam also added something unique to

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,880
the open qa

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,120
ecosystem that i found really handy he

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,320
wrote a python client for open qa so i

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,480
didn't have to write

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,039
code you're not gonna get away from that

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,919
fight we're gonna come back to it

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,519
i figured i just pointed out like adam

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,519
added something that actually made it

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,559
much more usable for a broader set of

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,600
people and that

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,279
that helped me start like you know

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,279
poking at it and testing like whenever

00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,200
i'm working with open qa stuff like

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,840
either in opensuse or fedora

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,799
i use the python open qa client so that

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,559
i can

00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,880
you know automatically go find something

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,080
fetch it and and take a look at stuff

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,320
because

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,600
you know there's a lot of stuff in in

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,240
open qa

00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,440
and and navigating by hand is is very

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,480
very annoying

00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,120
um and if you if you want to uh

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,559
and if we want to go down this python

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,679
versus poll route

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,399
open qa is now also adding uh

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,799
adding a python api so in case you don't

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,120
like

00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,159
perl at all and don't want to use the

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,519
test api you will be able to use the

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,880
uh python based test api soon but

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,960
it looks like i can exactly

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,080
over to python i expect that will happen

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,399
possible but it looks the same so

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,799
sure but it's it's the thought that

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,799
counts

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,150
and then we'll rewrite it in rust

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,380
okay you're banned

00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:44,380
[Music]

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,480
okay it works but if you have a common

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,519
goal and those have advantages of it

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,559
then collaboration works mostly

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,480
automatically in those places

00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,519
it's important to find the common goal

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,519
and to come and benefit

00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,240
yeah that's i think been the hardest

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:06,159
part in general was just

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,840
finding a way to bring everyone to

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,159
realize that there is a common goal

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,000
because

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,200
a lot of times you know people don't

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,720
realize that

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,760
you know they may be framing the problem

00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:15,520
differently in their head or they're

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,200
thinking of it in different terms

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,599
but it's still like the same kind of

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,679
thing and everyone still

00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:22,960
and sharing the workload you know many

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,879
hands make light work

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,879
is you know an old phrase that is still

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:29,839
true even today

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,280
like collaborating makes it a lot easier

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,839
for us to do

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,839
bigger and bigger things together better

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,879
is it in in doing the questions

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:45,520
we had one that a lot of you actually

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:47,760
responded

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,839
to that you would want to answer and one

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,119
was and it kind of is opposite of what

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,159
we're talking about but

00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,839
uh collaboration can sometimes feel like

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,599
a drag on innovation

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:59,599
um because of the required effort to

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,160
communicate and synchronize

00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:05,040
with many different people so how do you

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,040
overcome this feeling

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,920
oh man that one

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,760
that one seems like it speaks to me in

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,599
particular uh

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,400
the the hard part really is

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,400
trying to

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
the the hard part about making the

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,520
collaboration work

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,880
is trying to not necessarily make it

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,400
someone else's problem

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,760
because that's a lot of what sometimes

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,480
that's what a lot of people kind of

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,839
default to

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,240
but trying to find a way to

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:37,440
have everyone see the benefit of solving

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,280
the problem

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,839
uh and the reason i find it important to

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,480
do that

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,200
even though that is pretty grungy and

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,160
and unrewarding work most of the time

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,920
uh is because the end result is i get

00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,119
more people that can help me solve the

00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:55,200
problem better

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,960
because in a lot of time cases if i'm

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,200
doing the thing by myself i'm not a 10x

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,760
engineer i do not i do not have the

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,839
capability to make magic out of nothing

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,320
i am not that good and

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,040
and the only way i'm even halfway

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:15,359
successful on anything that i'm doing

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,359
is because i can get help from others

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,560
who are willing to chip in

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:23,200
and and right that make it successful

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,400
that's the real 10x engineer right there

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,440
the one who can

00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,400
convince 10x engineers to

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
work with them right

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,400
i still feel like a failure after drag

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,040
i mean so it may sound a little

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,160
self-serving but i think

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,240
having somebody you know in that sort of

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,119
act as like a project or program manager

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,839
role

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,359
who their contribution is just managing

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,839
some of the collaboration

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,359
and the communication uh really helps

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,839
you know fedora

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:03,040
didn't have somebody in my role

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,359
originally

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,400
and it was sort of a crazy disaster now

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:11,119
it's like slightly less crazy disaster

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,880
um but i think you know that sort of the

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,520
same principles apply

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,200
when you get into a smaller even sort of

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,480
more ad-hoc collaboration

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,560
is if there's not somebody sort of

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,119
keeping the cats all going in the same

00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,119
direction

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,079
you then do have to communicate with

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,560
each person individually one-on-one and

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:34,000
that

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,440
becomes an unmanageable overhead

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:40,400
i'm gonna echo that for the community

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,400
based work as well

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,440
people are hard

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,359
 me oh come on adrian

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,280
i think you kind of have the hardest job

00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,400
of all you have to make all the things

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
work

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,560
for everyone no no no i have to excuse

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,200
that it's all content all problems are

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,590
only

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,880
it's only the content

00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:08,720
[Laughter]

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,240
i don't know i distinctly remember a

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,720
couple of times where i have to go and

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,839
ask you

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,640
like hey this thing is not working

00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,200
because

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,839
um stuff's missing

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,839
what do you

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,520
my daughter has solved her insect

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,440
problem by deciding to go to the mall

00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:32,960
with her friends

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,640
that's an interesting solution

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,640
solution makes sense honestly

00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:42,880
who among us has never said bugs are

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,880
hard let's go shopping though

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,839
fair

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,640
yeah but i would i think what's what

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,359
really helps

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:57,359
uh helps in terms of collaboration if it

00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,520
feels like a drag is

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,760
to essentially consider if i

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,800
if i push this stuff upstream yes it's

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,359
going to be

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,400
more work in the short term but in the

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,720
long term i get

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,520
more eyes i get more people to look at

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,760
that

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,880
and so in the the long term solution

00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,359
is very likely going to be better so

00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,480
that

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,720
really that really at least helps me

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,440
because i i know i mean sometimes you

00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:29,680
submit a pull request somewhere and then

00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,359
then the discussion starts and then it

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,920
goes around in circles and

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,520
weeks later it's still not merged and at

00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,480
some point you get annoyed and you think

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,359
oh i could just

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,359
fork this thing and be done with it and

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,160
then the project lives for 10 years and

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,720
you think

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,400
oh damn it i should have i i should have

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,960
been maybe a bit more

00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:50,560
resilient and actually go through with

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,000
this pull request

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,480
so i i think the

00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,440
i think in the in the long term usually

00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,640
collaborating

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,079
tends out to work to work out uh

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,440
positively for everyone i have a

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,839
response to this

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,280
for myself personally overcoming that

00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:12,400
feeling it's a lot of

00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,880
adaptation and not being so

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,680
like don't hold on to your idea of what

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,800
the outcome of this is going to be

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,319
let it evolve and kind of accept that

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,440
embrace it

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,079
that's how i go about it at least with

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,720
the

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,400
with the non-coding you know teams

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:36,000
within fedora working amongst

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:39,280
themselves i'd probably say

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,400
coding programming that's the easy part

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,280
that's that's the part that honestly

00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:46,560
does not matter very much most of the

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,960
time

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,119
the actually getting people to sit in a

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,560
room together and not throw pitchforks

00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,440
at each other

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,119
that is the hard part that is from

00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,160
sitting in the room

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,839
oh my goodness yes like that's

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,920
those are the things that really strain

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,119
my desire to do this kind of stuff

00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,319
because it's it's really difficult

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,920
sometimes when you have

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:14,319
really unfortunate personalities

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:16,720
is the way i'm going to describe this

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,359
really unfortunate personalities in the

00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,720
room

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,119
and it makes for and whether it's code

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,480
whether it's documentation whether it's

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,079
whether it's design

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,079
whether it is you know advocacy

00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,400
or any of those things like it really

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:35,760
doesn't matter what space it is

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,400
like juggling you know personalities and

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,160
trying to get people to mesh together

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,079
is really the hard part because when

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,079
that falls apart that is what leads to

00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:46,160
forks that's what leads to

00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:48,000
split efforts that's what leads to

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,880
project failures and things like

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,520
that i i notice you said for both forks

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,520
and pitchforks

00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,359
one of the things that's i mean some of

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,359
its personalities and some of it is

00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,319
people who

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,560
maybe need to learn to work better

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,760
together in collaboration

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,359
but a lot a lot of it is this

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,160
is very personal for so many of us and

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,880
it's very hard to not take the smallest

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,040
things

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,720
very personally very quickly especially

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,839
when you know you it is something where

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,400
you put in

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:27,119
you know 100 hours a week both your your

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,440
work time

00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,800
and your free time and whatever it's

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,599
it's it's been

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,400
your life and your passion and it's very

00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,800
easy for some

00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,400
you know somebody's comment that they

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,240
didn't mean in a certain way that sounds

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,599
dismissive to set you off

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,800
or for you know even things that started

00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,880
as technical to become

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,720
very um just adversarial um and so it is

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,760
it is a hard thing

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,079
to deal with just gonna add that

00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,040
codes of conduct make collaboration

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,000
easier

00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:01,760
it's definitely something we implement

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,480
and use in the fedora community

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,760
to make things easier for folks to work

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,880
together

00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,040
and it's definitely helped i don't know

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,359
if codes of conduct in themselves help

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,400
but having a process to make that code

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,359
of conduct work

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,160
is i think probably more important

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:20,800
because i

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,680
have been involved in a ton of projects

00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,520
that have them

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,000
not naming any particular names but they

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,480
have code of conducts and things like

00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,240
that but with no mechanism

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,520
to make them real to make them

00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,839
enforceable

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:35,599
they're just words on a digital paper

00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,440
they don't mean anything

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,720
like it's it's quite one thing to just

00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,640
say you know we're gonna copy the

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,560
contributor covenant or

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,920
insert your favorite template of a code

00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,520
of conduct here

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,200
it's quite another to say i'm going to

00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,240
back this up with action when somebody

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:50,319
actually

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,000
like points something out and and says

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,319
that this is a problem

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:59,760
and in a lot of open source projects

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,240
and a lot of communities sometimes you

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,440
just have one without the other

00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,880
and that's just it doesn't work it's not

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,400
enough

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,040
you have to mean what you say and say

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,040
what you mean

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,119
can we lighten the mood a little bit

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,160
more and

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,560
we'll we'll talk about it like

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,400
so you know with with collaboration what

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,319
do you all think could be improved

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:30,079
i mean i think we've hit on a few things

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,160
already um for sure

00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:34,640
but um consider anything other things

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,760
that come to mind

00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:38,960
nice things the advantage we have is our

00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,640
distributions

00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,480
are so large and we have so many

00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:46,160
individual pieces

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,960
and in some cases it we won't be able to

00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,960
collaborate also

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,480
the additional time effort to agree on

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,040
something would be way too much

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,720
that it isn't worth it basically but you

00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,040
have so many packages that there are

00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,040
still

00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,839
definitely some stacks where we could

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,119
aim for where we would be should be able

00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:07,280
to work together

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,520
uh i don't know which one to pick first

00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,560
but we

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:14,319
let's say i don't know something rust if

00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,680
you want if you want to this example

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,160
right

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,880
where we have the same pine same pain

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,920
and

00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,079
where you should yeah yeah

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,119
i i looked at a little rust project i

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,760
have that

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:29,359
all it does is it makes a little world

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,400
with trees in it that you can move a

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:34,720
little figure around

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:38,000
this it has 236 dependencies

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,599
um so am i ever going to package that up

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,680
in the traditional manner

00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,400
not if some unless somebody else agrees

00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,520
to package at least 234

00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:51,359
of those dependencies i

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,680
have written a extension for vs code and

00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:56,400
including development dependencies

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,040
it's over one thousand node modules yeah

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:03,200
and i have been conservative

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:06,560
so i'm not packaging those

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,290
no js makes me wanna replace this water

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,880
bottle with something way stronger

00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:13,119
[Laughter]

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,400
yeah but where i definitely see where we

00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:17,440
could collabor

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,440
where we definitely i think

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,920
can collaborate and should collaborate

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:25,599
most for instance not only the packaging

00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,359
stuff but also image building since uh

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,520
that's that's something where

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:32,240
essentially every distribution

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,280
has its own tooling so in the open build

00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,160
service and for

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,440
the opensuse distribution we mostly use

00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,960
kiwi

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,960
um fedora has i think lorax

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,800
okay i wasn't aware that it was so many

00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,839
but essentially

00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,040
kiwi is already a pretty is is a pretty

00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:57,599
powerful tool

00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,800
and it would be great if we could just

00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,800
if we could also

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:06,319
work uh work together on something there

00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,000
since kiwi can build fedora images for

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:11,440
instance it can build ubuntu

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,400
and yeah neil is uh neil is doing his

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,880
thing since he

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,720
brought in a good now we have ten

00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,160
different ways of doing it is what

00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,760
you're saying

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,960
i will aggressively yeah i'm not saying

00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,839
all the other make a tenth

00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,480
that will one rip out all the other ones

00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:28,880
if we replace it with kiwi because i am

00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,040
so

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,160
tired of fixing all of them every time i

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,160
make a change to them

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,880
it's a massive time sink and it sucks

00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,640
and everybody should feel ashamed of how

00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,960
many times i had that this wheel has

00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:46,319
been

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:49,599
spun over and over again

00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:50,880
with square wheels that are chipped at

00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,559
the edges

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,559
with sharp spikes on the sides

00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:59,440
i think another way we can uh improve

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,119
the collaboration

00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,359
is you know we think a lot of our

00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,760
collaboration tends to focus on very

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:07,440
technical things whether it's you know

00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,400
packages or how we're building the

00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,000
process

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,599
i don't know that we necessarily doing a

00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,520
very good job of collaborating on how we

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,160
build our communities

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,119
but you know it's really interesting you

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,040
know i was

00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,640
right before the world shut down last

00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:22,160
year i was at the scale conference and i

00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:24,400
spent about an hour in

00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:25,839
the open sousa booth talking to an

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:27,760
ambassador there

00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,920
and every problem that they said they

00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,200
had like that's very familiar

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,319
and then you know the the opensuse

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:38,880
uh community survey um

00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:40,319
and it was back over the winter maybe

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,240
you know a lot of the problems i was

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:44,400
like oh this is these are the exact same

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,480
problems that we face in fedora

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,800
and i think it'd be great if we had a

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,720
way to um

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,240
work together on those things too right

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,880
because you know

00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,680
like we said the code is not always the

00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,319
uh

00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,960
the hard part and i think there's a lot

00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,880
of benefit

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,400
you know culturally it feels like our

00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,280
our projects are very

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,520
similar we have a lot of shared uh

00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,480
community members so i think we you know

00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:11,119
collaborating on the the community parts

00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,640
is a

00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,720
big area that we haven't really tapped

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,240
yet

00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:21,599
i think an unintentional positive

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,880
of pandemic kova times has been

00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,839
a nice uh chance for our communities to

00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,319
engage

00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:29,520
at a higher level at these virtual

00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:32,880
events

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,920
um and you know nest and the release

00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,680
party we've had

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,359
you know different organizations come

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,760
and hang out with fedora

00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:40,559
you know and this cross-collaboration

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,960
panel

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:44,720
is a great example of like something

00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,000
that maybe wouldn't have necessarily

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,480
happened just this way

00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,200
uh if covet hadn't happened we hadn't

00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:54,240
put more time and energy into virtual

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,280
events and i think it's given

00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:58,000
a different swath of people a chance to

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,040
connect with

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,520
communities that are tangential so we've

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,200
seen

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,440
more engagement and more folks at our

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,160
events and i'm guessing that

00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,960
that is part of it it's definitely not

00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,040
intentional

00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:15,839
it's an observation yeah but

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,520
i like twice again if we have a shared

00:50:15,839 --> 00:50:19,280
community somewhere then they need to

00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,640
have a shared

00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,400
goal because then they can talk about

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,480
the same thing but we would get this if

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,000
we share some components if we would

00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,400
have for example the

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,400
same ground desktop then of course if

00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,920
you speak about gnomes and it doesn't

00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,559
matter if it's user or

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,559
fedora so it would be then the

00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:44,960
yeah i don't know then he would maybe

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:49,520
even need to come name

00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,520
something i don't know susan dora

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,079
fedora is working on a community

00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,680
outreach

00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,079
revamp and uh when that is

00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,599
is all said and done and has a bow on it

00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:04,000
love to share that with

00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:06,079
other communities they can adapt it for

00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,760
their purposes

00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,200
we're planning a resource library you

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,839
know it's gonna

00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,839
it's happening

00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,079
yeah like this is something that i kind

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:22,079
of ran on in my platform to become

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:25,359
a board member was um

00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:26,720
i i personally have felt that the open

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,559
sousa community

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:32,400
lacked a particular um

00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,160
i want to say empowerment to feel like

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,559
they could communicate and collaborate

00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,079
and

00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,000
communicate and and execute on things

00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,680
in in a way where they felt like they

00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,720
could be seen like uh

00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,520
something that was a problem that i had

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,119
observed

00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,920
like listening in the open source of

00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:50,559
discord server in the matrix rooms

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,160
talking to

00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,319
the folks like pretty much everywhere

00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:57,359
outside of the open souza factory irc

00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,440
channel um the common issue was

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,640
you know i i'm trying to figure out how

00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,720
to do something but i can't figure out

00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:05,040
how to figure out how to do something

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:07,200
and when i even if i could figure out

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,200
how to figure out how to do something

00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,040
i don't know how to make people know

00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,839
that i did this thing and like

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,680
maybe look at it or see if i could be

00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:18,960
made better and things like that and

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:22,800
i feel like this is a problem that

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:25,839
spoke to me so very hard and

00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:28,960
um and it's something that

00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,520
uh i'm hoping you know that you know

00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,440
with this

00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,839
closer ties between fedora and open

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,480
souza we can learn a little bit from

00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,319
each other

00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,559
about how to do that sort of thing so

00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:40,319
that our community members can feel

00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,599
empowered to drive

00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:46,319
change excellence and growth in

00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:47,520
in both projects like both fedora and

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:48,720
opensuse

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,960
you know deserve to be able to be

00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,800
successful and and make

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,000
you know the the people that use these

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,359
projects

00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:01,839
to live to work to play

00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,839
to be happy with it to

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:12,240
sounds good such a statement matthew

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:17,359
but um you don't you think that this

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,839
kind of a problem is because

00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,960
we have too many communication channels

00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:25,200
and they are

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:28,319
some of them are just too little um

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:30,640
so uh at least with

00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:32,000
with everything but irc and the mailing

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,480
lists they're all

00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,079
bridged together and unified so when

00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,680
someone talks from one avenue

00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:39,200
the other people every one of the other

00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,559
avenues actually can see each other and

00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,800
respond to each other

00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,079
so it feels a lot more connected than it

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,559
would like say

00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,280
for example if you go into fedora's

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,920
matrix

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,839
discord or telegram rooms they're a lot

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,599
more fragmented because there wasn't an

00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:55,520
intentional approach of connecting them

00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,440
all up front whereas when we were

00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:59,520
introducing the real-time chats across

00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,680
the different platforms in opensuse

00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,599
a distinct goal was making sure they

00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,680
were all connected to each other

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,760
uh it's generally not allowed to

00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,240
introduce a communications platform

00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,119
that is not connected to the other ones

00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:13,680
and so

00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,440
if it's a real-time chat platform where

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,000
users and developers and other folks

00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,319
would be

00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,079
you know communicating with each other

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,559
there needs to be a way to connect them

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,960
all

00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,319
so that nobody is missing from the

00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,760
conversation

00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:29,599
uh and that was something that uh

00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,119
i think alleviates a lot of that problem

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:33,920
at least on the open source side

00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:36,160
the main actual problem has been that we

00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,280
have not been able to connect irc

00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,040
to all the rest of them because of a

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,079
whole bunch of historical

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,960
uh mess with how the irc channels were

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,319
managed

00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:51,040
um with the un unfortunate uh

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,520
situation around irc that has happened

00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,200
um

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,880
it has been an opportunity to actually

00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,319
fix that too so

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,359
like one of the things that i'm i'm

00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:02,559
hoping we can actually resolve

00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:04,880
soon is bringing everybody

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:05,599
um you know into the onto the same page

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,640
so that

00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,760
you know someone who unfortunately is on

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,520
irc

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,799
can talk to everyone who's on discord

00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,359
matrix telegram

00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:16,400
and whatnot and and be able to to do

00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:19,119
that sort of thing

00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,920
um but the second part of it is not just

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:24,240
the real-time chats but like

00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,160
people don't know how to get started to

00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,319
do something in a lot of cases

00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,559
and i don't know the answer to that

00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,880
problem i don't know how to solve

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,720
how to help people like get started with

00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,880
their thing other than case by case

00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,079
things and that doesn't scale

00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,000
so neil we've kind of sort of

00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,040
sort of solved this problem a little bit

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,440
in fedora with the join sig

00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,240
it's a like a group of people it's a

00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,280
chat room

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:54,720
and a repo that's it it's very

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:57,599
like low commitment effort and it's

00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,839
simply a place to send newcomers and the

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:01,680
folks that hang out in that chat room

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,200
help them open a ticket it's like a

00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:04,880
little intro ticket

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,240
trying to like get some information out

00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,280
of them and they connect them

00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,760
with the group that makes sense so

00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,480
it's a big problem we're solving it with

00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,720
people

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:19,920
and it's working pretty well okay cool

00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,920
something to look into then

00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,880
i already know um

00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,400
so it looks like we're sort of hitting

00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,480
that uh

00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:37,440
top of the hour and i think we'll

00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,440
probably um

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:43,839
finish it up is there any last words

00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:46,960
that anyone would like to

00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:46,960
famous last words

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,200
i think neil's uh soliloquy from a few

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,880
minutes ago was an excellent

00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,400
ending point so if you go back to edit

00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,880
this video just stop it there

00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,319
shop it and that that i think that says

00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,799
everything there is to say

00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,599
through a shameless plug everyone's

00:57:04,799 --> 00:57:09,440
invited to

00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:11,760
mass 2021 and open souza will be there

00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,520
so it should be a great time and andrew

00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,200
will give a great talk about obs

00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,040
stuff and how they're supporting fedor

00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:21,040
building fedora on it

00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,640
i mean should we do this panel at nest

00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,559
i think it'd be fun it'd be a different

00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:27,280
it'd be a second audience

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,680
call call for participation still still

00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:31,440
open

00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:35,680
right now it is open until july 16th

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,680
get your proposals in sure

00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:42,640
but yeah like i i'm really happy that we

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,400
did this this is this is really nice and

00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,119
it lets us show like the perspectives

00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,680
from

00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,960
both of our communities and hey adrian

00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:51,440
is here which like i

00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,640
have i barely ever see adrian on

00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,559
anything and

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,079
that just excites me in a whole

00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,040
different level

00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:59,040
it's not my time

00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,480
it's quite late for me it's not against

00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,480
you

00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,839
i know our time zones do not align at

00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:09,839
all

00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,000
all right well i want to thank you all
