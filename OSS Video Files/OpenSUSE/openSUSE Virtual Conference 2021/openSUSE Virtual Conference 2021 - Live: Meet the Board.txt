literally 30 minutes beforehand so

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,840
i don't even have time to do much of

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
anything other than clean up for the

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
meeting

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,919
um but yeah so

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,600
within open souza i'm involved in the

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,360
heroes team running a lot of the

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,880
infrastructure helping with

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,440
improving the quality of our services uh

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,680
so for example opensuse code the packer

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,639
instance we have at code.opensouza.org

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,919

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
and myself run

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,680
um we do a fair bit around you know

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,800
packaging and improving the infra

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,160
for infrastructure and tools um

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,280
in the distribution and i do

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,560
a lot of i want to say

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,240
random but not exactly random like

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,199
a wide variety of of things across the

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,680
entire spectrum of open souza

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,240
from the software stack at the bottom uh

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,319
for software management to

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
graphical desktop tooling and stuff at

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,759
the top

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,360
to try to make the opensuse experience

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,280
the best that it can be

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,280
and try to help engage bring

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
open souza to the wider community

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,280
mindset of the

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,479
of the open source world to make us more

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,759
prominent more visible

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,599
and more um active and engaged

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,039
uh rather than like kind of sitting in a

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,440
corner where

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,720
nobody really hears about us so like

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,880
that that's kind of what i

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
i try to aim and focus on

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,520

like my daughter who's four year olds

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,080
her laptop is it's a microwave laptop

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,399
that you can just install

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
some software five flat packs and she

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,640
cannot do anything else on it

um except for turning it off and on

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,600

yeah that's true thank you gerald uh hi

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,560
i'm axel

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,399
i was just recently re-elected for the

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,600
second term on the board

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,880
um i live in dusseldorf uh

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,519
i have two kids just to pick this up

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,440
where one of the kids still lives with

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,120
me and he just came down preparing a

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,120
sandwich and made me feel angry

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,920
um i'm mostly packaging stuff software

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,040
that i think is useful software that i'm

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,440
using myself

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,600
and i'm more focusing on the desktop

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
side of live so i'm

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
running tumbleweed with the latest kde

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,920
desktop

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,440

i'm open member since

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,279

ago

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,440

only active on the on the mailing list

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
so

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,279
not so much on discord or the forums but

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,640
nevertheless i look into this every now

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,200
and then

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
and in my daily life i work as a

business consultant

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,240

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,600
stuff

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,880
and i kind of joined the board

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,240
in around end of february last

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,519
year as i was

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,399
not elected but appointed to an open

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,839
seat

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,839
and since then i'm observing on the

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
board

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,760
cool um and i realized i didn't

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,760
doc didn't introduce me and i didn't

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,320
introduce myself

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,079
i didn't finish it i i realized now

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,680
after hearing everyone else talk

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,360
i didn't actually say anything else

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,360
about what i do and who i am

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,959
everybody knows gary so he doesn't have

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,800
to introduce himself

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:56,079
okay i'm gerald or jerry or gerald um

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,760
cto at susan and um chair chair of this

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,240
board

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,079
um yeah one thing as a board we have

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,880
been thinking about

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,320
i would say fair bit on and off over

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,440
last months is

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,959
how to improve transparency

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,880
within opensuse um how to you know what

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,519
we from our site can do to

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,600
help improve communications and and one

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,880
of the things we realized is

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,680
is our board meetings um

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,399
might be good might might be a good

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:32,000
approach and so

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,000
12 days ago we started um with public

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,079
board meetings

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
given you know given the time zone

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,440
spread we have between mostly

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,040
simon um emea center

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,800
central emea and um us

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,880
east coast the slot we found is

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,800
pretty much to the only one that works

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,199
without making anyone doing calls at 5

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,199
00 pm or past midnight

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,279
um so unfortunately there's not much

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,560
flexibility there

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,519
but um i was very i was very

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
positively surprised by the first very

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,440
first

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,120
public board meeting we had um it was a

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,800
was a handful of people um

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,880
but it was one of the more

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,959
one i would say of the more productive

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,680
board meetings we had and

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,760
not only was it an opportunity to listen

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,199
we actually got really good interaction

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
got really good input

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,839
and i think the work we have been doing

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,800
and some of the decisions

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,399
um and the conversations actually really

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,600
really benefited from that

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,760
so definitely something where we're

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,079
going to continue

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,360
definitely something we are new to so

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,079
there is

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,519
learning on our side learning on the

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,120
side of the board learning on the side

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,320
of the project so we welcome

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,680
feedback on how to make this more useful

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,920
to you how to

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,639
make this more transparent how to make

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,639
this more open

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,120
and you know we'll make it better over

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,680
time

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,040
and next one an invitation neil is going

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,320
to send out an email

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,920
um soon next one is

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,639
this coming monday 1pm central european

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,959
time

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:25,120
7 a.m um eastern daylight in the us

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,880
and past dinner in australia

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,880
what is it in adelaide simon

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,639
if i press the mute button i can talk um

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:38,880
it's about 8 30.

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:42,639
okay so that's really good

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,000
and one of the things um so that's one

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,560
step we have taken

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,160
and and another step we have we we have

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,240
started to look into and actually

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,320
started to put into action

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,480
is to be to

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,800
to make it easier to submit topics to be

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,519
more transparent on some of the

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,279
most of the items as many as possible

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,560
that the board handles

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:10,240
um just publicly and and for that

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:13,440
neil actually has helped us move towards

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,199
um a cool new system that we are also

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,480
evolving as we go so that's that's

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,240
another project

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,600
that's actually started to deliver

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,079
already but

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
we're we're also happy to receive

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,839
feedback

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,800
and yeah neil can you go into that a

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,320
little bit and introduce folks to that

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,240
yeah sure so um

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,920
so as i said when i was introducing

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,800
myself one of the things that i wanted

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,440
to do was

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,160
you know make open souza more visible

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,480
and

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,480
not and and that also includes two

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,600
people in open sousa

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,600
and uh something

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,800
as that had also dovetailed into my

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,440
setting up the

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,240
um the new code forge that we have for

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
people to use

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,759
to develop free software projects within

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,199
the open souza

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,040
project um i thought that it'd be a

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,160
great idea to start using that so that

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,480
we can give people

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,280
an easy way to to you know talk to us

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,319
about things that are not sensitive uh

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,959
so that we can

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,039
you know not only do asynchronous

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,079
communication that is easily tracked and

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,799
so we don't have to remember

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,400
it in our heads which is was before

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,240
before this was actually a problem like

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,559
we had to remember what we were going to

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,039
do

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,000
and figure out all that stuff now we

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,720
have you know

00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,799
something that we can refer to but also

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
because i wanted to make it so that

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,840
we didn't have to come up with what we

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,679
needed to talk about

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,840
as a group i wanted to make sure that

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,200
the community could also be

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,919
involved in this process as well and so

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
if you go to code.opensouza.org board

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,360
slash tickets

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,240
you can see that we have a uh repo there

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,919
with an issues tab where you can file an

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,880
issue about something that

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,960
you would like some uh feedback from the

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,240
board on and this may not necessarily

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
turn into something that requires a

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,640
meeting

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
but it certainly will turn into

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,080
something where we can discuss this with

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,679
the community

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,080
in a structured uh more visible form

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
and if it does require a meeting like if

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,480
it's something that we can't resolve in

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,360
the ticket

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,880
out of the gate then we will mark it to

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,559
be something for a meeting

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
and in our next public board meeting

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,480
we'll talk about it and the

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
it's a very simple process up front i

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
wanted to keep it super lightweight so

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,760
that

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,039
you know because we're learning and

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
we're figuring out how we want to do

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,600
this

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
and as that evolves we can implement

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,720
more structures as needed or do more

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,320
separations or whatever

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,320
but i wanted to keep this i wanted the

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,600
on-ramp to be very very

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,320
simple and i'm hoping what this does is

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,320
it makes it

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,039
you know more clear what the board

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:57,840
actually does what they can and can't do

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,840
and how we go about doing what we can do

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
so i'm not sure if you can read the chat

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,679
there neil but lubos said you should

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,440
mention

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,039
mention feature requests moving there as

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,960
well oh yeah so

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,240
uh no i can't read the chat because i'm

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
on another computer and

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,400
venulis is a is an annoying platform

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,440
that requires a token to

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,760
log in every time uh but

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,679
uh and i don't have the token on this

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,120
computer

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,440
but um

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,679
yeah so something that came up during

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,600
the open source elite 15.3 development

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,679
and i got hit with all the edge cases so

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,039
like i felt particularly unpaid from

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,840
this was

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,600
um it was pretty hard to coordinate and

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,400
figure out like what we needed to do

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,720
and i was fortunate enough to be in a

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,520
semi-privileged position to be able to

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,440
interface with you know lovely sousa

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,760
folks about it but

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,640
that like i me being the only one

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,120
doesn't scale

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
and and the system that they're using

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,160
makes it

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,280
um really difficult for everyone else to

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,440
do it too

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,679
and so i've been talking to lubos for a

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,039
few weeks now about the idea of

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,200
leveraging the same process that we've

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,640
been using for

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,840
for the board to actually adapt that

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,960
to do the same kind of feature request

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,799
handling

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:21,039
for opensuse elite for 15.4 because

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,120
while it might be small up front what i

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,720
actually honestly expect that as we can

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,799
develop this process

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,720
to help the community be more engaged in

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,559
the development of opensuse elite

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,559
both sli and leap will benefit and there

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
will also just be more stuff

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,080
after a certain point a wiki page is

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,360
just not going to not going to work

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:41,200
and uh and like when you need to track

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,520
feedback and iterations on what's going

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,679
on

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,640
and syncing things back and forth forth

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,000
between susa

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,360
internal and uh and the and

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,440
the public community and making sure

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,600
everyone is on the same page

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,919
um lubush and i agreed that it it'd be a

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,720
good idea to try this for 15.4 so i set

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,840
up

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,159
um code.opensuse.org leap

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,840
features as a repository for

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,280
for doing exactly that people can file

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
feature requests about things that they

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,080
need whether it's for sleep

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,679
or leap and then lubush and i

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,840
along with other release managers will

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,720
make determinations based on whether it

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,000
needs

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,480
susa involvement for sleek components

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,120
and we will you know follow up and make

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,799
sure that

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,960
the community is supported to make their

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,799
their things that they want to do and

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,080
provide an opensuse elite

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,960
possible we want to help make opensuse

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,960
elite the best

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,000
quality stable long-term supported

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,400
enterprise linux class distribution

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,400
out there

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,260
with the latest and greatest kd of

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,600
course

00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:55,919
[Laughter]

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,360
i was going to i was going to look how

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,720
this is going to end

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,600
like dramatic pause yeah that's a long

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,600
word

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,000
i had i was trying to come up with a

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,840
word that describes exactly how i feel

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
about open souza leap and it turns out

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,480
there isn't just one

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,080
and so i i just went with all of them

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,919
you got the link you got the link the

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,440
wrong way around it's actually

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,240
late slash features ah i thought i said

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,640
code

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,960
slash leap features for everyone else

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:28,000
the link is already in the chat

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,000
oh good sorry i can't like just paste or

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,919
type things because again wrong computer

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and and venueless is dumb and does not

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,000
let me just use login credentials or sso

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,960
um that's why you use synergy to copy

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,559
and paste it between your computers

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,080
if i had thought about that before i

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,679
joined into this i probably would have

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:47,200
set that up thank you simon i will

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,799
remember that but the next time

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,400
i am doing something like this again

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,760
between two computers on a virtual

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
platform that doesn't let me log in

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,840
between two different computers with the

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,000
same credentials

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,520
talking about which one of the one of

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
the roles the port has

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,880
um has to deal with and that's not part

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,960
of the public

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,440
meetings is conflict resolution

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,280
thank you thank you one of the other

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,559
things the board is also very good at

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,600
is going off topic and being sidetracked

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,360
and driving a chairman nuts yeah it's

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,000
not that you would ever see any of that

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,400
here

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,799
um and and so um

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
one of the one of the thoughts ideas

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,840
that has come up

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,039
that we have been working on a little

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,159
and i'll i'll

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:38,320
refer to hiatan and simon is

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:41,679
um moderation consistent moderation of

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,679
across online channels

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,840
yeah um

00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,039
[Music]

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,440
one of the things we concluded was that

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:54,640
there was a pretty

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,919
big discrepancy between

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:03,840
uh for example the mailing lists

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:04,550
the forums and our other online channels

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,080
um

00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:08,320
[Music]

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,559
don't want to go into details that much

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,480
but one thing i can say is that the

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,480
complaints that the board received were

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,559
missed mostly about the mailing list so

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,919
we started talking about

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:24,480
moderating them and

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:28,000
uh we actually did

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,480
and i think we haven't done it long

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,159
enough to

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,200
define some proper uh result

00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,039
of it but i think that

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,679
uh our guiding principles our tnc

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,840
they should be across the community when

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,840
we agree that to that housing board

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:56,320
simon and to add to that to also

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,080
help with the consistency and for a bit

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,720
of accountability

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,000
so that the board has an understanding

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,880
of what goes on

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,400
what we're looking at implementing i'll

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,000
say looking at because we discussed it

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,840
last meeting

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,080
and we haven't exactly figured it all

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,520
out yet and we have plenty of people to

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,080
talk to about that

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,679
is getting everyone who's moderating a

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,200
platform

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,559
together in the same space whether

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:26,000
that's a forums or discord or rc

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,559
or mailing lists um so that we can all

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,840
share

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,320
information about who's being moderated

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:36,000
um partly so that the board has an idea

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:40,400
of how many people we're moderating

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,360
over a year other than obvious spam

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,080
and so we can see any discrepancies and

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,520
partly

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,520
it'll help us detect any issues that

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,559
might arise if

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,000
we can see that someone's never had any

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,279
action taken on

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,559
the platform i moderate but neil has

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,080
already given them three warnings on

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,080
some other platform

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,360
then that's useful information for us to

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
be able to share

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,320
as a group of moderators so if you

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,600
moderate a platform

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,360
look forward to us getting in touch with

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,000
you about that

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,960
at some point soon once we figure it out

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,520
yeah exactly

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,360
and like this is also somewhat

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:21,919
consistent with the strategy

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,799
that as a project that we're trying to

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,440
have

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:30,480
which is uh we we want to make sure that

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,480
regardless of which platform that you're

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,760
communicating with the community on

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,440
whether it's

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,000
matrix discord telegram or irc

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,720
um from the real-time perspective or

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,799
forums

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,240
or the mailing list from an asynchronous

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,000
perspective

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,279
we want to make sure that those are

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
relatively unified

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,400
and consistent so that you know people

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,320
who are

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,440
you know talking to each other there is

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,039
no divide that makes it difficult for

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,799
for people to follow along with what's

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,880
going on and

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,080
you know in the real time chats this is

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,679
this is being also

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,679
handled by um unifi

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,799
like bridging all of the communications

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,799
channels together

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,400
now this is not complete this is this is

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,559
still in progress

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,320
um because we literally just got our

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,640
matrix server working like

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,840
a couple of weeks ago uh and

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,600
and we're trying to make sure that um

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
at least in the real time side we want

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,360
to make sure that if you're on

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,360
if you're on matrix you can talk to

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,799
someone who's on discord

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,039
who can talk to someone who's on

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,880
telegram without having to be in all

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,960
three places at the same time

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,799
and this is also something that this

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,880
unified uh

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,480
moderation stuff that we haven't quite

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,520
figured out how to do yet

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,240
is supposed to help keep the uh you know

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,399
keep things

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,760
uh um according to our code of conduct

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,320
and our guiding principles

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,360
and the way that we want you know we

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,880
want people to

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,000
be uh friendly and awesome

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,640
and have a lot of fun being part of the

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
project

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,919
and being part of the community

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,000
and when i say we will figure it out the

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,520
way means not just the board but

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,360
some of the moderators as well most

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,760
likely yeah

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,000
it's not just us because like that this

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,760
is not an idea of being like totally top

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,840
down on here we are

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,120
before we even started considering this

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,399
we engaged with the

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,440
with some of the moderators from the

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,120
various platforms to figure out

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,799
you know what is even feasible and

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,279
whether the idea is even good

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,960
and the reason we're even moving forward

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:41,120
this because they told us that this

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,440
actually would be helpful for them to

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,919
to make it you know better and make the

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,840
experience better and

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,399
we just we want this to be a nice place

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,399
to be in

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,480
yeah especially because we all think

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,480
that

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,399
well i personally had complaints from

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,840
people being treated rude

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,720
and uh it means that

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,000
you we are losing users in such such

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:11,039
cases

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,840
and in a friendly environment uh

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,520
these new users that feel at home that

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,360
feel comfortable

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:23,919
uh they will pull in their friends

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,120
they will um they will pull in

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,559
their friends and that's growth um

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,320
especially these young people they're

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,520
the future of of

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,159
of open source and souza yeah

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,559
and and those people who become excited

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,080
and

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,480
love the community and love the project

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,440
they they want to learn how to make it

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,600
better

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,240
and they become contributors yep that's

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,360
how i started

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,039
i was just going to say in a rare

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,120
occurrence people in the chat think

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,880
you're actually too quiet

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,880
wait what i'm too quiet

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,799
volume not quantity

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,480
all right as you as you can tell we

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,440
actually do manage to have some fun on

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,320
the board

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
i mean there is

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,480
loads of friendly choking usually going

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,799
on in the meetings and

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,200
neil said it and i really want to

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,720
emphasize actually i just looked it up

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,000
to make sure i quote it properly um

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,520
we want to have a lot of fun is is

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,279
and that's a literal quote from our

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,039
guiding principles

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:35,120
and another one is we are working

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,080
together in a friendly manner

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,480
and i'm sure in most cases there is no

00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,080
bad intentions

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,080
but i've also seen the guiding

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,679
principles sometimes used like as a

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,640
weapon and

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,279
um for me the guiding principles should

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,039
stand

00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:56,080
for something and obviously

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,919
if you stand for you need to

00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,320
you need to push back on some things you

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:03,440
need to defend the freedom you need to

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,080
need to defend the safe space

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,880
that you have but i think sometimes you

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,799
know

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,919
smiling thinking is this really so

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,360
important or

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,240
is there another way of

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,799
of looking at this then my way or the

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,360
way i have right now um is a really good

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,039
thing and

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,279
unfortunately in the tool i don't see

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,360
whether he is on but

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,360
last year i had lots of conversations

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,960
with with christian and i can

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,080
christian polls and i can tell you um

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,279
christian is not something anyone can

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,799
convince easily

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,799
if he has a position and i'm not someone

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,240
you can convince easily if he has a firm

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,200
position

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,159
but what i really appreciate it and what

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:52,159
i found really valuable is having this

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:54,480
interest and interest to listen

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,399
and and understand and then you know

00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,640
maybe take a step back and say you know

00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,799
what i

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,519
i still think this shade of green is

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:05,279
nicer but i can't understand why you

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,799
why you want that shade of green and how

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,440
can we

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,440
how can we put that together and you

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,519
know do something that's checkers

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,760
or on mondays we wear this shade and on

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,679
tuesday we wear that shade

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,360
or frankly and that has happened and

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,000
that's what i really because that's not

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,960
easy

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,720
that's what i really appreciated in to

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,640
use that example

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,080
um conversation sometimes you realize

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,360
you're wrong and say you know that

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,360
wasn't i missed something

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,760
and the reason i'm mentioning this is

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,919
interestingly enough

00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,840
the conflict resolution in the last two

00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,880
years has actually shifted a bit on the

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,080
board

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,200
um initially it was mostly meaningless

00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,880
hence english addressing this but in

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,799
in the last months i say we started

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,440
getting about one

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,799
fits like once a month complain some

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,080
code contributions

00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:01,000
you know on between reviewer

00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,679
and contributor or between

00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,200
co-maintainers or so

00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,120
and there we don't have a good approach

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,559
yet so

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,000
um let's see how that involves

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,679
you know i'm not i'm hoping it's not the

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,399
beginning of a trend

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,799
and i'm not hoping this is like a wave

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,120
um

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,640
but if if any of you has interest and

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,559
skills

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:27,840
to see how we can actually put in place

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,200
in a group of people um

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:35,360
or something a process

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,760
to help navigate and and mediate

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,279
and that might be one of the things that

00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,880
we will have to face

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:46,000
um as a group soon yeah something that

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,760
about that particular topic i think you

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,720
know personally speaking i think that

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,960
one of the reasons why we're seeing this

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,000
is because

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,080
as we i think to some extent they were

00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,120
kind of always there

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,840
um but it was more

00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,320
of which ones were louder and which ones

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,359
were more

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,679
of a problem as we

00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,200
have started solving these problems and

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,560
started working with

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,879
you know the other members in our

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,560
community to make

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,839
sustainable solutions um

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,520
handling this stuff uh the frequency of

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,599
this stuff has gone down

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:30,079
this is this makes me so happy the

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,520
frequency of the stuff that comes to us

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,599
has gone way down and

00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,639
and the and we're we're able to tackle

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,359
some of the other

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:41,760
aspects of this too you know in in some

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,720
respects we've never fully implemented

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,839
our guiding principles uh in a way that

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,960
makes it

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,159
um consistent and understandable to the

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,720
community

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,679
uh when it comes to how we should work

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,280
with each other and

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,280
and that sort of thing and

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,400
getting to that point where you know

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,440
with this

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,560
with this year of doom uh caused by

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,000
a you know a worldwide pandemic and i

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,839
think it's just amplified that

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,560
particular gap that we've had

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,160
and now that we have been solving it

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,680
things are starting to get better i've

00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,839
noticed in the

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,800
in a number of chats in a number of

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,920
spaces that

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,520
um people are

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,520
happier again like communicating with

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:30,240
each other and using and and

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,680
starting to want to contribute to open

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,760
souza

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:39,040
and that is making me very happy

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,880
because i didn't i never liked seeing

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,720
people leave because

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:48,640
they felt like they were um

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,640
not able to be heard or not able to

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,720
feel welcome or any of those sorts of

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,560
things and

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,920
so yeah i i don't have any more

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,800
structured thoughts on this

00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,839
hey um i just want to like you kind of

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,680
hit on it neil

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,200
um you know ben actually asked the

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,440
question you know

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,280
has have you seen more an increase in

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,880
the code of conduct and you you kind of

00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,839
like definitely hit onto that

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,119
um so i just want to point out some of

00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,680
the questions i know they're being

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,000
answered

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,079
uh but i thought attila brought up a

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,760
really interesting one with

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,160
that kind of relates to our panel

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,839
yesterday which was um

00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,760
you know interconnecting all the

00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,800
communication channels

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,560
the newer aspect of mediating

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,880
it you know the trolls tend to

00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:37,440
move out pretty quick and they reappear

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,440
somewhere else

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,320
so something that has been an

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,920
interesting side effect of bridging

00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,359
um the real-time chats and unifying the

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,880
moderation control

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:53,920
across matrix telegram and discord

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,240
was that we don't get people who try

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,920
attempting to evade our bands anymore

00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,599
because as soon as they try they get

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,960
whacked again anyway

00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,079
and so um people who act

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,520
um dishonorably in

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,440
in the in any of the chats just

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,359
they get pushed out fairly quickly and

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
it it it avoids

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,880
it it makes it so that there it's not a

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,440
problem uh

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,520
and in general that has actually changed

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,040
the balance of people who come in

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,079
like it used to be that um

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,440
we'd get people coming in um

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,720
saying frankly stupid things uh

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,920
and stuff that's deliberately troll-ish

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,640
or or whatever uh and then they would

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,440
just

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,560
hide in a corner you know pretend to be

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,410
nice a little bit and then

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,599
do it again later and

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,839
[Music]

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:49,520
be in another platform so they would

00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,000
evade one platform jump to another and

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,880
then come

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,320
back and then and that sort of thing uh

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,040
with the real-time chats nobody does

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,680
that anymore

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,800
because yeah because they can't it

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,960
doesn't work

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,000
we know that they're them we know what's

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,560
happening

00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,760
and and it gets it gets shut down very

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,920
quickly so

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:13,760
even though attacks are basically dead

00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:17,520
to adnail uh over time

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:20,480
we have uh gotten together

00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,920
a pretty nice team of admins moderators

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,680
etc

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,400
uh all over the world so

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,440
there's pretty pretty basically always

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,119
someone there

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:35,359
that can moderate moderate yeah i think

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,640
the only platform where we have a a true

00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:40,480
gap here

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,240
is irc and and that's been complicated

00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,560
by recent events that

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,960
has made this difficult and simon you're

00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,960
muted

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,800
i was gonna say in some ways the recent

00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,119
events have actually fixed it

00:38:52,800 --> 00:39:00,240
that's true and we now do we now do have

00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:03,200
a better spread of moderators

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,960
because i'm now one in the time zones

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,359
where no one else is awake

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,640
right yeah the the spammers on irc

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:16,079
that show up at midnight

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,520
my time where there's no coverage is

00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:23,520
uh now covered by simon

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,119
so lucky me um

00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,359
maybe people are also getting happier

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,839
now with um covert being over

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,359
or that's that's also like getting over

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,320
and some are coming and stuff

00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,079
for them i don't know oh that could

00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,000
absolutely be a factor like

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,920
yeah uh when you're it's winter and

00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,839
rainy here

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,839
yeah like i'm sweating now

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,640
i don't i don't think it has anything to

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,680
do with

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,119
it um no i meant like the lockdowns

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,240
people being locked up and getting

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,359
annoyed with

00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,960
not being able to go anywhere

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:03,680
yeah it makes to answer

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,960
to answer payne's question have you seen

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,240
an increase and how

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,400
have we dealt with it maybe before

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,760
um before we covered the last topic we

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,480
had prepared and then

00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,280
completely opened up um yeah we have

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,400
seen that

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,480
and i mean but

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,319
and i'm not arg i'm not claiming there's

00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,000
a causal relationship

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,440
there is a very clear temporal

00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,359
relationship

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:32,240
um i'm often accused as being

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,160
as airing on the side of softness i'm

00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,599
usually trying to balance

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:40,079
and and mediate but there was one

00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,119
board meeting end of last last year

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,480
where i

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,240
essentially i think i started the

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,359
meeting and say okay

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,400
everyone enough is enough we need to

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,599
take some

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,280
we need to take strong action um

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,040
and that may have been the one board

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,640
meeting where most

00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,440
warnings and moderations etc

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,960
uh were more issued than i think than

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,960
the year before

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,000
maine still wasn't a huge number but i

00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:09,280
think

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,599
maybe sometimes becoming i mean

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,560
becoming a little stricter and sending a

00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,640
signal

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,640
um can help

00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,760
yeah and maybe to add one word when

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,079
we're having conflicts and we're trying

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,359
to

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,040
to moderate we try to hear both sides

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:29,280
and then talk to the people

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,880
try to get a moderated discussion

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:34,000
between the individuals

00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,599
involved unfortunately we found out that

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,040
this is not working in all cases because

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:44,880
sometimes people just refuse to talk

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,839
and if somebody from the community has

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,440
an idea how we can cope with that i

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,400
think that would be

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,480
would be very much welcome as well right

00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,440
because i mean we can only hear

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,720
help if the people are willing to listen

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,160
to the other one

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,720
and to pick the information up and

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,720
to think about the own behavior but if

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,359
they're completely rejecting

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,839
to talk and saying hey this is my stake

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,000
my

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,000
my point and i'm not moving

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,839
what do we do

00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,000
with that pause um i don't think we

00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,960
really mentioned but go ahead and

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,440
if you have questions um please put them

00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,160
in the

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:35,920
in the chat uh on stage one

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:37,520
[Music]

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,560
and we and now i don't really know how

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,280
to bridge but

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,319
continue on girl continue on i can just

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,720
start talking

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,800
let's end on let's end on a happy note

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:51,520
which is budget

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,520
yeah money

00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,359
maybe we can take one thing along

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:04,160
as a last subject because ben

00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:07,359
asks lubos asks to

00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:12,079
us to talk about collaboration with

00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,240
other distrust

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,440
it's just moderated towards seeds to

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,440
talk about budget

00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,720
yeah which was the last thing would be

00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,720
every day

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,400
let's let's have sids talk about budget

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,760
and then okay you mentioned

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,920
you mentioned christiano already

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:33,520
one more thing oh boy

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,560
and then another three subjects no

00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:40,240
go ahead go ahead general no

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,119
see it's sits at the stage so um

00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:44,240
like i i started the board or i joined

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,160
the board because um

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,440
i wanted to help as a treasurer and to

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,119
actually help um

00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,040
like with the financials with the

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,160
financial side of the project

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,599
mainly as well because of um like i

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,040
figured something with a foundation

00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,720
would be a good idea and

00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,720
with the foundation it's probably also

00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,280
very useful to have someone that

00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,640
like has some sense of actual like

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,000
financial statements

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:09,760
of uh reporting of tax filings and stuff

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,359
um but that's not the only thing that a

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,240
treasurer draws of course because

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:15,760
like everything else just continues um

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,520
that was there before like the the

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,640
travel support program

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,599
um last year we didn't really have any

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,440
travel support

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,280
so that was kind of easy for me to start

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,920
with um

00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,160
and starting also as a liaison sort of

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,560
between susan and open souza

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:34,960
um i've been trying to um to talk to

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,560
people to i've spoken to andrew about he

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,160
was doing um

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,280
i've spoken to a few more people like

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,599
doug and i'm just trying to get a sense

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,760
of

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,200
everything that is happening financially

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,920
um with the project

00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:49,280
and how sort of opensuse and souza are

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,319
intertwined

00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,359
and what we can actually sort of start

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,839
to do

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,400
to even make a foundation if that's like

00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,599
actually

00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,079
financially possible um so that's sort

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:04,560
of what i've been doing

00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,520
and that's what i wanted to say about it

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,480
i don't know if anyone

00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,800
has any questions about it in a few

00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,800
minutes

00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,040
okay cool um so

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,079
before we go further we had a half item

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,520
on the topic

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,000
and someone's asked a question about the

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,680
foundation so

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,800
i guess that means i get to talk to it

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,359
talk about it um

00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,800
basically the status on the foundation

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,240
is

00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,040
not much has changed since we

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,480
made the proposal at the conference

00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:43,200
several years ago

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,880
as people would be well aware season

00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,640
management has completely changed a

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,160
couple of times

00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:54,960
and so we're basically at the point

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:58,400
where we need some people to sit down

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,400
and write a business case

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,880
to a large extent financially about

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,800
what we need how it will save susan

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,319
money which it should do

00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,400
and stuff like that so we can start to

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,960
present that to the new seizures of

00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,839
management

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,160
and make a really compelling case that

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,400
is

00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:20,800
something i'm happy to work on at some

00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,280
point when i get time

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,400
i don't know quite when that is yet

00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,839
hopefully soon

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,520
but if others would like to work on that

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,440
as well

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,440
get in touch and see what we can do

00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,240
you meant probably others outside the

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,640
the board because we have already

00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,640
started and prepared a basic

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,920
presentation about it and

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:47,119
just just thinking loud

00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,880
um if we're not moving forward with the

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,760
foundation which needs

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,480
a certain involvement of zoos as well

00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:55,520
maybe it's an

00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,520
idea to start with a kind of supporting

00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:02,720
organization uh what do i know the

00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,359
the geeko association or something like

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:06,640
that

00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:08,079
which is dedicated to support the open

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,040
source project

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,400
but it's not a foundation in that case

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,599
but could be

00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,520
um a much lighter thing

00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,599
many schools in germany have these kind

00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,599
of supporting associations

00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,280
so when your kids enter the school they

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,119
ask you won't you join this

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:27,359
this association and they're collecting

00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:28,559
money and giving this to the schools to

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,640
buy stuff

00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,079
uh that they are not able from the from

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,880
the budget that they're getting from the

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,960
government

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,119
yeah and that's that's also kind of a

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,000
thing in in the united states as well

00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,000
there's a

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,520
specific class of charities that is

00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,280
designed for

00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,200
clubs and associations to be able to

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:48,240
handle that sort of thing

00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:50,000
my my personal opinion about about

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,079
having a foundation or a charity

00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,280
organization supporting it or

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,559
owning the opensuse project is i

00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,760
really would like for us to

00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,559
behave more like we are that way

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,160
before we actually are because that's a

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,240
lot easier it's a lot

00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,680
less dangerous to make mistakes when you

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,160
don't have

00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,599
that legal structure underneath you up

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,280
front like

00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,800
and i want to make sure we have those

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,680
practices developed

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,400
and and things like that before we make

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,720
that jump

00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,359
because i don't want to get that wrong

00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,319
so before we did our last

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,760
foundation related proposal probably a

00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,920
year before that which would have been

00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,960
before

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,160
i think everyone other than nerfed was

00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,680
on the board

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,599
we did look at that and the conclusion

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,680
we came to was

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,280
it wasn't really feasible in that

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,960
capacity

00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,119
and we should either pursue a

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,119
full-fledged foundation

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:55,330
or we're not going to get benefits that

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,469
outweigh the risks

00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:58,469
[Music]

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,599
we changed it we shifted the the focus a

00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,880
little bit the idea at that point was

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,160
to build an ev in anger fine as we call

00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:11,760
it in germany

00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,839
and to transfer all the uh

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,079
the the trademark and everything to this

00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,000
this was before that we looked at the

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,920
idea you just proposed as well

00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,200
would have been before you're on the

00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,520
board

00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,079
regardless that's probably maybe future

00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,079
discussions anyway

00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,920
of what mechanism of implementing a

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:36,319
legal structure for the opensuse project

00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,760
i personally am not comfortable with the

00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,920
idea of doing so

00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,640
until we've done practice rounds where

00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:44,800
we actually behave like we have one

00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,559
before we actually have one like it was

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,760
important that we got sid

00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,640
on the board and actually you know our

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,400
treasurer and

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,920
and actually participating as a

00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,400
non-voting board member

00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,280
to me because it means that we are at

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,240
least

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,160
more closely getting set up to be able

00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,119
to handle things properly before we

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,160
actually have to

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:06,960
so one of the um key things that's

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,359
always come up

00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,359
in this discussion is it's great that we

00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:14,000
now have sids but

00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:15,119
if in 10 years time we don't have sids

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,960
and we're not doing our

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,480
reporting then the

00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,160
legal fines we could get for not meeting

00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:23,920
our reporting uh

00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,280
would be enough to completely sync the

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,400
project

00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,920
and so one thing that we've always

00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:33,119
maintained strongly in our previous

00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,240
proposals is that we would like

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,839
souza to help sponsor open caesar by

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,359
means of helping to cover some of that

00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:41,839
paperwork

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,359
in which case it becomes a non-issue for

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,640
anyone we have a guarantee that we're

00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,839
going to meet

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,359
our legal reporting requirements because

00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:50,880
caesar would provide resources to do

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,280
that and that's

00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,880
obviously one of the things that if we

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,119
come up with any sort of business case

00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,760
for a foundation

00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,359
we need to be showing that there is

00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,240
large benefits to a foundation that

00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:06,240
offset

00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:08,079
that cost and that cost would

00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,160
and one of the things we looked at with

00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,760
the smaller organizations

00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,040
is even though smaller organizations

00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:18,640
require some level of paperwork

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:21,119
and would inherently have that risk yeah

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:22,960
that's right we're probably as gerald

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,520
would say we're probably

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,760
now discussing detailed semantics of

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,520
stuff that's

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,400
doesn't need to be discussed in detail

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,000
in a board meeting at this point

00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,160
which is the other thing we do along

00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,000
with getting sidetracked all the time

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:39,520
yeah we get into the details far more

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,400
than we probably should which

00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:44,000
makes yeah that is quickly yeah at least

00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,359
we stopped taking three-hour meetings

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,800
for a one-hour time slot

00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:51,280
so there's there's that so speaking of

00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,000
running over time just to let you know

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,640
oh we can continue is we're not over

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,680
time

00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:58,880
but continue as long as uh the next

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,160
speaker comes in

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,079
so can continue as long as you want

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,839
i was i was going to suggest that maybe

00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:08,640
this is a good time

00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:10,000
for us to move into the q a stage to

00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,599
make it easier for anyone else who wants

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,760
to ask us questions

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:15,520
i can't see anything else popping up in

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,119
the chat

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,720
mentioned that someone had actually

00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,280
asked for us to talk about

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:25,040
a collaboration topic earlier so i guess

00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:29,599
that would be good to start back up with

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:29,599
so what was the topic in particular don

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:37,520
let me read up the question ben asked

00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:41,839
he you uh lubus asked

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:44,480
uh by the way one thing that i forgot to

00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:46,640
uh gerald when he was asking for topics

00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,000
was collab with other distributions

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:53,440
ben started district leaders.club

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:58,079
which i think is a pretty cool idea

00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:01,599
what's your thoughts uh

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:03,359
i've been doing a lot of hanging around

00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:07,200
with fedora guys that

00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:11,760
sort of happened thanks to neil

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:15,440
um but

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:18,400
i found that uh you know we discuss

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,680
issues a lot in in the bar and on the

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,880
chat channels

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,839
uh issues that both communities meet

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,040
and it we also think that from a

00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:30,800
perspective

00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,839
that we have in our guiding principles

00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:38,480
why not be nice to other distributions

00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:41,440
and cooperate well i have teams on both

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,839
both sides working on the same upstream

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,839
bug

00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,480
if we could find a way and it will take

00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,000
time to go

00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:55,680
get more coordinated i know

00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,680
there's uh the policy

00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:04,000
political issue that it would be

00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:08,079
also susa and red hat cooperating

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,359
maybe but the thought

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:14,480
why do the work all over again

00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:18,400
and cooperate we can learn

00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:25,200
from in my opinion their

00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:28,079
uh their organizational structure

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,520
and the people from fedora admit that we

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:33,440
have a lot of tools

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:35,280
uh that they could learn from

00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,839
that we do stuff in a way that they

00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,839
could do better

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,839
so

00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,559
so i guess i could say that in my role

00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,359
as part of caesar i see that in some

00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:52,400
areas we do do this

00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:53,040
really well already but also on the

00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,480
caesar

00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,880
side especially with regards to security

00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:58,880
issues

00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,520
we do a good job of working with other

00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,040
distros to have fixes for

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,640
for issues before you even know there

00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,480
are issues

00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,040
so in that sp in that space where the

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,960
collaboration is most important

00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,400
there already is a lot but there are

00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,160
certainly plenty of other places where

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,599
we can learn

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:20,240
or as i'm not sure if it's an australian

00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,480
i'd

00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,480
australian saying but we should

00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,040
definitely be shamelessly stealing ideas

00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:27,680
from

00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,640
other people it's an american saying as

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:31,680
well

00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:35,760
for sure good ideas

00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:38,720
yeah yeah um

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,839
yeah i think it's it i i think this

00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,160
collaboration

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,200
actually happens already and i'm i love

00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,880
to see that

00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,359
and it's at different levels in some

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:50,480
cases it's one person

00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:51,280
who who's you know one foot here one

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,520
foot there

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,480
i mean ben if you ever meet i'll ask you

00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,079
whether

00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,000
whether neil when he talks with you

00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:01,119
starts every third question with

00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:02,400
in opensuse we do um because that

00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,799
sometimes

00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,240
sometimes there's a run where he says in

00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,559
fedora we do

00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,160
um but it's good because that's actually

00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:12,640
breaching that sharing hey

00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,839
i've seen this here and it works i mean

00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:18,160
the other way so often

00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:18,160
i have my fedora hat for such cases

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,880
yeah learning if you look there's posts

00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,119
on the fedora mailing list i

00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,000
mentioned open souza a lot i mentioned

00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:31,599
it it comes up a lot where i i

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,079
basically hammer like some of our

00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,839
tooling and processes around this stuff

00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,000
just kind of sucks and these problems

00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:40,640
are very well solved in open souza

00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,040
why can't we do stuff like it there here

00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,839
because

00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:45,440
it's just i'm spoiled now i don't want

00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,680
to have to do the crap work

00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:51,119
all the time anymore um

00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,680
like it doesn't work and opens too so

00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:57,839
fix it now please

00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:02,000
um so i think it's it's it's the area

00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:04,880
cross um and are you know have

00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,079
anchors feet roots in in more than one

00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:09,200
community

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,400
um other models i've seen work very

00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,040
nicely

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,079
is i know that from the tool chain

00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,160
people because i mean

00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:17,440
i've been engaging in gcc for like a

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,559
long time

00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,839
it's just for the red and green or blue

00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,200
and green

00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:28,000
um people to work together so

00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:29,760
i mean one does the suicide one does the

00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,240
fedora

00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,359
fedora side and you know using the new

00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:37,760
version of gcc

00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:39,599
and 229 packages break

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,920
but sitting here and sitting there you

00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,240
work together right and you don't care

00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:45,760
it's just we work on together on the

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,839
joint project

00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,880
and there's at the project level and so

00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,799
one thing that i've

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,480
at first when i because i was not

00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:55,200
involved

00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,720
so i can't take any credit as much as

00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,280
this is something to

00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,640
really take credit and give kudos to

00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:03,760
whoever did

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,480
is there is the mutual sponsoring um

00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,319
and this relationship that that fedora

00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,760
and opensuse have right

00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:12,079
i mean that's the first time so i was

00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:15,200
like this is isn't this a little

00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:17,760
odd and then actually no because

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:19,680
there is so much commonality and i don't

00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,599
know i mean doug is instrumental i'm

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,640
sure or has been in that

00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:28,640
and he's amazing keeping that and that's

00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:31,040
you know this thinking a little out of

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,280
out of the box and out of like this is

00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,799
my territory and everyone else go

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:40,960
away that goes that goes great length

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:43,200
um and yeah i'm totally open let's do

00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,559
let's do more of that i it's nice to

00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,480
have this identity right

00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,720
in a relationship in a partnership

00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,599
whatever doesn't mean you become the

00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,119
other

00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,359
um there is things that that fedora will

00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:56,720
that will be differentiate fedora

00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,720
positively and

00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,839
hopefully there are things that will

00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,280
will keep to

00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:04,240
differentiate opensuse positively and

00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,280
and that's fine

00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:10,160
mascot that's uh we have a cool mascot

00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:12,480
there is no mascot for fedora sadly

00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,359
despite everyone's best efforts we have

00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:16,559
a cool thing

00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:19,200
they don't and then have this i think

00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,079
they have this friendly competition

00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,240
where

00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,760
you have differentiation and but you

00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:25,200
also you know when you see something

00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,599
works well

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:34,000
um work together um and i think this

00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:37,440
together and apart in a in a

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
in a constructive manner i mean that's

00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,400
great

00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:41,520
that that is really that is really i

00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:45,440
think

00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:48,480
one of the strong points of open source

00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:49,520
uh one of the good things about the two

00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,359
communities for

00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:56,000
fedora and opensuse is that

00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,280
uh i've met quite some people from

00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,200
fedora and i don't

00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:04,240
join their release party etc

01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:07,200
and i never met one single person that

01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,920
objected against neil being a board

01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,720
member of

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,720
open souza

01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,920
not one single so apparently

01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,680
nobody cares i've seen that differently

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,240
in other communities

01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,760
so have i oh my gosh you know it's not

01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,680
just fedor and open suicide

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,880
i mean another i'm in a number of other

01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,480
distributions

01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:33,920
like open souza have a level

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,839
of cooperation and friendliness that

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:37,200
i have not experienced in other

01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:39,760
communities

01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:41,680
and that has made it has made it a lot

01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,280
easier for me to bring

01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:45,040
all the interesting things that i come

01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:46,400
up with regardless of where it starts

01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,200
from whether it's in fedora or open

01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,400
souza

01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:52,160
and bring it to both uh and in other

01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,520
places it's

01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:56,559
more difficult and it's and and it makes

01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,680
me sad

01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:01,040
sometimes because you know at the end of

01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,240
the day what we're trying to do

01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:07,440
is to promote free software and to and

01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:08,799
and to make it the default choice

01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:10,240
whether you're

01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:12,079
you're just working whether you're

01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:16,079
playing whether you're living

01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:17,440
whether you whatever you're doing and

01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,359
in order to make free software

01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,480
successful

01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:25,920
we've got to we have to work together to

01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,359
produce the best free software and

01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:29,200
i don't know how else we would do it

01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:31,040
unless we like

01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:32,799
certainly there's going to be some

01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,319
duplicative effort but

01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,240
that effort can actually be useful

01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:37,760
because some of the other perspectives

01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,839
can see some of the other paths that are

01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,520
being tried to see whether they work or

01:01:39,839 --> 01:01:44,079
they don't and eventually

01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:44,799
we can resolve to come in to a common

01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,480
path

01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:48,400
but being able to experiment to be able

01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,079
to try these different paths

01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,440
and then see where they fail and where

01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:54,079
they succeed

01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,799
is ultimately how we can also help in in

01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,799
collaboration

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,480
um real quick thing i i wanted to go to

01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,520
patrick i know

01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,880
i know uh simon you've been responding

01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:11,119
a bit to patrick's um comments in there

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,640
it it he does bring up a valid point and

01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:15,520
you do as well like

01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,960
you there is a system in place to like

01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,280
keep the knowledge

01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,200
and share the knowledge but you know

01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,920
what what's the succession plan i think

01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,559
that could be

01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,760
probably something that could be part of

01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:29,119
the elections

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:32,839
um something to list but

01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:35,119
yeah i mean i guess i can talk on that

01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:36,640
slightly because i already answered in

01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:38,880
chat so i want to hear what i

01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,319
said in chat people aren't reading it

01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,280
one of the

01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:46,079
one of the questions was how do we train

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:50,400
new board members and

01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:52,880
so as part of the design of the board

01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,359
is outlined in our election rules

01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,880
everyone has two terms

01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,480
and after their two terms they have to

01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:03,119
have a break

01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,039
which means that we always end up with a

01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,480
some older more experienced people such

01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:08,319
as myself

01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,400
sitting on the board alongside some new

01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:13,440
people such as neil

01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,280
but we have particularly when gerald

01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,119
joined because

01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,599
when gerald joined we discovered that

01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:22,240
richard is the previous chairperson

01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:23,680
also held a lot of that knowledge and

01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,359
previous boards probably hadn't done the

01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:29,440
best at writing that down

01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:31,839
so garrett is helpful has hopefully

01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,280
started to create a wiki page with such

01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,200
knowledge and important information to

01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:38,880
make that process easier

01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:41,839
but probably around election

01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,799
time we could do a better job of

01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:46,079
explaining

01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:49,520
what the actual role on the board is

01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:52,079
and what we're mostly doing so that we

01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,760
help get the best candidates

01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:57,039
which at times certain people have tried

01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,240
to do

01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,520
if someone there have been times when

01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:04,480
people have

01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,680
run for the board on a campaign of i

01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,799
want to achieve this

01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,240
this and this for the community and

01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:12,480
this and that and people have been able

01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:14,799
to say well

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,480
that's generally not what the role of

01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:20,799
the board is

01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,319
we more focus on this and that

01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:24,240
but i think it's probably something we

01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:27,359
can communicate better

01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:29,200
leading into elections what our

01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,480
role is and what we're doing most of the

01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:32,240
time

01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,680
i would say something like what is the

01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:37,280
succession plan or

01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:40,559
something to that effect um you know as

01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:42,480
art to be addressed you know

01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,799
um as a common thing that could go

01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,520
forward

01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,520
if you understand that

01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,839
yeah now that we have a new system

01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,680
i can go and create a ticket about that

01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:59,039
and we'll discuss it

01:04:55,680 --> 01:05:00,960
further at another meeting yeah and

01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:02,480
the the new system has a couple of other

01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,440
features that we might use for this

01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,480
purpose like

01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,400
it can host uh static websites that can

01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:11,599
be managed through pull requests

01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,200
to update content uh in a fashion that

01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,920
makes it easier to review and stuff like

01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,440
that

01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:17,440
none of that is set up yet because

01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:21,039
nobody's actually asked for it

01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,319
so far but um some of the stuff that we

01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,760
do as the member of the board where

01:05:22,319 --> 01:05:25,680
we're like

01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,039
you know we we we have new information

01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:28,880
we want to you know

01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,640
cumulatively update that while also

01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,680
maintaining all the history and

01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,359
authorship and being able to see

01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,799
you know what and why and all those

01:05:35,359 --> 01:05:38,319
things

01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:39,920
and also just having a more consistent

01:05:38,319 --> 01:05:40,720
discoverable place to find all this

01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,200
stuff

01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:44,000
like some of the issues that we had is

01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,559
some of it that

01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,200
richard did in fact document but we

01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,400
couldn't

01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:54,799
find it because finding

01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:58,400
where it was as

01:05:54,799 --> 01:06:01,839
wikis are hard wikis are very hard

01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:04,640
so some of this is also gonna i think

01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:06,400
we'll we'll try to bring it together

01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,880
into a more discoverable place maybe

01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:08,880
it's just

01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:10,640
markdown files in the board repo that we

01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,480
have maybe it'll be a

01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,079
a doc site or something like that that

01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,160
we that we have

01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:18,000
set in the in the board project or

01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:19,680
something i don't know yet but

01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,799
there's a couple of options of like how

01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,680
do we want to make this a little bit

01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,680
more discoverable

01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:29,280
anyway we now have a ticket for that

01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:29,280
it's in all the chats

01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:38,079
i guess maybe

01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,000
something that would be useful in that

01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,799
take it is if

01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,960
you see us talking about this and you

01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:47,119
think you could possibly like to be a

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,359
candidate in the next election and

01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:51,920
there's stuff you're not sure about

01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:54,160
add stuff to the tickets so that we know

01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:55,839
to help us know what to address

01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:57,359
goodness knows that i was confused when

01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:59,359
i started do it when i started trying to

01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:02,160
figure out what i'm supposed to do

01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:04,240
i think simon and i had a couple of

01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:05,680
hours of conversation about this before

01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,440
i even like

01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:09,680
you know threw up my candidacy because i

01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,799
just didn't know what i would be

01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,799
what i could even do

01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:19,920
that's probably yes and

01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:21,760
on that point also feel free to just ask

01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,200
current members of the board we're

01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:26,559
mostly a friendly bunch

01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:29,440
we mostly don't buy it i'll mostly talk

01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:33,520
to you about it in a reasonable way

01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:37,599
qualifier we mostly mock each other

01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,440
and not people that come to us

01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:43,839
yeah that's like simon does on

01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:43,839
apparently a regular basis to me

01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:51,119
yeah i should mention richard actually

01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:54,160
did it

01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:57,520
hand over a fair bit of

01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:00,319
of knowledge and information to me um

01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:00,799
so he put uh he put great effort into

01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:04,559
that

01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:07,359
um which which was very valuable

01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,359
i think it's the

01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:14,079
sometimes it was the easy things that um

01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:14,720
you know the the more day-to-day things

01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:16,480
that

01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:19,120
nobody thinks about because you're on

01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:21,040
the board for for a couple of years

01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:24,319
and everything for you is very natural

01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:27,440
that this is

01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:30,000
this is how we do it right um and so

01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:32,880
some of those i had to

01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,400
um i had to discover and i'm sure and

01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:36,080
and that's a natural process for

01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:36,560
everyone in the new role i mean that

01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,719
just

01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,960
is natural for every every new board

01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,000
member and it would always be but how

01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,960
can we make it

01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,960
more i mean how yeah how can we

01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:52,159
succession

01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,719
how can we document things so even some

01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:57,520
of the easier you know how do you

01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,920
just we change the board meaning the

01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,080
time of the board meeting how do we

01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,199
how do we change the reminder email

01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,839
because there is actually a rather

01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:08,960
clever system

01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:10,480
um and it's um and

01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,400
i think one of the heroes probably

01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,239
christian helped me with that and once

01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,239
you know it it's easy

01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:17,600
um but if you if there is an email you

01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:18,839
get and you don't know where it's coming

01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,839
from

01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:23,839
then um

01:09:21,839 --> 01:09:26,400
but many boards have struggled many

01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:26,400
times with that

01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,960
now it's documented i document it and

01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,560
now it's really simple

01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,480
so it's that kind of thing i mean and

01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,239
not that's not that's not critical for

01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,480
the open souza project but

01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:40,319
yeah really some of the best practices

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:44,319
um

01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:45,920
and and it's more transparent for others

01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,960
so i think it's good to onboard new

01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,960
board members

01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:50,640
it increases transparency which is a

01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:52,640
good thing

01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,560
by itself and and also if you if you

01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:56,159
write it down that's actually something

01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,080
then you can work with

01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:59,840
because maybe you realize or a new board

01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,600
realizes we want to handle it

01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:04,320
differently

01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:06,880
but if it's if it's written then it's

01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,960
something that's more tangible

01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,880
um and then then you can explicitly

01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:13,120
tackle that so

01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:13,120
um

01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:26,560
we have to thank simon first uh

01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,560
he needs to go to bed yeah

01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,480
you just yeah i'll go to bed eventually

01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,120
not quite yet

01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:35,920
but okay sometime in the next 10 or 15

01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,239
minutes

01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,239
okay

01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:45,600
do we have any any questions left not

01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,960
sure i think so

01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:48,960
what's your time now simon

01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,679
it doesn't look like any questions

01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:55,760
that's a great question it's 10 past 11

01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,760
at

01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:02,880
so night the time that your kids would

01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:06,320
now go out right

01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:10,080
here they're not quite old enough yet

01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:12,719
but i do have to get up at six

01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:14,239

what are you doing on sunday at six

01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:22,080
i mean going for a run could be one

01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,120
thing at least at our temperatures at

01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,320
the moment

01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:29,440

no i'm getting up and operating some

01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:35,199
cameras for a church

01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,199

01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,960
to

01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:46,159
close out at least some portions um one

01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,199

and

01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,440

01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:04,880
uh in

01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:07,280
one big thing that's like happening here

01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,360
and is the video team and they're doing

01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,400
incredible work and they do every year

01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,960
um so

01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,800
you know a lot of appreciation goes out

01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,440

01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,400
explicitly mention the video team i

01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:30,239
think there is

01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,600
we have volunteers that help moderate

01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:34,880
the sessions

01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,679
so beyond those special specific cases i

01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:37,920
mentioned it's just

01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:40,080
amazing there's a lot of work going in

01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:42,560
an event like this and i mean

01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,400
doc you know because you're the guy who

01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,440
actually

01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:50,239
pulls and holds it together

01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,960
um talking about succession plan or

01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,960
backup plan

01:12:53,040 --> 01:13:00,880

i'm sensing

01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,920
