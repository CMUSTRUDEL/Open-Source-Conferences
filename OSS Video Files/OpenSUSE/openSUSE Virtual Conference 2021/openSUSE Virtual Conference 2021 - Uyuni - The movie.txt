Where are we and what's next

Brief introduction to Uyuni from the user point of view (how Uyuni helps in your day to day), rather than from the product features point of view.

Uyuni is a software-defined infrastructure and configuration management solution. You can use it to bootstrap physical servers, deploy and update packages and patches -even with content lifecycle management features- create VMs for virtualization and cloud, builds container images, tracks what runs on your Kubernetes clusters, CVE audit your machines and containers, etc. All using Salt under the hood. Starting with Uyuni 2021.05, Ansible is also supported.
