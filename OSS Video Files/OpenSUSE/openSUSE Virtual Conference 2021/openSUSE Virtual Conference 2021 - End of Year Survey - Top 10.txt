The things we learned from the survey

The End of Year Survey provided us great insight to users of openSUSE and how they view the project. We will give a Top 10 view about the things we learned from the survey and will provide a summary on how we are proceeding.

joining us

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,640
to do uh go over the end-of-year survey

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,880
talk that we have here we're going to

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,400
list 10 top things that we learned about

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,720
the survey that we

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,920
finished toward the beginning of the

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,640
year

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,400
very good results that we had and a lot

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,760
of good feedback and

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,440
we'll go over a few things that we

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
learned from that here

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,000
a little bit about myself i'm douglas

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,040
demaio i do the pr and marketing for

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,120
the open souza project um

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,640
i also helped to run the conference that

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,120
we're enjoying this weekend

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,440
so we hope hope you have a good time

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,520
i'll be doing this talk with adrian

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,840
and i'm adrian i've been around with

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,879
open souza for about

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,879
one year i would say

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,799
my background is in the academia um

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,080
and in open source i'm mostly buzzy

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,680
writing the docs

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,280
and trying to coordinate on um

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,720
contents and yeah i came up with the

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
idea of

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,360
organizing a survey too you had to

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,479
better understand the community

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,119
last autumn and i was lucky enough to to

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,920
meet

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:30,799
a dog uh who seem to appreciate the id

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,479
here's the agenda for today we've

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,000
already gone over some things about

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,560
ourselves

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,200
so why do we want community-wide surveys

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,119
well easy

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,960
because we want to connect offer and

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840
demand that's the first goal

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,840
we want to make sure

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,280
that developers package maintainers do

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,880
not work for nothing

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,360
we want to make sure that what they do

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,360
is appreciate it and on the other hand

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,640
want to make sure that the users get

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,000
what they want

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,759
and get their feedback

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,719
across the the second reason

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,319
is we want to make contribution

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,360
opportunities more visible

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,239
so we are a big community with a lot of

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
interrelated parts a lot of sub projects

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,360
groups

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,040
etc and we want to make sure that

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,160
people onboarding um

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,280
can find easily the the best

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,040
areas where they contribution would be

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,800
valued

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,400
um the third reason is positioning um

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,760
that is more um tied to

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
the promotional aspect of the

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,200
distribution in the project

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,840
but the idea is that it's not always

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,519
easy for people to identify exactly why

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,879
they would need

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,360
an open-source distribution

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,879
and it's difficult to get past the

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,840
slogan

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,640
like leap is a better ubuntu or

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
tumblrweed is a safer arc

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,319
even though there's a grain of truth in

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,680
that um

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
it's not a message that speaks to

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
everyone

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,239
and also it's a message that we want to

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,239
perhaps

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,360
enrich with more concrete

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,920
advantages and the fourth reason is of

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,159
course

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,400
it's fun to make surveys you make the

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,040
survey you work with people

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
you have meetings and then you design

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,319
the survey

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
and then you release it and you talk

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,200
about it

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:42,480
later and it's a nice occasion to

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,400
to meet and greet last year for example

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,360
it was quite nicely

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,360
coupled with

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,239
the elections so as long as the two

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
things do not

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,159
i mean as long as they play nice with

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,680
one another um

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,519
it's it's really fun and it's really

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,360
something that uh

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,360
you can people can look forward to

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
and if you don't believe me when i tell

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,480
you we are a big

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,239
community of many interrelated parts um

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,280
i'll ask you to just

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:21,440
take a take a quick look at this um

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,680
beautiful graph i've prepared

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,639
some months ago for something totally

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,320
unrelated but

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:32,400
it was nice to be able to re

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,680
to recycle it here um

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,880
and yeah so if you look perhaps just at

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,080
the

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,880
right hand side branch which is labeled

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,120
um

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,240
opensuse as contribution centers

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:53,440
you see that we have a lot of

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,759
places where people can potentially find

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,240
opportunities for contributing we have

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,520
the distributions per se

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,840
tumbleweeds micro sleep the packages

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,520
the security team maintenance and

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,120
delivery

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,560
you have people working on

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,800
virtualization

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,520
you have the heroes working on the

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
infrastructure

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:22,080
and you have other sister projects

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:24,320
such as oyuni yast and kiwi

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,520
all the people working on the contents

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,880
uh translation

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,560
translators um technical documentation

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,320
writers

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,320
people doing promotion in the news

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,960
and you have also the of course the

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,120
governance aspect so

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,120
yeah a very buzzing nest

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,880
so even though this picture is beautiful

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
and nice

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,199
um it means certain challenges

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,400
we have to be up to

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,639
um and the first challenge as far as

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,440
connecting offer and demand

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,960
on that picture is that you have many

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,520
many different things

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,160
and these things change and they changed

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,440
often

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,880
and especially and have been changing

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,360
a lot recently so and this is mostly

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,120
about

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,160
tumbleweed most significant and freaking

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,960
changes are about the desktop

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,720
environments

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:28,319
so the plasma workspace um

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,560
is is a volcano it's

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:36,000
shipping many many releases um

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,120
in in very short time windows

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,479
um we have also changes that are a bit

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
more calm but

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,639
still they're very significant for users

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,400
in the language

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:52,720
stacks such as node python

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,720
you have changes in the defaults

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:59,840
of the distributions and you have also

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:03,360
more magnetic changes in the just2

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,520
especially as in installer

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,960
and the recent changes for instance

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:16,240
that you all have in mind would be

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:19,440
the jump from from leap 15.22.3

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,400
um the change the upgrades to the gcc

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,400
compiler

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,280
the user merge um and the adoption of of

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,360
pipe wire

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:32,720
as the main og pipe

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,840
in in tumbleweed and these things

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,360
i i can't stress this not enough these

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
things are very

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
a very significant change they change

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,319
the way

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,039
people use their software they change

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,319
the dependencies of their software

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,879
they change the buttons that they have

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,639
to click

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,960
in their interface so the takeaway from

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,479
this

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,440
is that it begs for a harmonious

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
two-way communication between developers

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,479
packages

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:09,599
and users to make sure that these change

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,599
are more benefiting that than harmful

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
so the expression harmony through

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,560
fairness is

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,120
something that's dear to my heart

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
perhaps it's it's a little bit overdone

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,720
and

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,919
philosophical but who has um i think

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,199
there's a grain of truth

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:31,120
that is worth capturing here

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,080
um so in a nutshell of the ideas like

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,599
this

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,800
someone said i want to tell you who

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,560
open souza is a dual crescent uh

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,480
in the sense that doing things

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:50,320
gives you power and and makes you

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,600
exert power and the answer to this that

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,920
immediately comes to mind is sure but

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,920
who's to decide what changes happen

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,640
and the idea is that a democracy works

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,760
when upstream the developers is

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,200
considerate

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,640
with downstream the end users and vice

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,399
versa

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,240
and when the the end users reward

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,000
the developers with constructive

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,120
feedback

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,839
actionable preferences back reports

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
contribution

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,320
so this is the idea is that there is you

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,120
need we need to have a balance

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,800
in power and the balance can only be

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,240
achieved

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:42,240
if we give the users the means

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,040
to express themselves in a way that is

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:51,200
actually actionable

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:55,120
and that's the idea of a survey

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:59,600
so the takeaway of the last survey

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,760
i would say is knowledge transfer

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,160
and external visibility that is

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,720
visibility from outside

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:12,000
our own ecosystem are lacking

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,760
in other words if we take the survey at

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,040
face value

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,839
we have to acknowledge divide many users

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,480
are experienced with either linux or

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,839
open source distributions but

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:29,200
as as almost as many users struggle

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,920
with the basics so

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,519
a natural fix would be work on knowledge

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,399
transfer

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,160
through support documentation sprint

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,079
sessions

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,200
mentorship and ideally

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,120
the way we would do this would be a way

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,920
that builds on knowledge that people

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
might already have from other operating

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,600
systems

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,600
since many of them are switches

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,640
so that's that's one thing and the the

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,760
second thing is

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,360
promotion is lacking in the sense that

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,959
open source is not perceived

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,160
well enough outside of its own ecosystem

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,240
and here again the fix is

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,480
the fact that we organize a survey gives

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,320
us some visibility because

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,640
people are interested in it they take

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,880
part in it they talk about it

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,920
and it echoes back to the

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:27,680
to the big cave that is uh

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,440
the internet and it gets us um

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,440
some attention and some awareness

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,079
so you might think okay but if if that's

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,480
true we

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,959
we need to collect these data and to

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,279
funnel it back to them

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,640
to them package maintainers and

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,680
developers

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,240
um why don't we just use the platforms

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,200
we have

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,959
we have so many platforms why don't we

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,639
take advantage of them

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,079
and that's part of the problem we have

00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,279
so many of them that it's quite

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:03,440
fragmented and not only that but also

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:06,639
um the the way people

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,519
visit the platforms is not really

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,800
helpful

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:16,160
for collecting uh actionable data

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,600
what i mean by this is that okay if you

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,959
look at this graph the mailing list

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:26,880
and the and matrix

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:30,000
are the main centers that attract

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:34,399
uh producers people that

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,200
that make or ship software

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
while most of the users especially the

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,560
new users

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
and the prospective users that is the

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
users who have not yet installed an open

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,560
system distribution but

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,279
are intending or are interested in doing

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
so

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,240
are not at all on the mailing lists or

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,639
on matrix

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,320
they are on discord they are on telegram

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,480
they are on reddit

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
um so there is like this a symmetry

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,800
between

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,480
where people looking for image

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,120
information are and where people who

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,560
have this

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,040
information are and that's a gap we want

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,519
to

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,920
to be able to bridge with with the

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
survey

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,839
it is time for the top 10 so we're going

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
to install

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:26,560
install results and ask zipper to

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:31,040
echo the top 10. so number 10 majority

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,079
were unaware of opensuse on mobile

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,120
number nine the issue of perception no

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,440
longer running

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
promotional visibility as mentioned

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,720
earlier

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,800
number eight the majority of users were

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,800
working as it professionals

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,120
number seven the survey time frame

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,720
needed to expand

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:55,760
uh which we plan on doing in the next uh

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,839
release of the next uh survey uh number

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,120
six a large majority of the users were

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,120
using plasma

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,440
um and that was it that was a

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,040
significantly large amount

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,000
uh number five two main groups were

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,800
experienced in

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,040
newcomers number four knowledge transfer

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,160
is an area we need to focus on

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,079
number three people

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,079
are extremely interested in the survey

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,120
results uh that that

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,199
you know there was a lot of good

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
feedback and a lot of interest that we

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,240
saw

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,240
uh number two uh we need better handling

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,120
of our questions which we pointed out

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,120
number one fighting the open souza

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,680
identity crisis

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
so doing that to plan for the next

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,760
survey

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:46,240
so again and

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,240
the takeaway from these graphs is that

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
we have mostly switchers that make up

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,959
the bulk

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,519
of the community people that have been

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,680
trying

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,040
other linux distributions as well as

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,160
windows

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:03,360
um and and these experienced

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,680
people can be broken

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
down into two groups they're really

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,279
experienced people

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,000
uh people that have 10 years of

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,360
experience

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,480
under their belt that would be the left

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:20,480
darkish side of the

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:23,199
of the round graph at the bottom right

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,480
um and on the other on the other hand

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:30,240
you have

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:34,160
less experienced people accounting for

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,199
a significant yet a minority of all the

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,240
older users um and we will see that

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,399
it's not trivial to accommodate

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,399
these these two groups

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,160
so what's interesting here is that even

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,160
though we have

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:55,839
a significant portion of our users um

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,199
who are experienced in linux um

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:04,079
almost half of them do not have either

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:07,440
a university degree or are working in it

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:11,839
that rules out the typical profile of

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:14,959
being a devops or being a cis admin

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,560
and i think

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,639
it's not pushing it to say that it

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,720
reflects on the fact that people

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,320
still struggle with the basics and

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,279
that's definitely our fault

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,880
and we have to improve on that and the

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,160
basics

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,440
being in that case documentation

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,880
installing software finding software

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:42,320
etc the the three big

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:46,079
um spikes um that occur

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:50,639
on this on this graph so

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:53,920
probably one thing we need to do is um

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,199
while while building on the experience

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:00,639
and knowledge of people who have um

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,959
skills in it or in linux

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,240
we also have to make sure that the

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:08,400
there's no

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,199
um there's no thresholds that is too

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,520
too high to cross for less experienced

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,520
people

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,720
so to wrap up with them this question of

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,919
profiling your typical open source user

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:29,360
who is then not just devops or

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,480
sys admin um

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,960
again there is this narrative that

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,679
onboarding is difficult and that's

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,679
that's to take away from from this slide

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:42,480
onboarding is difficult in the sense

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:47,200
that if you look at the left hand side

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:50,960
graph documentation is found

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,480
difficult to search

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,760
and to find so there's definitely

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,760
something we can improve on here

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:06,240
and as for the left-hand side graph um

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,240
people find it difficult to

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,240
acquire more responsibilities

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,039
so things work more or less but it's

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,720
difficult

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:20,720
for people to to scale um

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,200
and to to contribute to

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,240
a more significant more significant

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,440
level

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,919
um and and and to

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,320
to bring uh their experience further

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
um and also another theme that we will

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,240
um

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,880
talk a bit more about later is that

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,960
people are

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,960
are aware that open source is not talked

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,799
about sufficiently

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:51,280
by the the influencers it's not promoted

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,280
and mentioned and

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,840
it's not present enough on the

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,840
on the on the scene um

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,039
on the on the different different social

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,760
platforms

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,640
and and the broadcasts made by different

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,360
influencers

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:15,520
so that's another thing um along with

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,520
onboarding that we can work on

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:24,480
so the takeaway of the last survey

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,640
i would say is knowledge transfer

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,039
and external visibility that is

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,600
visibility from outside

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:36,880
our own ecosystem are lacking

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,640
in other words if we take the survey at

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,919
face value

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,720
we have to acknowledge divide many users

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,440
are experienced with either linux or

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,799
open source distributions but

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,160
as as almost as many users struggle

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,799
with the basics so

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,400
a natural fix would be work on knowledge

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,280
transfer

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,120
through support documentation sprint

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,960
sessions

00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,080
mentorship and ideally

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,000
the way we would do this would be a way

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,799
that builds on knowledge that people

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,360
might already have from other operating

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,480
systems

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,480
since many of them are switches

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,520
so that's that's one thing and the the

00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,640
second thing is

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,240
promotion is lacking in the sense that

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,840
open source is not perceived

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,039
well enough outside of its own ecosystem

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,120
and here again the fix is

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,360
the fact that we organize a survey gives

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,200
us some visibility because

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,520
people are interested in it they take

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,760
part in it they talk about it

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,880
and it echoes back to the

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:52,559
to the big cave that is

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,320
the internet and it gets us

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,320
some attention and some awareness

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,919
so even though we learn quite a lot from

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,280
the survey

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,240
we have to be humble and to acknowledge

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,240
that

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,520
one thing we did learn is that we didn't

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,200
learn enough

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,760
we need to take the survey with a grain

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,520
of salt for instance many

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,240
linguistic groups are probably

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,280
underrepresented in our numbers

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
that is easily verifiable if you if you

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,360
browse

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,320
the telegram groups

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,440
which are not which don't use english as

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,440
their main language

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,360
that applies also to i mean if you if

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:39,280
you do a google search

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,440
you will find that you have many people

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,039
interested in open source and using open

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,760
source

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:51,440
from southern america from

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,760
eastern asia and these do not really

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,760
show up in our numbers

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,679
also we have to acknowledge that data

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,640
collection was a bit lacking

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,200
we didn't have formal validation which

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,400
led to

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,440
incomplete or noisy results

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,840
for instance we couldn't really detect

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,080
if

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,960
someone had missed um uh

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,840
completing an option or if it was done

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,520
on purpose

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:22,880
etc etc um

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,080
so so it was it was it polluted

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,159
our results quite uh quite a bit and

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,320
finally our data analysis was not really

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,760
thorough

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,039
we didn't do an analysis of covariance

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,159
we didn't do clusterization that means

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,159
we were not able to break down for

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:45,520
instance the property

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,640
of having difficulties doing

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,000
x into groups that would be

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,919
characterized by

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,480
different levels of experience so we

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,440
didn't know if doing x was

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,400
more or less difficult for people who

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,559
had

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:06,080
5 10 15 years of experience

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,720
and also

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,120
as far as data analysis is concerned we

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,880
didn't have a really easy way to process

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,840
open questions um that's something

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,159
the other the other things probably can

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
be

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:24,640
mitigated if not um

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,200
if not fixed using um the software we're

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,240
using

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,159
um but uh

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,000
processing up in question is a little

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,360
bit more tricky

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,679
so just to to be clear open questions is

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,520
when you just ask people write something

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,520
give give me some input in that text

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,240
field and

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
like suggestions etc etc or what would

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,880
you do if

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,480
or what would you recommend or

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,200
suggest or tell us about uh

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,880
tell us about your life basically and

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,080
that's difficult because

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,000
um it shifts the burden

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,440
towards um doing text-based research

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,520
and it's a different um

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,679
set of tools that and methods that are

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,720
required here so

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:21,760
it's complex and we're not sure we are

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,760
really able to to to do this right now

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,720
so what can you expect for next year

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,200
because we all agreed we would be doing

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,320
this every single year

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,000
um basically we want to involve

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,679
developers

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:43,600
we want to equalize participation

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:49,440
and we want to improve data collection

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:51,679
so the first thing involving developers

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,559
we want to make sure that they have

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,600
their say

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,240
in designing the survey why because we

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,440
want

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,720
them to be able to probe interest

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,480
or get feedback about packages

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,440
configurations or settings for instance

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,000
should we should we ship pipe wire by

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,440
default

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,559
instead of paul's audio

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,760
let's ask the people beforehand if

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,200
possible

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,840
if not after the release has been done

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,720
so that we can know if problematic use

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,080
cases

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,919
have emerged so that's one thing

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,679
another thing is we want the word of

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,559
mouth to spread across

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,960
all the user groups so as to secure a

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,240
more

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,559
equal participation

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,720
we want nobody left behind we want

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,400
everyone to have their say

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,120
in the survey just because

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,720
english is not your main language we

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,559
don't want you to

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,600
learn about it later than others or

00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,240
have misconcept misconceptions or

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,360
think that it's not worth taking because

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,919
you can't

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,360
affect the course of events etc we

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,640
really want to make sure that

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,080
everyone is on the same page and uh

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,080
have a shot at that and finally we want

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,039
to be able to better

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,400
discern problematic cases and extract

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,600
actionable

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,480
information for potential users

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
and potential contributors that is we

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,120
want to

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,640
lower the um

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:34,799
barrier of entry for people who are

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,279
interested in open source distributions

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,600
but

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,880
are a bit reluctant um

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,799
to deep toe and likewise for

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,480
contributors

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,240
i mean i work a lot with the

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,840
documentation team

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,000
and we have a lot of people that ask

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,960
information

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,279
and then they find out that they have to

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
like

00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,440
produce this information themselves

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,159
because it's not here it's not

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,080
here yet and we want to make sure that

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,720
these people

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,320
can be helped and can be support

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,760
supported so that

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:15,120
they and they become maintainers and

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,120
contributors themselves

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,279
so time to wrap up so harmony through

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:23,039
fairness

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:26,960
demands that we minimize and mitigate

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,840
frictions by evolving users in decisions

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,399
and by trying to meet their needs it

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,080
also demands that we give users heads up

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,320
before changes

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,120
and that we facilitate knowledge

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,919
transfer

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,279
to make them more resilient to breakages

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,279
and to help them contribute

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,960
and that's something that the end of the

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,760
year surveys

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
are very very useful for because they

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,880
identify

00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,919
needs areas of friction

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:05,440
and opportunities for improvements

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,440
both before and after a change

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,559
and as a bonus

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:16,000
they get us talked about by influencers

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:19,679
um you have neil gompat

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,960
invited to um

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,159
uh this week in linux you have uh

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,200
gerhard pfeiffer

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,960
uh invited

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:34,240
to um a linux broadcast

00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,960
to talk about things the people from the

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,240
community

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:42,080
are asked questions about us

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:46,000
about the survey about what we intend to

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:48,559
do with information and that in itself

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,279
is a plus for the community because it

00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,240
improves

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:57,440
visibility and also it like

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,200
it it shows that we care about the users

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,360
and about the people

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,240
that make up the community so in a

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,799
nutshell

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,159
i would say the surveys on the good

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,200
thinkers

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,679
they really empower people um and they

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,840
make

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,440
the dual crescent we were talking about

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,320
earlier

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
worth living in

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,240
so i do want to thank you for joining

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,520
adrian myself for the
