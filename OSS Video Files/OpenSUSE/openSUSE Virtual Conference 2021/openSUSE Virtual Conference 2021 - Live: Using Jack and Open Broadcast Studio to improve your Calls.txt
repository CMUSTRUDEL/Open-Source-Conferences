In a world of online meetings and conferences there are many things we can't do at the moment, at the same time however we are doing far more online.

So what can we do to make our experiences better whether its video conferencing, preparing talks, podcasting or recording youtube videos.

At the same time this conferences format being online provides me with the ideal environment to talk about this with easy access to gear etc.

From a technical perspective I will cover the following:

* Using obs to create overlays during conference calls.
* Configuring Jack
* Using Calf audio plugins to improve your audio quality
  * Noise Gates
  * Compression
  * EQ
* Using your computer as a guitar amp.

Could probably also be a 30 minute talk instead.
