Title: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021 - Live: Using Jack and Open Broadcast Studio to improve your Calls
Publication date: 2021-06-19
Playlist: openSUSE Virtual Conference 2021

In a world of online meetings and conferences there are many things we can't do at the moment, at the same time however we are doing far more online.

So what can we do to make our experiences better whether its video conferencing, preparing talks, podcasting or recording youtube videos.

At the same time this conferences format being online provides me with the ideal environment to talk about this with easy access to gear etc.

From a technical perspective I will cover the following:

* Using obs to create overlays during conference calls.
* Configuring Jack
* Using Calf audio plugins to improve your audio quality
  * Noise Gates
  * Compression
  * EQ
* Using your computer as a guitar amp.

Could probably also be a 30 minute talk instead.

[Music]

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,920
g'day everyone how's it going

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,400
um i'm simon i'm here to talk to you

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,080
about

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,240
the talk you should have had before you

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:22,320
written your calls for the conference

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,320
about how you can do your calls and your

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,080
online streams and your

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,880
conference talks better using a

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,880
broadcast studio and jack

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,800
the first slide so this is what we're

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,760
going to cover

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,039
we're going to have a quick about me

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,079
then we're going to look at

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,600
open broadcast studio then

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,440
i'm going to cover a same way to

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,440
configure jack

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,840
because there's lots of non-sane ways

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,840
and finally we might have a bit of fun

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:14,159
so quick about me i've used linux

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,080
since 2002 been caesar since 2011.

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
i've worked for sues for a few years

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
after

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,280
contributing to open caesar i'm in my

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,240
fourth year in the board

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,439
um but also kind of relevant to this

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,360
talk

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,119
i have a significant history working

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
with live audio

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
and i've done a bit of video switching

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,280
stuff as well

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,600
but audio is what i'm more passionate

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
about

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,000
so i'm going to start with some

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,040
disclaimers

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,920
firstly i won't be covering pipewire

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,600
um most of what i've worked on for this

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,799
talk i've done over the last couple of

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
hack weeks

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,640
that caesar's had so thanks to them for

00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,079
letting me work on it

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:03,680
um but pipe wire wasn't ready then

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,280
it's probably slightly more ready now

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,399
but i need another half week to play

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,599
with it

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,400
um the second massive disclaimer

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,720
is this whole talk is a live demo of the

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,200
things that i'm talking about

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,400
i've already had some minor issues i

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,959
might have more

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,560
everything might break i might have to

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,160
come back and re-record this tomorrow

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,400
who knows um but

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,520
it'll be fun there are some things i

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
didn't get to set up because of my

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
issues this afternoon

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,519
which means maybe you'll learn more um

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,879
the next disclaimer is the approach i'm

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:45,360
taking can be cpu intensive

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,280
so if you're

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,720
trying to stream video games and stuff

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,280
like that

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
this may not work for you you may need

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,400
more hardware

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,920
but this generally works fine for calls

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,519
um and the final disclaimer is

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,120
i don't generally do my audio production

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,080
on linux

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
so there's lots of things i don't know

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
but

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,000
there is a workshop tomorrow afternoon i

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,080
think on it

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,480
and so go check that out if you're more

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,480
interested

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,640
so on to open broadcaster software

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,360
which is often called obs studio

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,920
it's not the obs build system we use

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,440
it's software for video recording and

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,159
streaming

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,120
it's letting me do things like show

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:43,120
these slides with my face in the corner

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,120
or switch to a bigger picture of me

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
or

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,200
show a spaceship if you don't want to

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,799
see my if i don't want you to see my

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,519
camera

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,799
um and i can click the wrong button and

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
i'll probably do that again before the

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,239
end of the talk

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,840
and i can click the wrong button again

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,840
and you can see two cameras

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,959
let's go back to my slides for a second

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:15,360
where am i going next

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:19,120
so the way this bit of magic is useful

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,320
for um

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,639
for doing conference calls

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:30,000
and talks and stuff like that is

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,759
using v4l to loopback

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,680
you can create a virtual webcam and then

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,680
i can go to jitsi and tell

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,400
it to use my virtual webcam the same

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
with teams

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,680
i've done it all the time with them

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,400
finally on this slide i've put some

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,759
notes

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,600
about things i had to do at one point

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,040
i think some of this is an open season

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,040
tumbleweed

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,040
i probably did it manually when i did it

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,240
um obviously obs studio is also great

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,080
for recording or streaming

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,280
um now we're back on to

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,400
using obs studio so now is when we get

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,400
to see a bit of a live demo

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
that's changed slides

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,919
now what you can see is my control

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,680
window zooming into infinity

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,720
i think somewhere here we go

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:44,160
so here i have a webcam thing

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,720
image it's this camera image i have a

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
jack

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,440
we'll get onto that later

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,680
i only just discovered you need that in

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,280
each of them for it to work

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,800
and on this instance i'm also sharing my

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,479
whole screen

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,479
so i could move that around

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,400
i can

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,600
move my camera around you can see it's

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,240
hiding the kind of

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,759
recursive windows that's the main reason

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,120
why it's there

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,880
um i can add things

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,160
there's a bunch of things there's text

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,840
there's more cameras

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,120
we can have as i did before

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,240
we can have two cameras because

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,120
my laptop has a webcam as well so now

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,120
you can see me twice

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,360
you can add fun pictures and graphics

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:52,880
that's how i'm doing my borders

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,880
so if we just insert an image

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,360
and if i make that so you can see it i'm

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,880
just going to pick the border image

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,800
i hope that's the one i want

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,800
so there we go we've got that

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,160
get rid of it as well

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,800
i'm going to go back to my slides

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:24,080
now so while i'm here this is also

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
how i'm doing my slides

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
my slide screen is sharing the whole

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,520
desktop

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,080
but with my face in the corner

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,080
so if i

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,800
come back here you can see one of the

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,440
nice things about the enlightenment

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,400
desktop

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,800
is it lets me change

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,160
windows wherever i want i think i might

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,160
have accidentally killed the slide

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,840
so just bear with me while i restart

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,840
this slideshow

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,120
this is the joys of live demos

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:28,160
so here you can see

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:31,599
another one of the layouts i'm using

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,159
in this layout i've got a bigger border

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,959
so i've crossed it left and right

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,560
i often have a messy desk and so if i'm

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,800
in a call

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,479
i want to hide lots of it and that's the

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,000
easy way of doing that

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,040
i still have a messy desk because i

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
didn't get time to clean up

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,800
then here's another one you can notice

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
in

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,399
this one there's this red border

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,560
that means i'm not using the full camera

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,440
and again i've selected

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,440
the bit i wanted

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,120
um so i'm going to talk quickly about

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,480
creating

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:13,680
the overlays basically just fancy images

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:17,120
so if i

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,440
come over here to you can see this

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,959
one i just copied my title slide

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,320
out of libreoffice impress

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,120
i made it full screen i printed the

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,279
screen and there wasn't too much to that

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,279
one

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,720
this one i think i took that title slide

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,360
and made it into a border

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,720
this middle area is transparent so that

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,160
if i put this border on top of the

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,279
camera

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,560
it'll crop off the edges and you can

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,320
also add fun things

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,279
so i regularly have talks

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,680
or meetings with people from fedora and

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,600
they like to talk about fedora a lot

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,399
so if they're talking about fedora a lot

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:05,040
i can put my fedora on

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:07,279
which i'll show you in a second

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,279
so

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
here we go now i've got a fedora on you

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,640
can

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
do much more useful things like this

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,839
than this like

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,839
putting in thumbs up or

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,600
useful raising your hand symbols so

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,040
people can

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,640
see what you want to say something

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:33,839
without talking

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,839
but you can also have fun

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:44,399
so where are we going next oh um

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:48,399
i was having issues with

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,920
the version of obs in tumbleweed

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,440
that wasn't rendering properly so

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,120
here is a list of instructions that you

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,320
don't need to read about how you can

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,640
compile it and then run it

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,360
um i'll mostly put this here so people

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
can read it later

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,880
all right so now

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,160
we're coming on to the second part of

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,279
the talk

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,399
which is configuring jack

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,519
using cadence jack has

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,079
quite a reputation for being

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,360
hard to configure and hard to use but

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,839
really powerful if you know what you're

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,839
doing

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:36,320
cadence which is developed by one of the

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,079
linux distributions that focuses on live

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,040
audio

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,959
makes that much easier and i thought

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,240
that open souza should be as good at

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,920
live audio as any other district so i've

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,440
packaged it

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,240
so we're going to have a look at that

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,240
but first

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,000
there is a couple of things you need to

00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,120
do

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,639
this well the first one is an audio

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,920
interface

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,560
an audio interface is basically a fancy

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,560
sound card

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,519
most sound cards are designed for

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
playing your movies back in surround

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
sound

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,639
whereas an audio interface is a sound

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,839
card that's designed for doing

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
real-time audio quickly

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,839
if i swap cameras

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,040
this crazy box with a headphone stuck to

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,920
it

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,440
here's the audio interface i'm using

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,360
it's a steinberg

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,880
something it kind of works

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,399
mostly works in linux because it has

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,040
class compatible mode

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,000
but it doesn't fully i didn't buy it to

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,120
work in linux

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,600
but it does before you buy something

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
check the wiki for hardware support

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,839
because

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,800
that's important the next thing is as

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,639
you can see i have a

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,639
fanciest fantasy ish microphone

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,560
the best thing you can do to get better

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,959
quality sound

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,040
if you're doing calls often is to get a

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,079
nice microphone

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,040
which you can either get a usb one or

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,240
many of them

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,200
will need a audio interface

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:26,959
and on the type of microphone over here

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,560
i have this cheap i think this was

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,360
20 euros on amazon with this

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,079
mic stand the mic stand is really

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,399
reasonable

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:41,680
the mic is rubbish if you buy

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,279
not all cheap mics are good um the type

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,720
of microphone is also important

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,600
so this microphone here is a very nice

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,040
condenser microphone in my opinion it

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,079
sounds better than the microphone i'm

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,399
using

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:59,440
but because of its design it picks up

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,440
a large amount of background noise

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,440
which isn't always ideal if you're not

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,880
in a quiet environment

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:11,519
and so

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,839
i would recommend getting

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,680
one of these microphones a dynamic mic

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,079
um one of the joys of

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,920
so many people doing podcasts these days

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,519
is

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,800
there are so many microphones out there

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,320
that aren't advertised for podcasters

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,839
any of them will work well for what

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
you're trying to do

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,519
now to use jack

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,120
to its full abilities one thing you have

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:46,480
to do

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,399
is configure real-time priority for

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,320
audio and so firstly you add yourself to

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,519
the audio group

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,199
and then secondly you want to

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,920
create this file with these things in it

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,240
and then members of the audio group can

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,279
run programs with real-time

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,279
priority one day i'll create an open

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,720
season package that just does

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,720
that and that will help everyone

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:25,440
the next step is pretty simple

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:29,199
install cadence and jack mixer so

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,320
the way jack works is

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,519
vastly dim it different to

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,560
the way you we

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:41,440
think about audio it's more like if you

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,000
have a audio studio or something so you

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,000
might have a

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,160
an effect like this or

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,440
as one application or you might have

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,800
a mixing desk there's another

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,639
application

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,000
and basically or you could have an

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,959
instrument

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,600
and basically jack is allowing you to

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:09,839
control how you connect

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,839
all those applications

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,440
so if we come and have a look at cadence

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,680
quickly

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,079
here it is so i'll get to this bit in a

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,959
minute

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:36,079
but the first step is configuring jack

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:39,120
so if i open that window

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,120
and then i send it away

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,399
there we are i'll bring it back let's

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,560
try that again

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:57,839
so gives you a bunch of settings

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,360
um the important ones are here in the

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,000
driver

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,880
so here you can see i've configured my

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
audio interface

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,919
there's a bunch of other devices here

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,919
you could just use a normal sound card

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,520
here you can specify if you go to duplex

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,559
mode that you want

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,199
a different input an output device that

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:29,039
might be interesting if you're using

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,799
say a usb microphone you might use that

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,679
as the input

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,240
and then some other cheap sound card usb

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,840
sound card to connect your headphones to

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:43,919
um sample rate is here

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,720
there is a bunch 44 100 is what

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,600
most people bother dealing with you can

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,240
go above that

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,240
you probably won't notice the difference

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:56,640
i've configured

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,120
a pretty big buffer here because

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,480
this is for a talk i don't care about

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,280
having

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,280
very small milliseconds of latency so

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,200
the smaller you make that buffer the

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,840
less latency you have

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,200
the more cpu you use that's important

00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,480
for

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,080
say if you're trying to record audio

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,039
and you really need that so those

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,039
are the main settings

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,880
cadence makes configuring that easy

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,720
the other thing it does well is it

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,080
creates bridges

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,600
so i've configured to auto start

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:43,840
a bridge to pulse audio which means that

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:47,120
i can send audio in and out of

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,120
pulse if i need to

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,880
in a call that's what i would normally

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,200
do

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,000
if we come back to wherever i left the

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,120
slides

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
and have a look at the next slide

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,559
so the next part of cadence that is

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,600
really useful

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,080
is this tool which

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,080
lets you connect all your different

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,559
applications together

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:19,520
so hardware here is my audio interface

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,400
for reasons i have my microphone plugged

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,400
into input 2.

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,480
ignore this bit for now we'll come back

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,600
to it but then

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,559
i have these two mixers the top one is

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,919
basically

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:37,679
controlling whatever volume

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:41,520
i want to send to my call or my stream

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:45,280
or whatever and so

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:47,360
at the moment it's just a microphone but

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,760
if i'm bored and being dumb i could send

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,520
a drum kit or

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:56,960
a guitar we'll play with that later

00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,160
i also have pulse here but it's muted

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,480
so i could send audio from pulse i then

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,640
have this second mixer here

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,679
and this second mixer is controlling

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:13,600
what i hear so you'll notice i have

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,720
pulse muted in the top one because

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,400
if you're talking to me in a call

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,320
i don't want to send your voice back to

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,679
you that's really annoying

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,400
so generally from pulse audio

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,280
i'm taking the cool audio and sending it

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
directly to my headphones

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,799
along with my microphone so i can hear

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,280
it's working

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,159
and so that's how i control the balance

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,159
of those two things

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,280
for today we have a slightly different

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,799
setup

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,799
so

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,200
i have as well a

00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,880
extra record out and that's going to obs

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,400
studio

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,600
so that the video team can grab that

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
and send that to you and that's how

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,200
you're hearing your audio

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,120
normally you would hear it up here

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,039
through pulse

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,200
then i've got my headphones connected to

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,960
one and two

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:23,200
and i could drag things around

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,200
and if i wanted

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,799
whatever i have plugged into mic for

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:35,360
to go straight through

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,919
back to output four i just drag a line

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,919
then i can

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,640
disconnect it when i don't want it

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,280
anymore

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,679
the other thing that jack can take care

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,600
of

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:53,360
is midi which we will play with

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,480
perhaps a bit later or we would have

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,440
if my midi keyboard had showed up not

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,280
sure what's going on there

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,640
but media allows you to send control

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,640
signals between programs

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:14,320
and so let's have a look

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:18,880
now this tool

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:22,320
also lets you add new applications

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,320
run custom applications

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:30,400
and you can have different studios so

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,760
for example i've got one for this talk

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,720
then i had the one i showed you before

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:39,280
for normal conference calls

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:41,520
um the add new application

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,760
i'll show you it it's not properly

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,400
integrated with open caesar

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,360
on my version of cadence today it's

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,039
completely broken

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:53,120
it was kind of working but you can

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,520
theoretically automatically add your

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,799
applications here

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:03,840
some instruments this is

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,840
things i'll get to

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,880
making sure they work later for now i've

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,640
been

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,919
you can see i've got three applications

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,840
here

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,840
i've run custom commands which

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:26,480
if we were to come to the next slide

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,960
up the slide we're already at

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,840
so i'm launching two instances of jack

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,039
mixer

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:36,720
with different configuration files

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:40,240
and calf with its own

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,279
set of saved set and

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,320
when cadence is working correctly you

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,120
can

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,760
press the go button and it will launch

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,480
everything

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,120
and configure everything directly and

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,480
then when you press the stop button

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:58,960
it will stop it all one of the reasons

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,360
that held me back from using jack and a

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,720
proper microphone in calls was

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,760
the amount of time it took to set up

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,200
and to connect all these things together

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,799
every time

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,720
it was just painful and annoying so i

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,880
didn't do it often

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,279
i don't like leaving my audio interface

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,640
on 24 7 with

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,760
jack running so normally now

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,200
that this saves my session state i'll

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,880
start my

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,120
i'll turn on my interface start my

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,600
session i'll do my call

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:34,960
i'll close it down then i'll turn off my

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,960
interface again until i need it

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,520
so now we're going to talk about some

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,559
plugins

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,480
so here you saw

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,679
this big mess basically this is a bunch

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,720
of effects

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,840
and we can use these effects to make our

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,760
call

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,960
sound better i'm gonna

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,520
run you through a couple of the more

00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,840
important ones let's see can i make this

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,840
bigger

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,679
i can't make it bigger so the first

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,279
thing we're going to cover

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:18,240
is a noise gate

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:21,520
um the gate and compressor in here

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,880
i don't think are the best but

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,760
if we open them we can have a look at

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,640
cool visuals and that makes it

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,440
easy for me to explain so basically a

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,120
noise gate

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,200
will cut all the audio

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,360
if it's under a certain level so if you

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,679
have a bit of a noisy mic

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,039
or something like that when people

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,480
aren't talking you

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,400
won't hear the night when you're not

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,440
talking people won't hear your noise

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:54,000
so you can see that as i talk

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,000
this ball comes up based off loudness

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,600
the important setting here is the

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,480
threshold

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,480
so that controls when it kicks in

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,480
if you turn it up too high my voice is

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,159
going to cut out all the time

00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,000
like this you can see that some

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,159
words were triggering it but not all of

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
them

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,640
if i bypass it i can hear a tiny bit of

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,360
noise but not too much

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:32,159
this microphones pretty good but

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,159
if i come to the compressor for a second

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:40,640
and i boost the input here

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,640
sorry that got really loud

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:53,840
but i went i won't talk i'll just let

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:53,840
you hear the noise

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,400
so you can then configure your noise

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,600
gate to get rid of

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:05,440
all that background hiss and noise

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,200
can be quite effective if i

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,640
click away from my microphone you can't

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,640
hear it hang on

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,000
you'll see once i get past the fit a

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,360
certain distance back

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,600
it's not turning on the mic you're not

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,720
hearing that noise that's a pretty

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,720
useful feature in calls

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:37,520
um next thing i'm going to talk about

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:41,600
that's an important tool is a compressor

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,880
so basically what a compressor does is

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:47,520
it limits

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:52,640
your really loud points and

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:55,840
makes your quieter points

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,240
louder so you can see

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,600
if this was the normal audio level you

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,360
can see that

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,720
all my volume under a certain amount

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,840
is boosted slightly but then once you

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,360
get

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,919
really loud i can even

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,840
change that a bit it's going to start

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,559
squashing my signal so if i get

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,120
really loud into the microphone then

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,080
you're not going to hear shouting and so

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,880
if you're a gamer who gets excited or

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,480
something like that

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,720
a compressor can be a really useful

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,360
feature for you

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,520
the next thing i have that i don't have

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,799
turned on at the moment

00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,919
is an equalizer the other mic i was

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,080
using

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,679
has a lot of low end so i was getting

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,200
rid of it

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,600
and there was some other random

00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,799
weirdness here

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:52,720
um it's worth noting equalizers can't

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,760
add things that aren't there

00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,000
but if your microphone is not perfect

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,799
it makes some weird sounds then

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,520
you can fix some things so if i turn it

00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:08,799
on then it sounds a bit like this and

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,799
i've got a bit of a thinner voice

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,799
the next thing i have which

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,120
i didn't even properly set up for this

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:21,279
microphone so it's probably not working

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,279
is a de-esser so

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,440
so if i turn it off some people have a

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,559
lot of

00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,440
sound in their noise in as they speak

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,080
and some microphones pick that up and it

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,559
can be pretty bad

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,880
mine's doing it a little bit if i

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,640
turn it off if i turn it back on that

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,039
fixes it a bit it's another useful tool

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,039
to have

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,320
so finally

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
i had a reverb i was messing around with

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,600
it

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,279
i don't normally use one that much for

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,720
talking

00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,399
i don't particularly like the sound of

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,799
this one for

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:05,840
much talking but we can turn it on

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,840
and i can make the room bigger

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,840
and now i have an echo

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:15,039
so if we come back to

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,360
here's my two mixers you can kind of see

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,600
my volumes

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,000
this orange thing up here means that at

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,120
some point i was too loud

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,120
so i'm just going to clear that

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:36,320
and then all those different effects

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,480
is what you see up here so you can see i

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,640
mainly use my microphone in mono

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,559
so for everything that has two on my

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,080
knees in the first one

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:49,039
but the microphone goes into the gate

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,080
then into the compressor then into the

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,159
equalizer

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,000
then the de-esser i could

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,640
drag these around so i could send the

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,320
second reverb

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,919
into the second gate if i wanted for

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,640
some reason

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,279
and stuff like that and that's how you

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,480
set that up

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:11,279
so again this is where cadence is a

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,279
really helpful tool

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,840
before you come back to my slides

00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:28,159
i think now we get to the fun time which

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,519
i'm going to keep a bit shorter because

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,440
as i said i had some issues this

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:36,480
afternoon and it's not quite

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,480
organized so

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:43,840
but on my desk

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,480
i have a midi keyboard it was working

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,120
all day

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,240
it's now not so we're not even going to

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,640
bother playing with that

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,240
but what we can do is

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,799
this is the mixer that controls what you

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,919
guys hear so

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,960
we're going to create a new input

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:02,399
channel i'm going to set its initial

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,640
value to being

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,640
off

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,840
it's going to be in stereo we don't want

00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,799
direct out

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:17,919
and we're going to call this drums

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,159
and so now we have another channel if we

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,320
come back up here

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,000
you can see we have drums we can play

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,960
with

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,200
so now

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,600
if i run hydrogen which is a drum

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,600
machine

00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,640
and i can add a kick drum

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,240
snare

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,840
let's have

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:11,279
some high hats uh a crush

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:15,519
there's a simple drum loop

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:19,120
and so that is actually playing

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,120
i don't know

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,240
how that's playing oh

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,200
so i can hear that you can't because

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,720
it's connected it directly to

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
it connected that directly to my

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,200
playback so sorry i could hear that

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,519
you guys couldn't we need to take the

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,960
drum out

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,960
and hook it up to the mixer

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,519
and now if i hit play and now if we have

00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,519
a look at it

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,360
i can bring up the volume of the drums

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,360
which might be fun

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,640
for you to if you're a guitarist or

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,640
something

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,960
and you want to jam with something

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,840
there's some basic drums

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,840
that can be some fun now

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,359
we're going to add another channel to

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,079
our mixer

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,079
we're going to call it

00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:24,560
guitar this time

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,560
we're going to launch

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,839
guitar x which is a virtual guitar amp

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,639
in my unpreparedness i have barely

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,480
touched this

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,839
i am also not a guitarist

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,599
i am a bass player but

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,879
i can try and show you something so we

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,000
get the idea

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,440
so our guitar has spawned

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,079
up here this is where things can get

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,200
really messy

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,920
but i want to connect my guitar to the

00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,920
guitar channel

00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,240
then i want to get a guitar lead

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:17,839
that i forgot sorry everyone i'll be

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:17,839
back in a second

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,760
so i now have my guitar lead i'm going

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:31,839
to plug that

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:31,839
into channel 1 of the interface

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:46,079
i can then grab a guitar and plug that

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,839
let's plug that in so

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,359
now i want to take my channel one signal

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,359
and send it into the guitar amp

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:13,200
and then we have a mixer if i bring up

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:16,400
guitar level we have some noise

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,280
and then we can come and play around in

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:26,650
guitarists

00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:33,599
and echoefx

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:37,920
[Music]

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,920
um there's a bunch of stuff you can do

00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
here

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:51,200
it's not the best standing guitar amp in

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,200
the world but

00:36:51,839 --> 00:37:09,839
you can see it's quite noisy this is

00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:09,839
where a noise goes to be useful

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,640
um but that's enough playing with that

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,640
for now

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,839
if you didn't know i was there now you

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,839
do

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:31,520
i think that pretty much concludes

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,520
everything i'm going to talk about for

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,839
