	00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:15,740
so hello buddy I glad you are here so

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:15,740
today now let's talk about the power

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:21,960
first of all I want to rise a question

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,080
is powered that I mean is the

00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:37,290
architecture is a platform you can play

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:39,469
with no so right now you can run linux

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:47,100
on different scope of the hardware

00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:54,090
starting with those old machines or g5

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:58,590
or even on the blue gene Watson brand

00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:05,549
new family power symbol GPUs or even you

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:10,020
can run it under kvm but the hardware is

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:14,939
still produced and on october third

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:21,930
Draves brand new 7 plus was announced

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:29,299
and it's pretty cool cpu they increase

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:29,299
the cash from four megabytes to tan and

00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:44,729
cpu now have a memory compression built

00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:50,640
in encryption and these random number

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:55,140
generator so and the four I don't know

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,369
whether you are familiar with the power

00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:04,200
vm thing this is built in virtualization

00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:07,619
they reduce the number of basically

00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,979
under powervm you can run on the one

00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,610
chord 10 virtual machines or l parts so

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,690
with the seven plus they reduced it to

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:20,600
the five percent so that means right now

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:25,390
on single core you can run up to 20

00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:31,670
machines but it's cool for purposes uh

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:34,850
you can run so where you can run

00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:39,860
opensuse opensuse can be run on this

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:42,650
yeah old machines or on the brand new

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:46,670
machines basically it's all the same d

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:49,010
the depreciation deviation is just a

00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:54,459
matter of bootloader integration and

00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:59,209
that's it and you can run it under kavia

00:02:54,459 --> 00:03:05,780
which is on p 7 machine is really really

00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:10,780
fast with in opensuse we have quite cool

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:15,200
technologies one of them is key be so

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:20,450
thanks to keavy we can build and images

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,299
and easily test them so that means you

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:27,019
build an image you you don't need to

00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:32,269
follow all these process to configure

00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:35,180
the system and you just build the image

00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,700
and you can do it easily with the build

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,260
service so and the build service using

00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:46,150
the TV images to produce actually n

00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:51,950
images which are used in the internal

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:57,100
built work so called built workers um so

00:03:51,950 --> 00:04:01,970
thanks to keevy ah we have right now

00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:08,510
fully supported power bills in the build

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:10,250
service i'm starting to bury beginning

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,459
of februari or something we announced

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:18,769
that right now you can do we now is able

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,410
to do a public bills that means if you

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:25,389
have a base open build service or

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:29,050
opensuse build service account you can

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:32,680
add to your home project PPC bill target

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,400
and you upload the source codes back

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:40,419
files just send them to the build

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,060
service and you are done I mean the the

00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:47,289
medium and the magic happens in the

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:50,740
ground you build the packages and you

00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:55,150
see you can see the result or I haven't

00:04:50,740 --> 00:05:01,840
tested it but probably you can do this

00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:04,830
locally using qmu right so like arm

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,550
people doing it should work and

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:12,219
internally build servers are using kvm

00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:16,060
so heavy i'm on power quite tested I

00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:18,430
mean it's the workers working synth

00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:28,500
machines februari and we building

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:32,430
factory and 12.2 candidate yeah so but

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:39,879
we running quite old hardware that's um

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:44,500
PPC 970 it doesn't have a dirty or so io

00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:48,669
is quite slow so you have to have quite

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:51,099
fashioned or not patient patient to wait

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:55,110
until it belts but we are working on

00:05:51,099 --> 00:06:00,789
that so probably sooner we will have a

00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:06,550
quite few power seven boxes and we might

00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:11,020
have built Spade even faster than x86 so

00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:14,229
um factory currently rebuilding tech

00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:19,210
tree basically factory was built since

00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:23,050
our it never stops building before

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:26,649
februari it was closed I mean we used

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,189
changer to build the packages but it was

00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:32,080
closed for public that means you cannot

00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:34,550
submit the package or you cannot play

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:40,310
with it in your home project

00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:43,040
um and since last release was official

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:47,510
opensuse release of opensuse on power

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:51,130
was 11.1 which was how many years ago

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:55,450
then remember a few years ago but um

00:06:51,130 --> 00:07:01,760
it's still building today I checked the

00:06:55,450 --> 00:07:07,970
amount of failed packages is 8080 right

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:13,220
80 which is quite good of overall amount

00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:15,440
of um five of five thousand packages

00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:26,120
something like that so we're quite would

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:28,600
kill box or l system quite works it you

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,850
can run the base system without I

00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:36,050
haven't tested the graphical mode I mean

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:39,500
the gnome GD whatever x server but the

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:43,660
base they base system works but Lola

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,250
room is installed ball so you just um

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:53,090
inside of the city or build a key the

00:07:46,250 --> 00:08:01,760
image and you ready to run um so far I'm

00:07:53,090 --> 00:08:04,940
aware of only two bucks which is sha wan

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,240
sum is wrong which is annoying but we

00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:11,630
are working on that and I think this

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,500
book is not critical just ya ugly

00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:21,080
annoying thing and other thing as on

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:23,990
poor Mac you if you choose to install XP

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,540
for is the default root filesystem the

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:29,120
bootloader configuration does not work

00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:31,760
so it's broken but if you choose the

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,170
accessory file system as a root

00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:42,279
filesystem everything should be fine um

00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:48,490
but yeah probably I will fix it so

00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:52,959
and that leads us to develop so we can

00:08:48,490 --> 00:09:01,660
release our 12.2 so or even today right

00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:05,470
Marcus 12 going to test it on powermac

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:08,309
so this tiny machine if you want to play

00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:12,639
with it or see how it works how it birds

00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:15,639
you can take a look at it on either here

00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:19,680
right after the talk or on the opensuse

00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:28,420
both even this machine is capable to run

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:32,050
kvm in there um next we tested the 970

00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:38,199
machines are intellistation or not it

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:42,970
was power station and 12.2 works fully I

00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:46,209
mean this XT 4000 the root class system

00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:49,120
1 x.x before works on their power vm so

00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:54,970
that doesn't matter whether you run b5

00:09:49,120 --> 00:10:01,029
b6 b7 even plus um and last but not

00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:04,959
least on you know what is to do right so

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:11,009
I have I had a quite small project on

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:15,569
which porting studio to be able to build

00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:20,110
power images which is works quite well

00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:24,309
I've used that she first of all she

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:27,220
ultimately create the easy way to build

00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:30,910
a key of images or appliances images

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:37,389
itself and this is really nice to have a

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:43,149
it as a kind of framework or environment

00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:47,249
to test the kvm on power so um it works

00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:47,249
very well but this is only

00:10:48,870 --> 00:11:00,960
proof of concept and for for a kvm on

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:06,450
horror you can do the best mature best

00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:09,720
thing recently last spring IBM announced

00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:15,029
a seven-hour two machines so those

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:17,490
machines are right designed to compete

00:11:15,029 --> 00:11:19,560
x86 market so those machines are really

00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:22,290
cheap but they are quite capable and

00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:25,380
they are quite fast and there is a

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:28,110
secret feature not secret that it's not

00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,810
public I mean but people are around

00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:35,400
unknowing about that so you can switch

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:40,200
the machine into the bare metal mold so

00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:42,770
that means you can explore their the kvm

00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:48,240
I mean it it will work there really fast

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:50,550
so if you don't know about the power vm

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:54,380
technologies don't know how to use them

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:58,709
so and the hmc and the IBM scares you

00:11:54,380 --> 00:12:02,700
you can have this bugs switch the

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:06,300
trigger and have a fully better bare

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:10,740
metal mode and the manage kvm there as

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:17,400
you doing that on under the on the x86

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:26,610
machine so that's quite cool so that

00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:31,920
this is it is it cool right so what the

00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:36,540
thing about it are any areas where we

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:41,910
can improve or maybe we need more to

00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:44,750
tell people about that the open source

00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,750
is there or

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:59,329
I want to feedback from you yeah I was

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:03,660
trying to install opensuse powervm but

00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:06,240
the IBM only for our open yes

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:10,829
installation for a fuel system like red

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:16,199
hot or juice you mean this connect don't

00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:18,689
find any information or clue how do it's

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:22,379
basically the same thing if you using

00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:25,410
powervm you basically should have the

00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:28,199
virtualized server the load open sea org

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:31,949
slash poured / distribution / 12 pointe

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:35,490
shoes / i saw you that the individual I

00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:41,550
saw create the virtual CD drive every

00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:44,519
from it that's it I can show you I I'm

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,759
doing it I can show you my playground

00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:52,920
and I'll it I mean from the virtualizer

00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:55,610
attractive what kind of boot loader or

00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,850
are switching to grab the two are

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:03,779
currently we are using a rabbit but

00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:06,410
packet soda grab two in the post script

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:10,439
section it tries to install itself

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:14,490
witches I found quite weird on so we

00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:18,420
need to fix a grab to first I mean this

00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:23,490
pack file its installation behavior and

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:30,269
then on you can use it um basically like

00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:32,759
drop to install or and the disk device

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,939
it and italy what you can do is in

00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:40,040
download the 12 point to install it then

00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:43,679
go to the build service branch in there

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,269
we are liking of only in the integration

00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,199
at the distribution so if you will

00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:48,199
install it manual

00:14:49,830 --> 00:15:06,040
more question I'm academician I've ever

00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,800
had high-performance computing and so on

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,110
so on but I had made that I'm not very

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,600
familiar with souza distribution how

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:22,600
souza supports high performance

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:25,600
computing if it is good but soon the

00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,800
basically it's a PHP see machine right

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:39,030
the Watson IBM Watson and it runs less

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:39,030
and so any more questions

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,790
it's actually not a question it's just a

00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,200
follow-up Sodor's there was recently

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,820
announcement of the so-called

00:15:52,200 --> 00:16:01,350
blockbuster that is in Munich in top 10

00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:03,090
or top 20 number four thanks I don't I

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,640
didn't forget I have a picture in my

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:14,580
presentation later but I don't remember

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:17,100
the effect we have more questions and in

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:21,270
and probably one remark is there is a

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,910
top green our rating or something like

00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:27,830
that and the first chain places are

00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:33,990
owned by power machine machines are

00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:39,960
green I mean probably from perspective

00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:41,490
oh so it's train lat machine so if there

00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,980
are no more questions I would like to

00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:56,760
thank again or speaker for this

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:59,850
presentation thank you we now have a

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:03,510
lunch break for one hour in this room

00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:06,890
but there are talks running in our rooms

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,890
in the same

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,160
