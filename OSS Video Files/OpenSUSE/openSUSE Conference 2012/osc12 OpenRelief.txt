okay everybody we have here same

00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,090
Coughlin he's an expert in communication

00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,240
methods in business development he's a

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,530
well known for building bridges between

00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,309
commercial and non-commercial

00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,010
stakeholders in the technology sector

00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:19,380
and he will speak up he will speak to us

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,439
about the oven relief the open lifting

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,869
and how using open-source software and

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,550
open hardware pools they build disaster

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,859
relief tools disasters such as

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,500
earthquakes earthquakes weather

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:37,230
disasters radiation disasters okay so

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:39,930
let's welcome him well ladies and

00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,989
gentlemen can you hear me clearly no

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,780
problems there so today I'm going to

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,480
give you a bit of a lightning tour of a

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,390
project that's trying to integrate

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,640
hardware software and management

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,600
processes to solve a very specific

00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,879
problem as you're probably well aware we

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,039
have quite a few disasters around the

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:05,339
world every year quite a few of those

00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,990
are serious and disaster relief efforts

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:12,390
to respond are often extremely hard to

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,850
arrange basically disaster relief is

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,830
trying to peer through fog something

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,439
large happens and you have to go in

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,750
there and try to work out how big was it

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,850
how much is damaged how many people are

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:27,509
in trouble and how to get help to them

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,500
as quickly as possible open relief as a

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,890
project was particularly inspired by the

00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,430
2011 Tohoku tsunami and earthquake in

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,290
Japan where we had the unfortunate

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,869
incident of losing approximately 500

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,450
kilometres of coastline water came in

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,759
land up to 10 kilometers at points and

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,079
we had over a hundred thousand people

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,810
displaced with 20,000 dead that type of

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,040
incident really graphically illustrates

00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,979
how as far as technology has come as

00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,680
small as the world is today how we can

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:09,090
be badly stranded and confused when

00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,629
nature strikes now open relief is a

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,390
project to try to plug some of the gaps

00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:15,670
it's trying

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,880
developed tools to help people respond

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,860
more quickly in particular we're trying

00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,500
to solve the problem of understanding

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:26,380
what just happened clearing the fog a

00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,490
little bit so disaster relief can be

00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:33,160
quicker again a good illustration is the

00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,140
Tohoku disaster where it took almost two

00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,380
weeks before we had a clear

00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:41,890
understanding of the geography and human

00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:43,989
situation inside the disaster zone the

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,239
roads were gone infrastructure was gone

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:48,520
we had people displaced we had people

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,890
dead we had people quite simply missing

00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,200
that turned up in different areas it

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,989
took a very long time to get the ducks

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,690
in a row so that we could do things like

00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:01,720
add food medicine and other provisions

00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:04,959
to people in the quantities needed even

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:07,030
though to give you perspective Tohoku

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,610
was about three hours drive from Tokyo

00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,010
when I visited on one of the relief

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,800
drives one and a half weeks into the

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,100
disaster in some areas people were still

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,660
on quite strict rations we simply didn't

00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,180
have the logistics and the understanding

00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,670
of how to get the things to people

00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,620
quickly enough open relief well we're

00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,820
trying to deal with that what we're

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,630
trying to do is we're trying to get

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:34,870
information to disaster relief first

00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:37,299
responders a lot more quickly than we

00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,519
could in the past and the purpose for

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:42,040
this is is really simple we want to get

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,400
the rite aid to the right people at the

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,350
right time we want to avoid situations

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,239
which do happen in reality where you

00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,700
have trucks of provisions going into a

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,709
disaster zone arriving at a shelter

00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:56,290
where you have hundreds of people who

00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:58,630
just had a similar delivery a few hours

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,640
ago the truck then has to go all the way

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:02,860
out of the disaster zone and wait for

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,799
reassignment meanwhile somewhere else

00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,049
people are hungry people are cold people

00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,060
need medicine this is this is a very

00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,700
serious issue it's something that open

00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,160
relief is going to contribute slightly

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,959
towards of course we can't solve this

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,169
problem but we might be able to reduce

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,440
the amount of waste and time lost the

00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:25,450
first step is what we will cover in some

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,840
detail today the first step is work on

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,960
us

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,730
this was a big issue in Japan at one

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,449
point we were having a meeting with

00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:37,510
multiple NGOs we had triad doctors going

00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:39,310
into the disaster zone and we had a

00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:43,000
question about a particular village on a

00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:45,580
peninsula we were unable to find out if

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,889
that village existed if the people from

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,930
the village were still there in any

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:52,210
quantity if they needed provisions or

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,979
had they been moved elsewhere the

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,410
village was 40 kilometers away from

00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:59,260
where we were but to get there took over

00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,030
four hours if we had had the ability to

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,970
do quick reconnaissance we could have

00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:06,520
had that task accomplished in less than

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,770
an hour as it happened that particular

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,780
village was fine the military had pushed

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:12,880
through provisions had been sent from

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,729
another area they did not need help it

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,650
was a wasted trip we want to be able to

00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,960
do quick reconnaissance and mapping to

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:23,320
reduce that type of waste and we want to

00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,840
introduce a way to do that that is in

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,240
some ways revolutionary a drone but in

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,919
other ways very accessible the

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
technology we want to use to accomplish

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,030
this we want it to be something that is

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,900
available to everyone around the world

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,460
at extremely low costs I'm going to

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,200
explain that to you now and in a little

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,360
bit of detail first of all let's start

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,130
with the requirements so the basic

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,960
requirements are fairly simple we need

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:49,389
something that disaster responders can

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,610
bring into a disaster zone and just put

00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:52,960
down and launch almost anywhere so

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,150
basically it needs to take off from

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,800
footpads it needs to have the capability

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,320
where possible to automatically

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,150
recognize roads people and things like

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,000
smoke so you understand what is

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:07,090
happening in a disaster zone it needs to

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,220
photograph film and map the landscape so

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,919
the Disaster Response Teams can have

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:14,370
quick analysis of the situation and it

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,770
needs to where possible whether the

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,810
measure the weather radiation and other

00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,210
things that might affect your disaster

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:24,099
response in Japan as you'll be well

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,160
aware that was particularly important

00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:29,320
because of the Fukushima Daiichi triple

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,820
reactor explosion and the subsequent

00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,860
concerns about where the radiation

00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,740
clouds were heading and in what

00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,969
quantities so if we have a pretty pretty

00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,649
broad mandate for

00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:40,059
want to do but we found a lot of the

00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:44,169
things well quite frankly they were

00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:45,669
already ready here is opencv running in

00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:47,759
an early version of our code it's

00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:50,439
recognizing roads here from photographs

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,239
here it is recognizing people a very

00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:55,239
important thing for working out who's on

00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:56,649
the ground and then it's going to show

00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:58,839
you in a second what I think is one of

00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:01,989
the very cool parts of the technology

00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:04,059
it's recognizing smoke here imperfectly

00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:06,249
but it's getting smarter we're adding

00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:08,769
flame recognition as well which allows

00:07:06,249 --> 00:07:12,309
you to have a pretty good idea of danger

00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:14,469
points on the ground that is opencv with

00:07:12,309 --> 00:07:16,689
a bit of custom coding very small amount

00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:19,059
of custom coding and a little bit of

00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:21,249
training the extra bits we've added we

00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:23,529
are of course releasing online so

00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,449
everyone can integrate them but it was

00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,309
surprising how some of our what you

00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:29,739
could say more difficult requests

00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:31,539
recognize people on the ground turned

00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:34,079
out to be fairly easy to accomplish a

00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:37,689
lot of that work had already been done

00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:39,219
the plane had not been done and that's

00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,429
where we had to put quite a bit of time

00:07:39,219 --> 00:07:44,259
and thinking into it so the idea here

00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:46,149
was that this technology would be

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,999
accessible all over the world without

00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:51,219
having to rely on a single provider open

00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:53,309
relief itself is a design project we

00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:55,659
have no intention of building and

00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:57,879
distributing the technology we're

00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:59,800
designing it we want everyone else to be

00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,899
able to build it either commercially or

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,629
non-commercially so off-the-shelf

00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:07,119
components open hardware where possible

00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:10,749
so that you can machine it wherever you

00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:13,329
are and open source and free software

00:08:10,749 --> 00:08:15,399
wherever possible as well so that the

00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:17,439
code to run the thing the code to

00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,110
recognize people the code to communicate

00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,269
the results that's accessible to

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:25,769
everyone without any fees without any

00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:29,529
barriers the first steps essentially

00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:32,949
were very simple lots of glue fiberglass

00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:34,990
balsa wood basically the technology is

00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:38,409
extremely primitive and our first

00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:40,839
prototypes were large RC airframes we

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,759
built two prototypes one for the UK and

00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:43,809
one for Japan you can see them on the

00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,630
floor they are being put together

00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:49,660
they're about two metres wide these

00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:50,250
prototypes were essentially fiberglass

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,530
over

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,490
also would with some metallic elements

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:59,790
and well they kind of worked here is the

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,270
Japanese drone hanging around a lunar

00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,220
eclipse a few months ago it was painted

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,440
red simply for visibility and because

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,640
that matched the Japanese disaster

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,340
response colors the the thing is the

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,900
first airframe it was out of materials

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,480
that you can get anywhere so it's

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,850
fiberglass it's balsa wood it's 1.6

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,090
meters wide it's about 1.2 meters long

00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:25,650
the wait is very very low it's only two

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:28,170
to three kilos depending on how you set

00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:31,890
it up and it can have 20 to 30 minutes

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:33,570
endurance it's not very fast so 20 to 30

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:37,680
minutes endurance translates into

00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:39,990
somewhere around 12 to maximum maximum

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,600
30 kilometers if you're able to glide

00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:46,290
and so on not just use power all the

00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,910
time as I said it kind of worked this

00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,310
first airframe allowed us to have proof

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:53,520
of concept that you can build a drone at

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,589
very low costs it was pretty fragile the

00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:58,320
range was pretty low and quite frankly

00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:02,460
it was pretty easy to break and quite

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,410
hard to fix but but but the important

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,240
point I put in here is that we managed

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:08,940
to build that airframe with the

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,550
autopilot the computer the engines the

00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,530
batteries all of that for approximately

00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,780
seven hundred and forty dollars per unit

00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:17,940
which changes the game and drones

00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,710
completely before you'd have to spend

00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,320
around twelve thousand dollars to have

00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:24,330
comparable ability so seven hundred

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,370
forty dollars because we used off the

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:29,370
shelf open hardware and open source

00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:32,400
software kind of worked kind of worked

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,050
up phase two of course is to take the

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,880
kind of worked and start to turn it into

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,040
something that can really be used in the

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:41,520
real world we were actually helped out

00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,560
here from the the other side of drones

00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:48,260
the kind of the military industrial

00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,820
complex we were contacted by a UK

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,130
aeronautical engineer and head of a UK

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:55,140
company that is working on a commercial

00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,060
vertical takeoff and landing drone

00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,010
technology this vertical takeoff and

00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,740
landing drone technology is very small

00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:04,050
very capable and I suppose eventually

00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,000
will be a very expensive solution from

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,830
militaries around the world to have

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,260
vertical takeoff and landing with

00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,620
horizontal flight at up to 240

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,510
kilometers an hour anyway that company

00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,420
as part of their development process had

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,950
built this a prototype conventional

00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,410
airframe to test some of the principles

00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:24,680
like the counter-rotating propellers to

00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,839
prevent torque and increase stability

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,230
and they contacted us and said your

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,930
airframe is off the shelf this airframe

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,399
is fully designed with CAD we're not

00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,040
going to sell it how would you like it

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,019
so this this became what I believe is is

00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,510
actually the world's first open source

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,610
airframe they gave us all the CAD

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,769
drawings all the technology on this and

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,140
the head of the company is helping us

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:51,450
further develop it so this this

00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:53,370
particular airframe going to dive into

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,120
it a bit is it's very similar to the

00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:00,540
first its aluminium its wood its 1.8

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,810
meters wide 1.4 meters long it weighs 3

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:06,300
kilos or so it has 12 kilos of trust

00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,970
which is an awful lot of trust given the

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,410
weight it can fly for hours on electric

00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:12,930
if you load it with batteries you can do

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,410
about 10 hours on gasoline and it can

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:18,329
fly at about 160 kilometers an hour so

00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:21,870
basically this airframe is very light

00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:25,470
very small very capable it can carry

00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,620
about 9 kilos of cargo as needed and it

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:31,649
can fly for up to 10 hours or a thousand

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:34,380
kilometers so that particular airframe

00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:36,060
has very advanced features even though

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,829
it looks very simple the

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,200
counter-rotating propellers I mentioned

00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:42,779
before they help prevent the airframe

00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,670
having instability in flight like torque

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,740
shake so that your camera stays stable

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,230
and recognizing people on the ground is

00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,779
easier it has a variable center of

00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:53,970
gravity the wing actually the main wing

00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:56,579
moves to change the center of gravity of

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,260
the aircraft depending on cargo so that

00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,850
when it's flying light it's extremely

00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,709
stable when it's flying heavy it's

00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:05,130
extremely stable that type of very

00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:07,199
simple technology is a revolution for

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:09,480
these small aircraft we haven't had that

00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:11,640
before it has channels on it like a

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,130
movie camera so that you can clip things

00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,020
on whatever is needed to reconfigure the

00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,970
airframe into new uses whether you

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,920
needed to have conveyed

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,779
landing whether you needed to land on

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,250
water where do you wanted to fly into

00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:23,870
Nets you can change the outer

00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:27,139
configuration of the airframe as

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:30,079
required it has a large cargo space in

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:33,410
the fuselage as as Eddie the designer

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:36,589
said it is a basically a 3 2 liter cola

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:38,360
bottle cargo space it will hold three

00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,949
two liter cola bottles down the cargo

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,629
space so you can load it up with

00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:43,129
whatever you need if you need to send

00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,199
something over the horizon the people

00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:47,170
you can't get to you can do that you can

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,970
do that up to nine kilos of weight and

00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,649
it as I said it can be reconfigured so

00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:53,689
it can launch by rails it can launch

00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:55,459
conventionally it can go off water it

00:13:53,689 --> 00:13:57,709
doesn't matter you can reconfigure it

00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:01,279
into any shape you want because of the

00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:04,459
external rails along the fuselage I have

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,860
some photos of what what it is because I

00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,680
think it's very cool this is what we got

00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,410
the prototype the counter rotating

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,939
propeller engine this is the rail system

00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:15,769
with the body being put together in

00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:18,610
three sections these are the electronic

00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:21,709
speed controls to cool down with air the

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,139
the engine components it has got the

00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:27,490
cargo space displayed there you can see

00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:30,709
the main fuselage in one piece with the

00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:33,620
adjustable wing right there the first

00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,540
version of it displayed here and at the

00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,069
open source hardware summit a couple of

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,559
months ago that's Eddie and white

00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:41,750
showing a slightly more advanced version

00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:44,360
of the airframe little details on it

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:47,029
again quite revolutionary you might be

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:50,209
able to see on the tail do you see two

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:53,000
black parts on the tail there those are

00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:56,839
the servos to control the flaps and so

00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,750
on on the aircraft each each control

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:02,839
surface has two servos so that when one

00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,610
fails the aircraft does not fail we're

00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:06,259
going to have a very simple method to

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,680
prevent the servos picking each other

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:12,949
out by having a slight zigzag in the

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,420
wire using the wire that the servos use

00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:17,089
so even if they go slightly out of sync

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,860
they don't stress each other in essence

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:22,579
what it means is this this very simple

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,860
airframe which you can fly and rebuild

00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:27,559
if you have a hammer a screwdriver and a

00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:29,420
wrench it has advanced features so that

00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,990
even if it loses servos it doesn't go

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,790
out of this

00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:33,380
I even if you need to reconfigure it

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,050
with a lot of weight that's no problem

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,540
if you need to rebuild it you can get

00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:41,149
plastic piping for the fuchsia lies it's

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:43,339
an extremely flexible solution and it

00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,899
comes out of a sort of an area where

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,089
they need that because naturally with

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,190
military technologies they don't always

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:52,430
have optimal conditions this is built

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:54,620
for that type of arena and we were given

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,750
it we were given it and we put it out

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,640
there so we've released it under an open

00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,940
hardware license and you can download it

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:03,170
at that link did this airframe I'll be

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,060
frank with you it's under development

00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,339
I'm going to get to our milestones in a

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,529
second and explain the release date so

00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:11,540
the CAD files you'll get there are of

00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,550
the first generation of the airframe

00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,440
that you saw Eddie with on stage we

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:18,380
found some issues with it already like

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:21,440
the tail broke it got knocked off a a

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,020
stand in wind and the tail broke so we

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,640
redesigned the tail Eddie created a new

00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,190
design for the tail where each segment

00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,140
of the tail is precisely the same so you

00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:33,500
only need one replacement part for all

00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:36,950
three sections of the tail and it's much

00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,079
stronger anyway first version their

00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,899
second version coming soon with improved

00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:44,540
design very simple very interesting

00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:46,040
technology huge range game changer again

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,160
it only costs less than a thousand

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,950
dollars to buy let's dig into it a bit

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:55,550
more the details what is this stuff

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,140
really apart from aspiration well we use

00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,940
what's called the ardupilot to fly the

00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,250
plane if you're aware of drone

00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:04,400
technology in the amateur market you'll

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,959
know the DIY drones community they made

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,760
an autopilot that's extremely capable

00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,069
I'll run through the features in a

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,959
second the camera well the camera you

00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:13,850
can either go really expensive or you

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,850
can go really cheap we went really cheap

00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:20,480
we're using a super h ad camera from

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,970
sony the camera cost $41 from china with

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,500
a full lens build and i'm going to

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,020
explain the details in a second but

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,450
basically it's a it's a door peephole

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:31,870
camera and it gave us enough resolution

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,790
to see people at about 10 kilometers

00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:37,550
that was pretty cool arduino based

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:40,190
sensors throughout easy to program very

00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:42,530
cheap easy to obtain Raspberry Pi to

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,910
process data as what we call the minimum

00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:45,740
naturally we're also play

00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:48,890
with things like Tegra 2 and Tegra 3

00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,260
boards but yeah Raspberry Pi is your

00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:54,460
basic starting point on computation here

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:57,950
any linux based OS to analyze the data

00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:01,370
digging in so the autopilot how many of

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,800
you are familiar with auto pilots zero

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:05,930
in the room one guy there a little bit

00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,970
well this one's interesting because I

00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:09,530
bought this one at three hundred dollars

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,820
and they just released a new version at

00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,280
two hundred dollars with a lot more

00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,080
features and it's a lot better the

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,880
autopilot market has completely changed

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,650
in the last couple of years this

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,230
particular our autopilot the ardupilot

00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:23,930
is completely open source software and

00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,570
open hardware everything about it is

00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:29,060
released under schematics and code this

00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:32,120
means that you can simply build it

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,130
yourself if you're that insistent on

00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,260
playing with diodes or you can buy it

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,960
for two hundred dollars it's got a very

00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,960
simple 80 mega processor it's it's got

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,780
the very small amount of RAM it's a very

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,150
basic chipset but it allows you 600 3d

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,010
waypoints it's able to reboot in midair

00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,990
it's got a black box if the system goes

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,310
down you can work out what happened it's

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,230
got the type of features that were

00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:56,840
completely inconceivable at a

00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,420
two-hundred-dollar price point just five

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,400
years ago that's what we use is the

00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,930
brain to fly the airframe and this brain

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,880
is extremely capable it can be

00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,160
repurposed for land it can be repurposed

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,560
for water it doesn't matter it already

00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,870
has different forms of the code that you

00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:15,620
flash on to it for other use cases if

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:18,650
you happen to need them the the camera

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,570
spec I mentioned it's a door camera from

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,240
China with the lens and the build and

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:24,830
the sensor is from Sony it's a very

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:27,350
simple camera but you'll notice on the

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,050
specs it's extremely capable I mean f

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,990
1.2 it can operate in pretty low light

00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:34,520
indeed it's got resolution which is just

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,740
above television so we can get

00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,660
everything we need for the opencv to

00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,670
recognize things like people and frode's

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,860
and it is able to take a lot of

00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:44,510
temperature variants so when you're

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,040
storing it and so on you needn't worry

00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,810
that you're going to lose resolution on

00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,910
the camera because the lens will fog up

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:51,920
or whatever it's a very versatile

00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:55,130
solution and like I say it only costs

00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,220
$41 off aliexpress.com

00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:00,620
that's where we got it very cool

00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,620
technology just the door camera that was

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,180
over built computer Raspberry Pi now

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,710
these specs are out of date because i

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,560
read that raspberry pi is going to have

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:11,810
512 megabytes of ram from now on the

00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,940
ones we were playing with 256 megabytes

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,890
of RAM Raspberry Pi is a really

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,020
underpowered computer but it's plenty to

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:20,780
connect to the autopilot and do some of

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,840
the computational tasks we would want so

00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,340
for example with the opencv the visual

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,710
recognition it can do some of the

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,750
recognition as it flies it can't do all

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,790
the detailed analysis but it can do some

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,730
of it in the air it's a very cool very

00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:37,520
cheap solution about thirty dollars to

00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,950
get this done and what's useful for us

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,230
was that this particular platform while

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:44,750
being exceptionally cheap was also very

00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:46,670
easy for people to program for would

00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,950
quite a few linux-based distros being

00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:50,620
put on to it and quite a quick community

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:54,650
growing around it very accessible

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:57,770
technology software the autopilot is

00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:59,780
ardupilot we were using 2.3 to basically

00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,250
the operating system as long as it's

00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,870
linux-based it doesn't matter what

00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:05,830
you're using a lot of the Raspberry Pi

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:08,960
stuff is sort of Debian ecosystem-based

00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:12,020
but it doesn't matter you can put

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,880
anything on there opencv two point three

00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,100
point one is what we used for the first

00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,110
systems that code is already released

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,290
online for we've done custom code very

00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:23,810
basic the custom code for smoke people &

00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,940
Rhodes we're also working on structure

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,520
from motion where you build 3d maps out

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,170
of the camera images all of that just

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,780
goes online we're trying to upstream

00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:34,190
what we can what we what we haven't up

00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,330
streamed yet it's just in our

00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:41,600
repositories very simple software

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:43,250
outside the plane the aircraft is very

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,870
capable it can do all kinds of interests

00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,120
and things like mapping and carrying

00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,190
cargo but it's it's useless in some

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,720
other aspects like a plane trying to

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,400
tell you what the weather is like on the

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,340
ground or the radiation on the ground

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,140
not going to happen so we had to think

00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,820
through that problem we wanted to

00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,340
understand what the pollution was what

00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:03,650
the danger was in disaster zones so we

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,520
also need to think about sensors now

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,860
probably everyone in this room knows

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,210
at the open source hardware open source

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,460
software community has been building

00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:13,590
things like radiation sensors Geiger

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,720
counters for people especially in the

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,570
aftermath of the Japanese crisis we

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,030
looked at some of those and we didn't

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,200
find anything that was suitable for us

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:24,360
because we were looking at a situation

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,640
where some of the technology would have

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,970
to be left in the ground out there

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,140
reading for up two weeks at a time the

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,560
Geiger counters that are available

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,030
usually consume a lot of power and in

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,040
many cases they're not built for

00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,080
networking so we had to think through

00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,250
that problem and sort of to play with it

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,980
one of our guys built a radiation sensor

00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,570
that can transmit data to the drone and

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,460
that can be used to make your

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,740
geographical information map of the

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:54,690
disaster the radiation sensor I think

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,820
it's pretty cool it's an anode board

00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:59,150
very simple very simple technology 80

00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:02,790
mega again that chip keeps cropping up

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:05,220
we used a custom ionization chamber for

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:08,190
our test system and our particular

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,070
custom ionization sensor it's it's very

00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,320
similar to a smoke detector it doesn't

00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:16,200
draw any power it just uses a reference

00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:19,320
charge so the only power being drawn is

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,000
for the Nano to get readings that has

00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,620
the interesting result that you're able

00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,560
to leave the sensor for a very long time

00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:28,650
out there getting data here is the

00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:31,020
actual first radiation sensor built in

00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,840
what's basically a jam jar because our

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,120
engineer had a sense of humor very basic

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,340
stuff just a very simple ionization

00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,560
chamber there's the reference charge

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:42,270
from the batteries stack and there's the

00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,010
connected device with the Nano the

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,460
chamber and the batteries built by this

00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:50,040
chap complete lunatic ex british telecom

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,400
engineer called Andrew Beck who splits

00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:55,020
his time between steam-powered

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,520
technology essentially and stuff like

00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,950
this he combined it to make this

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:01,440
radiation sensor total cost of that

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:04,560
radiation sensor is crazy cheap and that

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,290
out is something like $18 the chamber is

00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:09,750
any chamber with metallic elements and

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:12,090
it a way would come to about twenty

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,220
dollars per radiation sensor the

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,560
radiation sensor of course can broadcast

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,700
in the air about half a kilometer and

00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:21,530
can also broadcast over

00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,420
the LAN cable if necessary if you're at

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,570
a fixed infrastructure point and you've

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,820
got that capability very cool technology

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,130
very simple very cheap putting it all

00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,750
together the vision here is that you

00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,820
would have a disaster relief

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:36,200
headquarters you would have sensors on

00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,600
the ground and you'd have the drones

00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,850
picking up information on their own and

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,400
from the sensors to give you a fairly

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:45,440
complete map of a disaster zone at very

00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,700
low cost you could have one drone you

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,560
could have ten you could have a hundred

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,630
what we want to do is have something

00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,090
that basically allows you to have as

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,810
elaborated disaster relief response as

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,760
you need so putting it together ah the

00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,650
basic thing is that you need is a

00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,270
mission control again that problem

00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:04,610
fascinatingly enough was almost

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,560
completely solved the amateur drone

00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:10,400
community had most of the components in

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,860
place so a laptop a Linux distribution

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,840
or Windows or Mac it really doesn't

00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,540
matter running something like mission

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,880
planner from the ardupilot community the

00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:22,220
DIY drones community that allows you to

00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,290
put on the way points for the drones to

00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,590
take off and fly themselves and return

00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:30,260
home VLC player for things like your

00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:32,900
video footage and then having normal

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:35,390
disaster management software such as

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,980
Sahana Eden zahana Eden in case you're

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:40,250
not familiar with it came out of the

00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:43,160
2003 tsunami it's used by organizations

00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:45,830
like the Red Cross for disaster response

00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:47,660
it's very large quite complex software

00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:50,870
that allows you to deal with all of your

00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,930
logistics your GIS mapping of disaster

00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:56,990
zones and information reports our goal

00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:58,750
would not be to build new technology

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,370
where we could integrate into existing

00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,020
technology like that in essence you'll

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:05,780
have gathered the drones in the sensors

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,910
create GIS data they would pour that

00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,350
into something like Sahana Eden and it

00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:12,290
would integrate with all the other GIS

00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:15,890
data the disaster relief teams have to

00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:17,270
increase their response time so the

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,970
three cool things here the reason that

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,920
this is useful is that the GIS data

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,170
going into existing disaster relief

00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,290
gives a more complete picture of the

00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:29,240
disaster zone it simply adds a greater

00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:30,230
granularity to what you're seeing what

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,640
you understand is

00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,270
happened then that means your response

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:36,470
is better we're building it to hook into

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:38,030
openstreetmap with the interesting

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,360
consequence given that this can

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:44,210
recognize roads that we can rebuild

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:46,070
openstreetmap maps in a disaster zone to

00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:48,530
let people know where the new roads are

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,169
much faster than ever before we're still

00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:54,440
mapping on the ground the Japanese

00:26:51,169 --> 00:26:56,090
disaster zone for openstreetmap to try

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,120
and get a picture of where the new roads

00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,559
are it's it's taken more than a year

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,480
with this type of technology we'd hope

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,070
to reduce that time dramatically at

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,250
least four major arteries that the

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,410
planes could each easily see this

00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,510
technology is not designed to stand

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:13,549
alone it's designed to be part of

00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,370
something bigger to integrate into

00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:20,090
existing processes we're aiming not to

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:22,720
have any not invented here syndrome we

00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,390
don't want to do anything special to

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,730
replace any existing technology we want

00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,640
to fit into the existing technology and

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:33,650
expand the capability where possible so

00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,720
we want to work alongside openstreetmap

00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:38,210
we want to work alongside sahana eaten

00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,919
and indeed we are currently we're in

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,900
discussion with the Sahana eden

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,900
foundation but the Sahana foundation i

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,179
should say deciding how much of our

00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,710
technology will be built stand-alone and

00:27:47,179 --> 00:27:51,410
how much will be integrated in plugins

00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:53,540
to their disaster management for maximum

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,970
efficiency while also allowing people to

00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:59,059
use other disaster management technology

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:01,880
where required milestones are fairly

00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:04,010
aggressive will we hit the final one

00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,380
December of this year we hope to have

00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,840
the fundamental technology production

00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:10,340
ready the airframe it looks like we're

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:14,240
there the airframe is coming along very

00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,770
nicely the the software well we're

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,679
getting there a lot of the individual

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,360
components like loading up missions

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,090
taking missions off the planes and

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,520
getting it into things like Sahana Eden

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:28,070
it's coming along well it still looks

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,350
good for December we are not necessarily

00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:32,870
gluing it all together as prettily as we

00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:34,760
could so we might not have something

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:38,120
that's beautifully production ready by

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,370
December 2012 and quite frankly we don't

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:43,070
really care what we want to do is get

00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:43,970
this right now the reason our target is

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,490
so aggressive

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:49,520
is because the longer we don't have it

00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:51,320
ready the more that we look at disasters

00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:54,080
we see things happening and we think we

00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:56,540
should be able to help solve that but

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,400
yeah that's our target December 2012 if

00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,320
we're ready then awesome if we're not

00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,490
we'll keep trying we want to get it

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,860
right the idea here is crowdsourcing

00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:08,750
open relief is a is a project basically

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,390
it's a group of people who have a common

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:13,730
goal of improving our disaster response

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:16,160
based on the technologies that we have

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:18,140
knowledge of lots of different

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,300
stakeholders aeronautical engineers

00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:22,700
software people auto pilot people

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,170
whatever it's a community because we're

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,940
crowdsourcing and working on a

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,680
non-commercial goal together we're able

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,960
to get quite a lot done quite quickly

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,090
we're looking for more people to join in

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,220
everyone is welcome the idea is to build

00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:37,250
a community around the world that where

00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:40,310
possible turns the potential of these

00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:42,710
technologies into solutions for disaster

00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:46,100
relief and does it as well as possible

00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:49,280
so we're quite global already we have

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:53,090
people in the US the UK we have people

00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:55,790
in Singapore we have people in Japan

00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:58,190
obviously and Australia working on this

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,050
technology we want to be able to get

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,490
people all over the place to send us

00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,710
their requirements and to help us

00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,900
brainstorm the problems to get things

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,640
working we have a little ecosystem a

00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:11,480
bunch of companies or already

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,940
contributing technology time even on

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,390
some occasions resources to get things

00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,470
done so my own company opened on

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,020
underwrote the cost of building the

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,810
first two prototype drones code think

00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:26,630
made sure that we had some engineering

00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:30,710
time to get the drones completed we had

00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:32,630
toradex in Switzerland helping to donate

00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,810
computers in this case tegra two

00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,540
computers for advanced testing of on on

00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,250
airframe technologies nano dove course

00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,980
gave us the nanos for the radiation

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:45,260
sensor and that little model shop fills

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,700
model shop gave us the wires we needed

00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:50,450
to complete the drones when we were

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:52,580
stuck so this this little community it's

00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:54,740
just starting we need more people we

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,240
need technologists to help us build the

00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,740
technologies and refine them

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,679
there's a lot of areas where we don't

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:02,240
have the necessary expertise yet or we

00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,770
don't have enough of it because we're

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,679
all professionals and our time is

00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:08,330
limited we want disaster relief workers

00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,390
to help give us context and make sure

00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,429
that we are focused on getting realistic

00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:15,590
solutions and not just play with

00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:17,450
technology and engineering coolness and

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,920
we want commercial enterprises to

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:21,410
eventually put some of this technology

00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:24,470
into production we're actually talking

00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:25,790
about the first open relief product you

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,350
could call it where commercial

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,780
enterprise is looking at making the

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,059
radiation sensor either sometime this

00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,370
year or next year in which case it would

00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:37,670
be available for order for anyone around

00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:40,280
the world at a pretty modest price so we

00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:41,900
do need people seriously we very much

00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,850
need you and we have some areas in

00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:46,250
particular where I thought coming to

00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,870
this conference would be useful quite

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:49,970
frankly we've got a really cool air

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,190
frame I think nothing comes close to our

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:54,230
air frame in the world for this price

00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,990
point with this capability absolutely

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,929
nothing and we've got the basic tools to

00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,330
accomplish the tasks we were able to put

00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:04,070
the plane in the air take it back and

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:06,470
we're just about ready to send all the

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:09,820
geographical information data into

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:12,350
disaster management but integration is

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,210
really a problem for us let me

00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:18,020
illustrate this graphically because it's

00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,660
embarrassing and it's true so we began

00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:23,360
drawing lines to discuss our integration

00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:25,520
and how we could have what we called at

00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,800
the moment the drone manager to tie

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:32,600
together the various software tools and

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:35,360
make it easy for us to basically make a

00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:36,860
mission send it to a plane download the

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,200
mission from a plane and put it in

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:41,000
disaster management and we started doing

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,550
lots of this talk about restful

00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,120
interfaces and what different tools

00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:51,110
would work where and second iteration we

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:53,410
ended up with lots more lines and at

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:56,540
that point quite a lot of our our

00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:59,990
volunteers who aren't hardcore kind of

00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:02,900
you know passed out and what we have is

00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:05,210
a situation where we have immensely cool

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,220
technology that does need a little bit

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,380
of glue to tie it together effectively

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,300
and we do need smart

00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,450
Engineers to help us get that glue right

00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,700
because we are stuck at having big

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,500
diagrams and and we could we could

00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:21,110
really do with a hand on this to make it

00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:23,480
a lot simpler I know it can be a lot

00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,970
simpler it's just that this is all of

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:28,940
the stuff we need to do these are all of

00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,650
the tools we need to use we must find a

00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,020
way to put them together sensibly in

00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,750
modules that everyone can understand and

00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:40,010
further customize or further develop as

00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:42,470
needed ok so I be part of this that's my

00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:45,020
message we are here at open relief torg

00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:46,640
we have a little website we have mailing

00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,370
lists and so on you know join our

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,140
developer list to get up to speed if you

00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:53,810
want to help us communicate the message

00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:57,290
of this technology join the outreach

00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:59,420
list we're doing our best to do as much

00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,210
as we can within the context of our day

00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:04,760
jobs because all of us are volunteers so

00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:06,910
for example my my true moment of shame

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,870
is that essentially for two months I

00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,850
personally had very little time to

00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:13,730
contribute to open relief because for my

00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,980
my day job I was I was traveling

00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:18,560
incessantly I simply had no free time

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,270
and it's the same for everyone you know

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,909
everyone thinks this type of technology

00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:24,800
is useful everyone is trying really hard

00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,230
to get it finished but we don't have

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,240
enough manpower on a volunteer basis to

00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,760
do it easily and to do it as quickly as

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,129
we want so if you have knowledge of

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,800
software or hardware or both and you

00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:38,480
think you could help please do you'd be

00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:40,909
very welcome we're really open and

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,270
friendly community and we really like to

00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:45,800
work with people getting our tools

00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,960
getting our code it's really simple we

00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,540
try to put everything out basically as

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:52,730
we get it done sometimes like for

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:54,530
instance we have one programmer in in

00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:56,600
New Zealand who's really busy on his day

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,580
job to he's doing a lot of the opencv

00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,940
stuff and sometimes it takes a while for

00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:03,380
the new code to find its way into our

00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,850
repositories but basically whenever we

00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:08,390
get something finished we try and push

00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:10,670
it out so you can get our software code

00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:12,950
on guitar yes you can find some of our

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,380
electronic schematics like the radiation

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,290
detector on a solder pad which is an

00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:20,390
open hardware website and you can get

00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:22,160
our airframe currently on our normal

00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,360
website we're looking for a repository

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,240
that would be mad

00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:28,010
edged for this type of physical open

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,990
hardware that would be suitable to place

00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:34,130
these things on in the future if you

00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:36,380
have suggestions let me know so stay

00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:37,850
informed we went all social media on

00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,610
this to try and share the message

00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:42,830
outward because we're very aware that

00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:45,680
the actual target audience for these

00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:47,420
technologies are not technologists the

00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,910
target audience would be disaster

00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:51,710
responders people who can use the

00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,350
technology in the field so we want to

00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,270
try and ensure that we have a continuous

00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:58,690
dialogue about what's being built and

00:35:56,270 --> 00:36:01,700
why so we use Facebook Twitter and

00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:03,380
Pinterest pin interest you might like to

00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,180
visit just to see all the airframes

00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,220
we've got tons and tons of photo of the

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:11,180
build processes and the testing and so

00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:13,760
on there do have a look and you know

00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,470
perhaps most importantly do contact us

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,990
if you're not quite ready to jump into

00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,300
our development list contact me there's

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,240
my email address for open relief I'm

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:25,400
very happy indeed to speak with anyone

00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,620
about any part of our project and to

00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,080
help understand what you could bring to

00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,730
our community and how I can ensure that

00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,490
you get rolling on what you're good at

00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:37,040
as quickly as possible like I said we're

00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:40,280
very inclusive we're very open we're not

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,980
dogmatic we are doing this because we

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:45,140
think a lot of the open hardware an open

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,860
source software available in this area

00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:53,000
can help save lives and we can do that

00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:55,730
as a contribution of professionals in

00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,430
this field in a productive way in a very

00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:00,740
short time scale if we collaborate so

00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,110
our whole community the idea is we're

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,810
trying to get technology out there to

00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:08,420
help people to save people everyone is

00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,010
very welcome to join in we really do

00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,560
need your help especially on software

00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,120
and that's essentially it for the formal

00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:16,610
part of the talk though I'm very happy

00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:21,160
to take questions which you may have a

00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:21,160
couple of so ooh

00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:35,460
so any questions there's a gentleman in

00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:37,590
a green top edema rhabdo image and it

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,900
opened on your company was funding the

00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:41,400
initiative but yeah I was just curious

00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,970
where the funding was coming from if

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,800
that's disclosed to what the source for

00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:48,630
the financials yeah that the money's

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,240
coming in oh well there's been very

00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:53,250
little money spent I put about 5,000

00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,520
u.s. dollars into the project to buy the

00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:59,130
equipment and to get things arranged for

00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,140
the first two prototypes but apart from

00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:04,350
that and the donation of hardware by

00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:07,350
toradex and nano do and so on it's it's

00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:09,570
just been time for people now what we

00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:12,240
are doing with an eye to the future is

00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:13,950
we are setting up a legal entity to

00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,230
basically have responsibility for the

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:19,200
project because we do think that further

00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:21,060
down the line there'll be more more

00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:23,520
prototyping needed and that will require

00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:25,110
financial investment again so we're

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,780
going to set up essentially an

00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,240
association which can accept money and

00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,010
spend it on the project but right now it

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,930
was just the first few people in the

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:36,720
project put money into it to get things

00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:39,060
done so yeah my company put in about

00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,910
five thousand dollars to build the first

00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,640
airframes auto pilots and to pay for

00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:49,200
costs like showing it at the first

00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,080
events the as I say toradex donated some

00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,930
computers we had some donations from nan

00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,450
owed and the guy Eddie Strickland who

00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:59,760
built the advanced airframe also put

00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:01,710
money into it to finish the airframe

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,750
prototype but we're doing that is

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,760
basically part of our you'd call a

00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,530
charity outreach I mean it's like this

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,480
is money that we would donate into

00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:11,640
something like the Red Cross we're

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,380
donating it in here and there will be a

00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:16,320
formal legal entity set up for the

00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,090
future for funds okay it's good for a

00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,980
proof of concept I was just so in the

00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:23,280
future you think it'll be donation-based

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,260
that people will give to open relief and

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,450
then you'll be able to make planes and

00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:29,700
other reconnaissance tools and such open

00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:32,730
relief will not make anything it's a

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:35,460
design project so it will create designs

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:37,770
and release them what we will try and do

00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,990
is encourage commercial entities to

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:42,660
produce technology and sell it in the

00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:44,190
market and of course we want to release

00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,500
everything as open software open

00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,660
hardware so everyone can make it if they

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:51,720
want but we don't envision open relief

00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:53,850
being a producer in any shape or form so

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,980
open relief is a design project it's

00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:59,120
simply going to design and refine the

00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,380
technology based on knowledge donations

00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:03,390
getting into production of this

00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:06,120
technology would be too difficult too

00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:09,210
costly and too much of a liability this

00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,980
is this is stuff that is going to have

00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,560
an awful lot of variables you know the

00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,560
airframes alone the variables of flying

00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:19,260
them repairing them warranty we couldn't

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,480
we couldn't do this on a volunteer basis

00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,460
it will be inconceivable and we have no

00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,580
interest in setting up an open relief

00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,640
company for doing this now we do have an

00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,170
interest in encouraging companies to

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,870
commercialize the technology but open

00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:36,150
relief will only design and release the

00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:38,580
designs it's it's intended to be a place

00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:40,320
where we can get knowledge from all

00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,660
different areas combined it into

00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,910
disaster relief and put that out there

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,830
so that people can use it because we're

00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:50,730
at an interesting point where we can

00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:52,110
have intensely effective solutions for

00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,780
problems that we couldn't have done a

00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:56,780
few years ago if we get the right people

00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:59,460
in the right place sharing information

00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:02,790
once we do that its mission accomplished

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:10,100
thank you you're very welcome any other

00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:10,100
questions gentlemen over there

00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:24,740
okay you said you're interested in

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,400
companies to build your stuff but

00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:30,960
shouldn't the government's be also

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,690
interested in this and being responsible

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:40,500
for release of disasters do you get any

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:44,130
interest from governments or of you 16

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:47,010
interest from Japan all UK it's a good

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:50,940
question there has been no formal

00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:55,079
expression of interest informally there

00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,430
is a slight degree of horror from strict

00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,720
bureaucracies with this type of

00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:02,250
technology so for example in Japan

00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,640
virtually everything about the airframe

00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:08,280
and the communication technology is

00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,349
illegal because we have just gone way

00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,420
past all of the known boundaries and

00:42:10,349 --> 00:42:14,910
build something that's completely over

00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,210
the horizon of what they're legislating

00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:20,880
for so it's very difficult for them to

00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:23,789
work out what to do with this I mean the

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,640
airframe we have now is extremely

00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:29,039
capable it flies at 160 kilometers an

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,549
hour it can do a thousand kilometer runs

00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:35,819
it's very small very portable very light

00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:37,230
can hold 9 kilos of cargo it's insane

00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:40,049
technology and then it's got an

00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:41,940
autopilot that allows it to fly at 600

00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:43,799
three-dimensional waypoints which allows

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,980
it to do all kinds of crazy things if

00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:49,079
you wanted it to basically we're just

00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:53,039
off the reservation as far as

00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:55,230
bureaucracies are concerned so we

00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:57,539
probably won't see governmental buy into

00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,970
this technology in the first stage what

00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:02,059
we will see is disaster relief so for

00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:04,799
example i'm speaking with Team Rubicon a

00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:07,559
veteran Association for disaster relief

00:43:04,799 --> 00:43:10,339
in the United States and they responded

00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:14,309
to things like at the New Orleans

00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:16,890
disaster and so on they try to get out

00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:19,619
there and help normal emergency services

00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,029
and they come from the military so

00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:23,339
they're very well aware of things like

00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:25,140
drones and those are what you call early

00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:27,839
adopters that are looking at this

00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,720
technology and because they're very well

00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,520
known on a more

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,410
agency relief they're the ones that will

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:35,080
help with getting governments to

00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:38,170
green-light the technology in Japan

00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,230
we're trying to work with openstreetmap

00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:44,680
foundation japan once we have an

00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:47,890
airframe that we believe is out of alpha

00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:50,200
crazy testing we want to try and get it

00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:52,330
in the air in cooperation with

00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:55,900
openstreetmap foundation japan and

00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:58,060
perhaps a university or two in the

00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:00,460
disaster zone perhaps even in the

00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:02,020
radiation exclusion zone so if and when

00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:04,599
it crashes it won't do any particular

00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:07,330
damage that will be a process of

00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:09,400
essentially partnerships so working

00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:11,410
directly what governments is is is not

00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,119
what we're aiming at because they are

00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,700
very bureaucratic working with

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,369
responders is and commercial entities

00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,690
which are eyeing the horizon of three to

00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:21,580
five years in the future when

00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:23,650
governments get this and suddenly say

00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,690
yeah it's a good idea to have a thousand

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:28,270
emergency relief drones that can quickly

00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:31,270
map a disaster zone or another

00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:34,810
illustrative example in Japan we lost

00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:37,510
the East Coast radiation sensors in 2011

00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:39,700
it went dark what we knew was something

00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:42,220
was coming we didn't know how big we

00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:44,530
didn't know how fast so there was this a

00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,330
tsunami warning because it was obvious

00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:48,910
we've been hit by something enormous but

00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:51,940
all of our sensors were gone completely

00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:54,099
gone if we'd had the capability to get

00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,170
out there to send disposable drones just

00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,300
fly out and tell us what you're seeing

00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,280
and we don't care if you crash in the

00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:02,740
sea tell us what's there that would have

00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,300
been marvelous and I think disaster

00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,280
relief agencies with that type of

00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,339
message is what will help get this

00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:10,660
technology widely adopted governments

00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,270
will have to be dragged kicking and

00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:15,070
screaming into this era of advanced

00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:17,890
technology simply because they're

00:45:15,070 --> 00:45:19,780
concerned about things that are valid

00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,490
that dinner last night we came up with

00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:25,150
questions about things like privacy

00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:27,640
could drones be used to infringe on your

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:30,609
privacy other people asked could drones

00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,580
harm you hurt you like we see

00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:36,099
occasionally in the Middle East the

00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:38,349
answer is absolutely yes they could they

00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:40,810
could but so could a tape recorder

00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:42,400
infringe on your privacy and a fork harm

00:45:40,810 --> 00:45:44,319
you the

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,510
ones aren't the problem not really our

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,539
legislation is largely in place to make

00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:51,069
people behave themselves but governments

00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:53,829
are concerned about this new technology

00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:56,140
as they always are it'll be a process of

00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:58,859
discussion with reputable stakeholders

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:10,930
that allows them to feel comfortable

00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:15,700
okay any other questions yeah what also

00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:18,670
caused about the advanced stone the

00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:21,190
advanced drone yes it really depends on

00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:23,859
the technology being utilized so the

00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:25,960
advanced drone has a counter rotating

00:46:23,859 --> 00:46:28,779
propeller and the electric engine to do

00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:31,930
that is pretty expensive about 500 u.s.

00:46:28,779 --> 00:46:34,390
dollars that would push the cost of the

00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:38,640
drone well I mean pretty expensive 500

00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:42,250
dolla very cheap but it's it's about

00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,380
1300 dollars for that build but with a

00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:46,000
gasoline engine the price goes way down

00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:48,039
because the gasoline engines were

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,700
looking at they cost about a hundred and

00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:54,970
twenty US dollars so the target price is

00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:58,420
a thousand US dollars per deployable

00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:59,950
drone we can't guarantee the price but

00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,750
that would be what we're aiming to get

00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,940
the component costs with a slight margin

00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:06,250
for build cost in there a thousand

00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:08,650
dollars per drone is our target and it's

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,510
looking very realistic remember a lot of

00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:12,420
what we're using is really simple

00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:15,789
technology I mean aluminium rails

00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:17,920
plastic tubing a lot of it is very very

00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:19,690
simple and stupid technology it's just

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,230
we're trying to combine it in smart ways

00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,910
so that you can get these capabilities

00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:28,510
same applies for our radiation sensor

00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:31,359
that's you know that's a jam jar made of

00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:33,760
metal it's a very cheap technology about

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,609
twenty dollars per unit in any scale of

00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,829
production so you can expect the future

00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:41,589
to be very accessible a thousand dollars

00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:44,410
well it could still be a lot in some

00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:48,880
areas of Africa or South East Asia

00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:50,920
that's true we can't make it super cheap

00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,230
because you reach that point where the

00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,079
material costs and the survivability of

00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:57,239
the technology you can't go down

00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,799
any further so let's call it a thousand

00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,299
dollars and what we'd hope is that in

00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:02,609
the future it's easy enough for

00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:04,349
organizations like Red Cross to buy

00:48:02,609 --> 00:48:06,239
these things and to get them where

00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:08,130
they're needed so that the richer

00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:10,650
countries can underwrite at very low

00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:12,839
cost for them disaster response in

00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:19,680
developing countries that is extremely

00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:26,509
useful so any other questions a one

00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:29,849
gentleman up there hi I'm consultable

00:48:26,509 --> 00:48:33,809
communications when you send the plane I

00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:36,589
know 300 kilometers away and it breaks

00:48:33,809 --> 00:48:39,719
and crashes how can you get the data

00:48:36,589 --> 00:48:44,009
that's a really good question ah it

00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:48,769
depends where it crashes simple answer

00:48:44,009 --> 00:48:52,140
but yeah as the plane itself will in

00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:55,109
let's say the first generation fly dark

00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:56,579
so we envision in the early days and

00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:58,589
largely this is due to regulations

00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:01,140
around the world regarding radio

00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:03,420
frequency usage that the planes will be

00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,109
loaded with a flight plan they will go

00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:09,209
and they'll probably come back and and

00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:11,940
and that's what we're doing as step one

00:49:09,209 --> 00:49:13,499
because we we're well aware that around

00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,869
the world legislation is very different

00:49:13,499 --> 00:49:18,029
with radio frequencies so in the u.s.

00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:20,219
you can use 900 megahertz to speak

00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:22,499
across let's say 10 kilometers or 20

00:49:20,219 --> 00:49:25,079
kilometers in Japan that's completely

00:49:22,499 --> 00:49:28,559
illegal so first step we're not going to

00:49:25,079 --> 00:49:31,559
do that they're going to fly dark and if

00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:34,229
they go down you just will have to send

00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:36,150
some poor sod following the flight plan

00:49:34,229 --> 00:49:38,339
to eventually find the Machine and get

00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:40,229
the black box and and you know find out

00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,809
that it ran out of battery or gas or

00:49:40,229 --> 00:49:47,069
whatever the tail fell off again

00:49:41,809 --> 00:49:51,299
whatever the the future though is

00:49:47,069 --> 00:49:53,219
different and the insane gentlemen who

00:49:51,299 --> 00:49:57,170
built our radiation sensor Andrew Beck

00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:59,849
is also working on a concept for

00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,609
communication hubs and these

00:49:59,849 --> 00:50:05,009
communication hubs would be deployable

00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:07,859
throughout a disaster zone to restore

00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:09,150
ground communication for people but also

00:50:07,859 --> 00:50:12,809
for the drones

00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:15,299
a in fairly continuous contact via let's

00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:20,039
say widely accessible things like Wi-Fi

00:50:15,299 --> 00:50:22,529
or gsm communications because we can

00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:23,880
also do that so we're at the early

00:50:22,529 --> 00:50:25,559
stages of drafting up these

00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,960
communication hubs which would use

00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:29,760
things like software-defined radio to

00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,740
fit into the frequencies allowed in

00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,750
different countries and which would use

00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:35,880
things like Wi-Fi to restore basic

00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:38,670
communication for civil areas at very

00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,039
low cost so in the future the drones

00:50:38,670 --> 00:50:43,859
will be in fairly continuous contact

00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,900
with you as they go and in that case

00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:47,609
basically when it stops talking you know

00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,549
it's gone down somewhere and you've got

00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:52,740
a much smaller search area well we'll

00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:54,869
have to work out a beacon in the drones

00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:57,119
so that when they go down you can find

00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:59,910
them relatively quickly that's not been

00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,680
a priority we've been focusing on basic

00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:03,690
capabilities but a beacon should be

00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,260
should be there and it won't be that big

00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:11,279
deal to create a third generation just

00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:12,569
let you know we envision once we were

00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:15,270
able to build the communication

00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:17,190
technology on the ground hubs working on

00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,400
the drones carrying more communication

00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:21,180
technology and meshing the drones

00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,279
envisioning that it would always fly

00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,740
quite a few drones and they would mesh

00:51:23,279 --> 00:51:27,990
together to be able to create a chain of

00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,549
communication back and that would change

00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:32,039
the game entirely because you could

00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:34,230
repurpose them in high speed if one

00:51:32,039 --> 00:51:35,880
starts to malfunction you can replace it

00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:39,599
in the search grid but you can also

00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:43,049
watch it go down and then pick it up you

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:45,539
still send that guy out but it has an

00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:48,420
easier job so that that's it in a

00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:50,130
nutshell fly dark fly with greater

00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,049
communication with ground hubs and

00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,490
eventually have drone to drone mesh

00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:56,460
communication to allow continuous

00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:57,809
discussion but it's step by step by step

00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:00,299
and that includes waiting for

00:51:57,809 --> 00:52:02,099
legislation to catch up we often have

00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:03,869
the conversation where engineers want to

00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:06,569
engineer way ahead of what we could

00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:09,990
legally do and the answer is no

00:52:06,569 --> 00:52:12,779
absolutely not because we need to have

00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:16,289
real-world solutions that will be

00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:19,579
acceptable we can't break rules we can't

00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:22,170
break laws we must fit into the laws and

00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:22,779
still push the boundaries to get us to

00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,390
where we need to

00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:27,309
on the communication front so we are

00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:29,709
hindered by engineering but we're also

00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:31,359
hindered by the fact that legislation

00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:37,390
means we can't do everything that

00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:44,439
technology could do yet so any final

00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:45,880
question pretty silent in the room okay

00:52:44,439 --> 00:52:48,719
let's wrap it up thank you very much

00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,719
ladies and gentlemen

00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,260
you

00:56:03,079 --> 00:56:05,140
you

00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:08,010
