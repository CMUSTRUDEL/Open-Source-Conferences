will it be an introduction of the

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:42,270
session or shall I just stop that's good

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:46,950
I mean ready and we start ok welcome

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:50,370
everybody um I'm happy to to host this

00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,280
open discussion about open projects that

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,860
we want to talk about today thank you

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,350
for everybody joining here let me first

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,320
introduce the participants in this end

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,830
of discussion first ladies first of

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,750
course Lydia pincher she and I'm just

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,159
giving one sentence per person and

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,890
they'll introduce the project a little

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,159
bit so when I heard what she's doing I

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:18,240
would describe it as she is working on

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,540
making Vicki pedia even better through a

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,290
project called wiki Delta so it's all

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,700
about sharing information in the open

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:30,450
building the tools behind and getting

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:34,460
that community going then we have among

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:38,130
oka i hope i pronounced this correctly

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:41,070
he has built i think the simple way to

00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,189
describe it is he has become an Internet

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,009
service provider in spain kind of in the

00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:50,490
open started with a local project and

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:53,520
then brought basic to the people in this

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:57,659
local area to the internet together and

00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,119
then we have Shane Coughlin and he has

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,719
been building the open relief project

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:07,049
which was I think in reaction to to the

00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:10,349
tsunami that happened in Japan and he

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,450
has together with other people built a

00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:13,230
very interesting to will actually

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,540
hardware and so

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:21,930
where to to help in the emergency

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,140
situation all the helpers to get

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:28,709
pictures and data about an area after a

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,790
disaster so I'd like to start with with

00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:35,099
Lydia first tell us a little bit more

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,959
about your project and what what made

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:43,530
you start this project or what made you

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:47,720
participate in it you have to press the

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:50,670
button Oh Princeton now it's on alright

00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,680
so the project I'm working on as he

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:59,569
already said is called wiki data and

00:02:52,680 --> 00:03:03,329
it's basically building up a very large

00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:09,049
base of structured data that can be used

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:13,129
in Wicca peers and outside of them um

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:18,410
why I joined the project is because it's

00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:21,750
really really cool and it's gonna make

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:25,049
Wikipedia so much better and Wikipedia

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:31,290
as a project it's just amazing I mean

00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:35,579
it's the fifth largest website and the

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:39,269
only one of those that doesn't track you

00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:43,470
doesn't yeah dead let's say respect you

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:46,859
let's say like that so I I just think

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:50,459
that's really really cool what wikipedia

00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:52,950
has achieved over the last 11 years and

00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,660
you and you joined that project you said

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,030
so you haven't been the founder but you

00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:00,299
have been one of the people behind the

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:03,510
scenes creating this right so about

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:06,810
seven months now ago I joined the

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,030
project when it was started and i'm

00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,209
working at Wikimedia germany now dated

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:15,660
german chapter after Wikimedia movement

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:18,900
to build this so saying how about you

00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,060
and your project alright so I'm one of

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,039
the founding volunteers of the open

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,350
relief project this is a project to

00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,570
create tools that help

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:30,120
clear some of the uncertainty after a

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,790
disaster occurs so in essence open

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,920
relief is about filling in gaps in

00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,630
disaster relief as you mentioned where

00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,030
we're building hardware and software

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,580
together solutions which can be used as

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,950
sensors or reconnaissance in particular

00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,900
at drone technology we've developed

00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:48,270
which costs about a thousand dollars

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,310
making it the cheapest drone with this

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,080
type of capability in the world it's all

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,380
open source hardware open source

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,500
software the idea is to help disaster

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,480
relief responders do their work a little

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,940
bit better simply by filling in the gaps

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:05,400
in current technology in as open and

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,640
accessible away as possible this all

00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,740
comes out of the 2011 Japanese Tohoku

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:13,320
disaster where we had a very large

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,910
earthquake and tsunami and it really

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:17,340
taught us a lesson about how long it

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,380
takes to find out what has happened in a

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,300
disaster zone and yet we have the

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,580
technology to do it a lot more quickly

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,590
so we're trying to bridge that gap bring

00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:28,410
the technology to market a lot more a

00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,380
lot more rapidly than it has been moving

00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:34,590
so far and you said you're one of the

00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,750
your co-founder of that so I think we

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,730
can imagine what your motivation is it's

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,860
it's helping other people right that's

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:42,990
right I was one of the people helping

00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,120
deliver aid into the disaster zone in

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,700
Japan and it was striking that almost

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,440
two weeks after the disaster we couldn't

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,790
determine if certain villages were still

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,460
there or if there were people in

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,410
shelters nearby who needed help it was

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,360
just the scale we lost 500 kilometres of

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,150
coastline with water coming in up to 10

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,420
kilometers inland we were overwhelmed

00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,030
and the motivation of myself and other

00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:08,880
people contributing is that in future we

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,040
might be able to reduce the level to

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,220
which infrastructure is knocked down and

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,970
the speed at which we can recover so

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,550
it's very much a humanitarian approach

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:22,800
thank you Rahman about your project

00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,100
sounds very interesting tell us how this

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,550
came all together is we like to define

00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:32,580
or describe it as a bottom-up approach

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,560
for building the telecommunications

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,590
building the internet so in short

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,980
doesn't means is it it doesn't means

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,620
that we take the internet

00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:43,630
the delco operators as regular so we

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:47,620
take the lead as a user's as we create

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:50,080
an infrastructure so that's how I think

00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:53,170
it describes the project to make it

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,930
happens it needs to happen in a commons

00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:59,490
places also it means the infrastructure

00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:05,080
that we build is a commons kind of

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:07,540
manager network okay and your personal

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,610
motivation to participate in that was

00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:11,680
because your internet was too slow you

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:14,110
didn't have any anything where you left

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,510
what rights you there is many

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:18,910
motivations in because it's something

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,910
that I cannot do a long I need to need

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:25,330
to happens in within a community but in

00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:29,170
in my particular case it was because I I

00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:31,780
live in a rural area so in places like

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:35,890
that you have no chance if you want to

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,840
get a quality bandwidth connection so if

00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:40,450
you take the late and you do by yourself

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,850
then you can find a solution for that

00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:45,670
and actually in my particular case was

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:48,610
because of that but in many other cases

00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:51,820
maybe it's so in my case was because of

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,850
need I had no choice fortunately when

00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:57,040
you see in the cities maybe there are

00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:59,890
people who maybe can get the problem for

00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,860
a regular telco but maybe they prefer to

00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:04,840
build and still have control of the in

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,180
fresh to do by themselves because they

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,430
can get either better services or they

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,420
are not under control or somebody else

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,000
or they be whatever the cost is the real

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,090
cost is instead of whatever fee that

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,870
they'll go wants to make you pay for

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:25,210
okay so if I listen to that I think what

00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:27,370
is in common to all three of you you

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,050
started something with a common interest

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,420
either it was your very personal

00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,550
interest or you wanted to help somebody

00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,320
but there was an interest that was

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,870
shared there was a common motivation

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,880
there was a common idea and you grouped

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:41,650
together with other people now that

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,540
happens a lot you have all kinds of

00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:46,540
interest in groups some people do a

00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,400
cycle two together some people share buy

00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,760
some land to do gardening together

00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,840
whatever what made you decide to do this

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,460
in the open

00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,160
rather in the closed I mean you could

00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,610
have just locally talked to a couple of

00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,470
people and you know not going public on

00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,440
linux con and talking about the project

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,420
just make this a local event so whoever

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,240
wants to answer what what was the key

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,430
for you at the moment if you remember we

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,510
said I want to do this in the open may I

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:17,830
briefly start sure for us it was simply

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,530
that we're trying to accomplish

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,600
something that is extremely difficult so

00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,180
the hardware and software combination

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,120
for reconnaissance and sensors is an

00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,430
immensely complex problem and you can't

00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,890
know if you're on the right track until

00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:35,080
you get a huge amount of feedback from

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:37,630
technicians from disaster relief

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:39,190
responders from commercial entities to

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,470
let you know is this a viable solution

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:45,100
to solve a broad problem around the

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:48,700
world or is it a pipe dream so going

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,980
public for us was a litmus test had the

00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,840
proof of concept come up with something

00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,970
that is viable for the future so that's

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,950
why we went on stage in linux con japan

00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,660
and we said to the guys look here's

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,120
where we are here's what we've got

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,480
here's where we're going what do you

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,460
think so it was really about making sure

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,530
the idea was viable and getting a little

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,170
bit more help to bring it into a

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:13,450
production-ready state so is it fair to

00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:16,360
say it was more a the initial thought

00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:19,030
was a sanity check of external expertise

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:21,640
yeah I sanity check and a contribution

00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,740
call so you know is this crazy if it's

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,390
not crazy for goodness sake help us

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:31,060
we're trying to save people's lives here

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:33,310
good how about the other two um so for

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:37,240
we catered I wasn't actually a lot of

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:39,070
choice and I I mean Minear wiki's or the

00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,820
software Wikipedia runs on is free

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:45,850
software and building on top of that has

00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,270
to be free software too but building it

00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,130
in the open and not just building it

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:53,320
somewhere and then dropping it to the

00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:57,760
outside of course what's very important

00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,820
because you need the buying of the whole

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,460
community basically that this is the

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,530
right thing and that they are going to

00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,250
support it after we are finished with

00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,230
our work

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:11,470
and you only get this by an if you

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,230
engage them from the very start and

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,210
that's what we did right if I remember

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,480
your presentation with the light in the

00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:22,120
different geographies so if it would

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,860
have been the english-speaking community

00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,930
that would have created it or a smaller

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,880
group then you might not have addressed

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,490
the needs of other languages in certain

00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,370
countries exactly okay so to make it

00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:36,220
brought basically was your idea yeah to

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,470
make it broad and useful in the end and

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:43,650
because the open model of Wikipedia had

00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:46,210
worked out well right in our case was

00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:49,720
from the very beginning because I think

00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:54,460
that there was no other way to go for

00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:58,090
two main reasons I will say one is if

00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:02,700
you are truly willing for creating the

00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:05,590
network as a from from the user side I

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,180
mean an opposite I mean we are not

00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,970
trying to build private networks

00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,580
connecting ourselves so it means we

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:15,490
should be open like internet so we have

00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:17,470
to follow the original splitter let's

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,240
say there are other versions of Internet

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,510
but we want to keep the original version

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,690
of the internet so we want to be part of

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:28,210
it and secondly because as a citizen's

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:33,040
it went to truly become an alternative

00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:35,380
to big telcos every one of us can do a

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,870
very small contribution in terms of

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,670
infrastructure we cannot make any fresh

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:42,280
it will happen in all your country maybe

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,550
connect your home with your neighbor and

00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,280
and something like that and the the key

00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:51,550
point is to create everything so the

00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,880
only way to aggregate infrastructure's

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,640
is to make them happen as a Commons in

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,750
an open way so there is what there was

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,550
no alternative I think good one thing

00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:06,160
that seems to come out of that is that

00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:08,110
if you're solving a bigger problem which

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,820
is meant to affect a lot of people you

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,920
need to have a lot of people involved in

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,290
the solution if you're just solving a

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,150
problem for 5 or 10 or 100 people that

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,830
can be smaller but I think in all of our

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,990
cases we were trying to create a bigger

00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,850
solution

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:22,709
for a problem that could impact a lot of

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,430
people and that means you need to build

00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:28,470
a bigger community and so it's the

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:30,870
bigger brain power the bigger man power

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:34,800
you know that that helps accelerate a

00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:37,050
project now common interest the decision

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,300
to do it in the open was common to the

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,100
three projects to you how did you go

00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,279
public about it so the moment you

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:47,130
decided I want to do it in the open did

00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,800
you go in your local city and pin it at

00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,330
the Meijer board we're going to create

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,860
we're going to create a network here how

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,550
did you do it i would like to hear what

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,529
was your going public step actually it

00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,890
was very much like that because we were

00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:06,060
already doing the network as a citizens

00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:08,580
between us somehow in an informal way at

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,490
a given point we realized that it makes

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:14,970
sense to make it publicly available to

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:17,430
valid it's really when it really makes

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:21,029
it open truly in terms of because if not

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:25,010
we are private so at the game point we

00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:27,959
decided that we should publish comments

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,480
statement saying how in everybody can

00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:34,140
join and and all of this stuff so yeah

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,600
it was part of it and a given point and

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:40,260
actually it was funny because it was

00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,020
when the measure of the municipality got

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,730
connected so because we're getting the

00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,620
internet from the library of the

00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:50,550
particular municipality and said I

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:52,050
cannot do privately so if i do we will

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,329
because the measure of the municipality

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,190
was also one of those people who were

00:14:54,329 --> 00:14:59,190
not able to get the internet so

00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:01,800
everybody in the same village has to

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:04,890
have a chance to get in connected to the

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:07,050
internet only by the municipality so

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:10,140
lobbying is important in breathing the

00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:12,720
post after moving in small in a small

00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:15,930
villages in rural areas like ass I mean

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,690
it's quite easy because everybody knows

00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,190
each other it's familiar and so on when

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:22,740
you end up when you are approaching

00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,000
large cities and so on is so difficult

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,820
because in terms of telecommunications

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,550
there is also another loving who are

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,860
you know pushing for private

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:37,200
infrastructures and absolutely the upper

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,020
side that we are saying that has lots of

00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,000
power and money for spending in loving

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:45,630
in Brussels and so on so it's important

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,510
than the open community also is what you

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,930
say I mean it can be the openness can be

00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:54,150
applied to several subjects here we have

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:57,320
a very good example terms of software

00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:01,590
open source conference Lydia our data

00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:03,000
your what the Industrial Development I

00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,580
don't know how to call it but it's very

00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,490
interesting and in our case about

00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:11,220
natural investors so I mean openness is

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:16,890
a thing that really applies to many

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:21,750
subjects about your public step how did

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:24,570
you publish your project that is

00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:29,880
actually a good question so there were

00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:35,430
several projects before wiki data doing

00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:40,130
something similar so for example I think

00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:44,060
it was the first one in 2005 where um

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:47,360
Danny who is now reading the project

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:51,390
announced together with Marcos coach a

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:57,330
semantic mediawiki at wikimedia annual

00:16:51,390 --> 00:17:00,360
conference in a talk so in some sense

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:07,079
that was the first step I guess home but

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:09,990
Devon for for our project I guess there

00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:13,050
were it was a step-by-step project

00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:16,040
process of go a few main whispers here

00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:19,949
and there and I think the big one was a

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:22,230
news item on TechCrunch which inside

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:24,589
made me scream a little because yeah

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:30,600
getting so much attention so early is

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:34,620
dangerous um but yeah I think that was

00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:36,450
the big splash okay so there was there

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,550
was I would say at a particular

00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:40,050
specialist conference there was the idea

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:42,630
shared and the later when you had

00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:45,660
something to really start and used

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:51,050
a very well-known channel that everybody

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:53,460
is listening to in our case we started

00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:55,440
talking about going public after I

00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,770
reached a milestone of proving it was

00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,010
feasible the idea was originally muted

00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:04,590
around the time of Lennox con 2011 just

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:06,630
after the Toho Co disaster I don't of

00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,340
Lars is in this room perhaps not large

00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,590
as one of the people on a panel with me

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:12,630
where we started discussing this and we

00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,150
were saying that you know linux is

00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,580
really good on high availability server

00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,310
side and so on how can it be used on the

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,370
front line and the answer there was not

00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,860
really and you know that's where it

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:29,070
started and the idea of having drones

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:32,550
and this type of technology is blue sky

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:35,760
and impossible quite frankly so until we

00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,920
had prototypes operational and ready to

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,500
go in the air we couldn't go public

00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,750
because we had a big idea that sounded

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,790
silly but as soon as we had prototypes

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,860
that were functional we wanted to put it

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,630
out there that was our moment to go

00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,000
public and say to people will here you

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,710
go it can be done these costs about a

00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,900
thousand dollars to make an aeroplane

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:57,090
that can fly itself in map a disaster

00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,090
zone now let's get it production ready

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,680
so that was our trigger point but until

00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,690
that point it was a private development

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,150
it was a small group of relative

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,670
specialists to try and get it proven

00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:12,570
that we can build this technology in the

00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:16,050
real world ok so you have published a

00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:19,080
project it's out there it's known what

00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,330
were the first reactions both positive

00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:23,850
and negative I can just imagine what you

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,280
would do you did in Spain I mean in

00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:28,740
Germany there is a whole barrack for sea

00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,410
of giving certain bandwidth to certain

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,360
providers only and now here comes

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,940
somebody who is putting out antennas and

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,010
using frequencies out there probably a

00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,260
lot of people applauded another's maybe

00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,390
had questions and the same questions to

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:46,380
all three of you so he heard the

00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:50,370
reaction in our case mmm yeah we started

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:53,400
we went public and the problem is that

00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:55,610
from one side in terms of legal issues

00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,190
and so it's always a concern

00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:02,120
telecommunications but the fact and its

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:04,110
most same thing in gross all Europe

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,600
telecommunications has been liberalized

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:10,080
that since many many years ago ready

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:12,960
because of you directives that all the

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,670
countries have to be to follow right so

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,520
there is there was nothing wrong in

00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:19,500
actually what we were doing on the other

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,900
head in on the other hand internet

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,480
happens because of inter connection so

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,060
there is already legal rules around

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,340
there that are forcing the operators to

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:32,010
get interconnected between them and

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,780
that's what's creating internet so

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,150
internet is not owned by a single

00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,980
company is because of inter connection

00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:42,870
so we were actually just doing that but

00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,090
to be true i mean when we started doing

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:48,090
that we were not very welcome but the

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:50,820
others and this is a key point i think

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:53,820
also we were not welcome unless we want

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:56,310
to give a way to internet to them we

00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:58,830
should take part of them so it's very

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,690
important instead of creating a parallel

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,240
internet whatever because of privacy

00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,610
whatever everyone really defend the

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,860
internet neutrality and so on we should

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:10,170
be there be part of them we will not be

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,360
welcome to the to the others because

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,630
actually we are creating competition we

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,120
compete with them but we have to compete

00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:20,550
happily and it's it's funny actually to

00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,530
to fight with them so invite everybody

00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,760
to join and I think this is this is a

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:25,530
mood that shared in this room right

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,960
we're always in constant fight with

00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:30,240
bigger people and either on the software

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,429
hardware or whatever side but i think we

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,160
all like to fight that I think that is

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:40,200
certainly in common in the open source

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:43,710
movement oh yes um so we get it out at

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,170
the meeting got basically every reaction

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,850
you can think of from or yes this is

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:53,070
amazing piece can I have it yesterday

00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:57,240
too mmm too oh my god what are you doing

00:21:53,070 --> 00:22:01,470
to this is impossible um yeah basically

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:03,510
everything you can think of how about

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,520
your case how about building drones

00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,429
already right thinking what you could do

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,350
with them

00:22:06,429 --> 00:22:09,850
lot of people bill drones I think that's

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,490
worth pointing out there's a community

00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,980
called DIY drones with about 10,000

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,629
members but what we were doing was a

00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,249
little bit different because we were

00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:20,710
pushing the boundaries a lot further

00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:22,360
than an amateur drone we were asking

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,119
these drones to be purposed in very

00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,249
difficult environments and along the way

00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:29,049
we've we've pushed the technology out

00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:31,240
there with a current airframe which goes

00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:34,389
about a thousand kilometers under

00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:36,220
gasoline it can fly at 160 kilometers an

00:22:34,389 --> 00:22:39,399
hour it can carry nine kilograms of

00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:42,129
cargo this type of technology was out in

00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:43,749
the governmental sphere and quite

00:22:42,129 --> 00:22:46,119
expensive commercial sphere just a

00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:48,100
couple of years ago but even even when

00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,529
we launched in June when we had a less

00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,740
capable airframe we met with two types

00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,450
of response one was ecstatic wow that's

00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:59,200
so cool you're building robot aeroplanes

00:22:55,450 --> 00:23:01,629
to save lives which is cool and and the

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,980
other one was slight horror because

00:23:01,629 --> 00:23:04,749
people were saying oh my god you're

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,399
building robot aeroplanes that can spy

00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:10,840
on us or be used as weapons by

00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:13,690
terrorists both reactions are too

00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:16,330
emotional all we're dealing with our

00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:19,330
tools that can be utilized to solve

00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,789
problems sometimes tools will be misused

00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:24,309
sometimes tools will be used perfectly

00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:26,590
I'd say in the majority of cases people

00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:29,440
are inherently going to use tools like

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:32,529
drones for positive productive purposes

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,690
and sometimes people will misbehave the

00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:37,809
point is that the reaction we got tended

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,940
to be entirely hysterical in a positive

00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:42,249
way or entirely hysterical in a negative

00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,629
way there was relatively little middle

00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:45,789
ground where people said this is an

00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:48,369
awesome path it's going to take a lot of

00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:51,279
development and a lot of refinement how

00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:53,320
do we help thankfully we got quite a few

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,179
people who did do that enough that our

00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,149
development has increased in its speed

00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:00,220
but slight hysteria was the issue that

00:23:58,149 --> 00:24:01,779
we dealt with probably because we were

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,570
pushing a boundary something very

00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:07,169
unusual so is it fair to say from my own

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:10,749
experience that once you've gone public

00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:12,669
you have to survive the initial going

00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,850
public wave of reactions which usually

00:24:12,669 --> 00:24:17,889
is just verbal everybody has opinions

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,559
there are not many people contributing

00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:23,669
other than with words right

00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:26,789
opinions and I think many people give up

00:24:23,669 --> 00:24:28,440
you you have a great idea and there's

00:24:26,789 --> 00:24:30,240
always somebody in the world who is

00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,820
against it who has reasons why it won't

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,700
work legal reasons whatever challenging

00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,549
you so it's fair to say you had to have

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,669
enough personal interest you know to

00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:43,830
just ignore that and go on well I think

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:45,779
it's really important that you have a

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,269
vision of where you're going and that

00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:51,919
you're not afraid to essentially say

00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:54,749
thank you for your input you're wrong

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,429
that's it and you also must not be

00:24:54,749 --> 00:24:58,559
afraid to use your Delete key with some

00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:01,230
of the nonsense that comes your way so

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,139
you need to have a political ability to

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,210
find the good input and to survive the

00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:08,100
bad but i agree i think some of our

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,009
community got a little burnt out by the

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,259
wave of enthusiasm and criticism

00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:19,169
simultaneously just that energy is

00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:20,820
tiring yeah i completely agree on both

00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:26,220
the negative into positive can be

00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:28,830
harmful to your project but both of them

00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,690
can also be extremely useful for you of

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,690
course not only one hand the

00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,529
enthusiastic people can be the one to ya

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:40,049
take a message to two more people and

00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:42,419
the people who have doubt and tell you

00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:44,100
this is not possible only one hand show

00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:48,360
you where where your problems are if you

00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:52,470
don't know them yet and also get you if

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:55,460
you if you can do this push you to prove

00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:58,740
them wrong right um yeah you have to

00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,379
know how to do how to use them both of

00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:03,330
them it's not always easy yeah I think

00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:05,879
personal interest in a lot of pride is

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:09,899
involved in demonstrating the world you

00:26:05,879 --> 00:26:15,360
can actually do it often innovation is

00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:17,429
perceived as something dangerous and you

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,639
know the examples with drones that can

00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:22,230
be misused the ayah is a same thing

00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:24,779
happening to us in terms of net worth

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:27,720
networks can be used for good things for

00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:30,240
both bad things the key point and chain

00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,630
I think it was very good innovation will

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,180
happen anyway

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:37,390
if the drums will be actually we're

00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:40,150
there before and maybe also in some

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:42,400
cases misuse it in because of wars or

00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:45,250
whatever instead of being used for

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:49,510
relief purposes and like that and in

00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:52,600
what it has a common point of thing is

00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:56,230
that all things that are made with open

00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:59,830
source open hardware art or open

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:04,000
networks are tend to be much more social

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:07,210
social efficient friendly you know in

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,160
for not bad purposes are much safer in

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,470
general and take of course could be

00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,440
exceptions but I mean drones will be

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:17,560
there anyway regardless of opensuse not

00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:20,980
an open sewer will very much help in

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,670
making them be useful for nice things

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,190
that they were not used until now right

00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:31,390
cheaper and more available to NGOs

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:33,580
worldwide whatever communications

00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:35,650
obviously making that technology allows

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,800
people to do a lot of good and while

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,930
this criticism that someone could do bad

00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,980
that's the nature of humanity it's not

00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:47,440
the technology the next step so you

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,090
survived that wave and then from my

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,730
experience the next step is you have to

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,110
reach both users and developers right

00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,740
because you can share a common dream

00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:58,350
everybody wants to have this internet

00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,820
but somebody has to do the work like

00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:02,920
putting up the antennas doing the

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,080
cabling in the house doing doing the

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:07,540
hard work to get there on your side

00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:12,130
hardware or software so what is your

00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:13,360
experience in getting user interest and

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:15,310
what is your experience at getting

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:21,550
developers helpers people in the

00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:23,920
ecosystem that put it together it's one

00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,380
of our biggest challenges from now I

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,060
think that we didn't success completely

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,680
because it's very slow process and

00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:32,470
actually is about creating that

00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,050
ecosystem telling the people i think

00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:37,870
it's easy to capture the interest of

00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:40,030
users I mean it's very easy I have one

00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:42,070
cheek at home and it cost me less than

00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:44,200
you know just maintenance is less than

00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,780
10 hours a month so it's very easy to

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,210
capture

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:51,800
but it's difficult to happen and we need

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:53,480
to improve that and actually why I'm

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,870
very happy being here and trying to

00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:59,600
explain it it's actually our current

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:02,960
challenge I mean it's possible but it's

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,290
low it's hopefully in the near future as

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,260
long as we create methodologies we are

00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:11,150
providing better examples how to adapt

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,910
to every single country regulations and

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:16,340
so on we will we will improve so you

00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:19,190
have a lot more user demand and you have

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:23,660
sure people who can be sometimes I'm

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:26,150
very much afraid and I'm going there

00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,970
explaining things because actually we

00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:32,060
don't meet the demand but if you think

00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:35,120
in the good terms in in economic terms

00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:39,260
if the demand is greater that the first

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:44,600
so it's a huge opportunity so the matter

00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:46,730
of training professionals and and make

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,440
those economics happens it it tells you

00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:50,960
that it's possible we don't meet the

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:55,160
demand that's that's actually good

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:58,070
also i think in your case it's a bit

00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:59,780
difficult because it's the developer

00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:02,270
community is still pretty young right

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:07,060
yes exactly it's still pretty young um

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:10,910
but I I mean I i can sell two things um

00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:13,670
one thing is that especially if he just

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:16,460
start you have to do so much

00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:20,230
hand-holding and every single person who

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:23,840
comes to you it's what you will and or

00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:28,970
yeah nearly every one of them is the

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:31,730
potential future contributor and a lot

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:36,020
of time span elad but in a long run I

00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:39,260
think those first contributors or so so

00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:42,650
important and the other thing is what I

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:48,860
once again noticed now is that take

00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:53,210
lunch / todd & Co make horrible funnels

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,800
of contributors like basically nothing

00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,240
useful comes out of them in terms of

00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,800
getting you people to actually help

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,640
that's at least my experience

00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,240
you know it's it's an interesting

00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:09,380
challenge to try to produce let's call

00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:11,750
it an end product and for us we've got

00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,290
something that's very well advanced but

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:17,390
has a long way to go so I think as Lydia

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:20,810
said core contributors who really know

00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:22,490
their stuff are very important as you

00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:25,090
said demand if you've got a lot of

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:27,650
demand don't worry so much about

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:30,770
accelerating make sure you deliver right

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:32,270
so core contributors good vision find

00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,550
out where the demand is what they really

00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:36,230
need and build to that open relief is a

00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:37,580
design project we're never going to be

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,010
producing drones were going to be

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:41,420
designing and then releasing that for

00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:43,460
the market and having commercial

00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,610
entities and non commercial entities

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,590
able to build this all around the world

00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:52,040
we want to have the first airframe

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:55,370
technology formally released in December

00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:57,380
and we're on track for that but our

00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,510
priority isn't meeting an arbitrary

00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,480
deadline it isn't impressing people it

00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:04,250
isn't getting on TechCrunch we want to

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,320
get that technology out there to save

00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:08,540
people's lives if we can get it this

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,580
December in first generation so people

00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,550
like Team Rubicon or even the Red Cross

00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:16,340
can begin testing awesome if we can't

00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:18,590
okay let's get it right let's keep going

00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,560
along the way you'll disappoint a lot of

00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:23,510
amateur enthusiasts who want magic to

00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,460
happen right away or who think that it's

00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:28,130
simple to build these technologies at

00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:30,320
production-ready that's okay as well

00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:32,840
you're looking at a long term targeted

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,600
demand maybe the important thing is

00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:37,640
vision have a strong vision stick to it

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:40,790
and don't get distracted by the noise

00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:44,540
the enthusiasm or the criticism go for

00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:45,970
that long goal I absolutely won't want

00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,200
to go there in two more questions

00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:52,250
there's this one well step in between

00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,320
and so now you have contributions to a

00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:56,150
certain degree you have developed your

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,930
ecosystem the people who contribute

00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:01,970
pieces of it you even talked about you

00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:04,010
never want to produce something right so

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:07,700
it's it's more of a design thing so

00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:10,910
amongst your community and your own

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,050
opinion is it a problem if people now

00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:14,840
take what you have

00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:16,640
and commercialize that or not and have

00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,370
you taken any measures to protect that

00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,210
others just take away and steal what

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:25,040
you've done we want everyone to

00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,650
commercialize it as quickly as possible

00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:29,510
but our measure around that to make sure

00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:31,610
that the technology is available is that

00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,740
we use open source software and open

00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,290
hardware licenses so you can

00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,630
commercialize it but you can't turn it

00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:40,250
into proprietary solutions that's how we

00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:42,350
cooperate that's why we all as

00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,510
professionals volunteer and that's why

00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,460
it will be sustainable in the future but

00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,560
we want a commercial investment to get

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,300
the solutions around the world so you

00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,450
have no commercial interest yourself but

00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,710
you have yeah you're absolutely welcome

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:58,820
commercial success of these drones

00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:00,920
becoming absolute disaster angel for

00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:02,420
many many cals I mean what we did in

00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:04,790
terms of designing this was already

00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,440
aimed to push the price point way down

00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,720
this isn't about making young

00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,580
millionaires we're looking at a thousand

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,590
dollar drone with immense capability

00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:14,840
it's never going to be a high profit

00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,850
area but some airplane producers might

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,370
find it useful as an additional revenue

00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,500
stream I personally do not aim to

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:23,780
commercialize around this technology at

00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,190
this point in time of course if it

00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,960
turned out there was a huge market I

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,020
might suddenly be like Oh Shane plain

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,790
corporation if I go but again I'm

00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,169
likewise constrained by the open

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,200
hardware and open source software

00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:37,850
licenses this will never be proprietary

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,429
technology but it can be and should be

00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:42,140
commercialized by whoever can make money

00:34:40,429 --> 00:34:48,919
out of it and get it spread around the

00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:54,100
world um so it's free software so as

00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:58,880
long as people stick to the rights and

00:34:54,100 --> 00:35:00,620
rights and rules of it they are very

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,530
welcome to do so the goal of the

00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,480
wikimedia foundation and movement is to

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,000
bring knowledge to people if this

00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,940
happens for free fine if someone makes

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,900
money with it i make money with it

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,700
that's fine as well I guess so yeah the

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:20,510
end goal is important getting knowledge

00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:23,270
to people i like the question because

00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,520
it's important to understand some some

00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:26,440
people

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:28,120
have difficulties but I assume that

00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:31,090
everyone in his room will understand

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:34,420
perfectly that by keeping openness with

00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:37,030
certain assets like in our case is a

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:41,260
network infrastructure that creates a

00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:44,740
match a huge business opportunity to

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:47,500
others so in X sense because I mean in

00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:50,050
the case of Internet it's in other word

00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,180
Internet service providers so actually

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:54,220
the reality is that internet is in hands

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,750
of a few people that are making money

00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:58,990
with that regardless of the service that

00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:01,330
they are providing right so at the key

00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:04,120
point are you know professionals who are

00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:06,940
liquid to the territory and so on can

00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:09,040
make business on their services that

00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,620
they provided because people want and

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,290
professionals ones and the prices ones

00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:16,150
service level agreements people who with

00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,040
less than two hours will go there and

00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:21,520
fix whatever problem that they have and

00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:26,470
will pay happily because of that so by

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,260
keeping internet free as and in fresh

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,570
tutors as a common asset then it's

00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,060
important to understand that can create

00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:36,400
a match maybe a bigger a business

00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,710
opportunity and more let's say

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,980
democratic in terms that is not on hands

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:44,020
of particular you know guys and it's so

00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:46,420
everybody who wants to take profit of

00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:50,470
that business opportunities by providing

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,500
services will be able to do so great

00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:57,040
yeah so I mean for a company like Susie

00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,570
it's the same we are with the open

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,910
source community we are developing in

00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:03,070
the open source community at the same

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,020
time we are commercializing this product

00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,990
we are selling it which in terms allows

00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:10,240
me to hire a lot of engineers and have

00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,670
more people working on linux and also to

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,910
sponsor conference like this but it's

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:17,950
important it stays all open and in our

00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:20,710
spirit of Sufi we have to absolutely

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:22,750
want to want to give back and and I

00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:25,270
think this is this is then what what

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:28,000
brings you the Avalanche effect right so

00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,010
you do something you have a great idea

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,600
you started in the open and then you

00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:34,240
make it bigger and with that you can

00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,310
nurture even bigger projects more ideas

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,119
and other things so my last question

00:37:36,310 --> 00:37:42,740
that I want to ask you is

00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:44,869
about vision so some of your projects

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:47,450
are pretty young if you think out to

00:37:44,869 --> 00:37:50,210
three years from now that's not too far

00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:52,400
out I think what would be the ideal

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:54,740
outcome of your project and what do you

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,289
need actually to get there so this is

00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:01,579
also your chance to to ask the room or

00:37:57,289 --> 00:38:05,559
everybody who who lists to this what

00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:05,559
kind of help do you need to get there

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:12,109
well we are bearing issues we won one of

00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:15,589
Logan we have this internet for all

00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:17,960
worldwide as we are still too small

00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:22,190
aware as a community where quite big in

00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,769
terms of community virus but in time

00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:27,819
frame of tools three years and more

00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:30,940
reasonably what I would like to see is

00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:34,940
there are already communities worldwide

00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:37,309
so start cooperating much more actively

00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:38,749
between us and actually one of the

00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:42,710
pressures that we have we call it

00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:47,420
bottom-up broadband for Europe because I

00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:49,970
mean routine Commission was helping us

00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,920
in trying to move this forward but we

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:56,029
want to make it worldwide so let's see

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,430
if what a map broadband approach grieves

00:38:56,029 --> 00:39:03,259
and we start cooperating much more

00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:05,989
intensively between communities in two

00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:08,269
to three years hard to say but I of

00:39:05,989 --> 00:39:10,900
course would like Ricky data to reuse a

00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:15,369
lot in your gps and also outside of it

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:18,140
people doing cool stuff on top of it and

00:39:15,369 --> 00:39:21,950
on the only software side I would really

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:26,059
love for the community to take the

00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:31,369
software into their hands after we have

00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:32,960
done a lot of the groundwork for us the

00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,749
vision is not about technology

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:39,079
technology is necessary but it's not

00:39:35,749 --> 00:39:40,759
what we're about so the robot plane for

00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:43,069
example is what most people fixate on

00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:45,589
and it's largely irrelevant we're

00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:48,700
solving a problem of finding out what's

00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:50,140
happening and in two or three years

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,050
I would like a particular situation

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:56,440
never to occur again in Japan last year

00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:59,050
we found a gentleman on a roof almost a

00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,200
week f no just over a week after the

00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:04,359
tsunami alive around 10 kilometers have

00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,910
to see this gentleman was found by a

00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:09,730
normal Coast Guard overfly service in

00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,950
that situation he was the only person I

00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,230
saw who was found in the water days

00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:17,290
after the event a lot of people were not

00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:18,760
found in 23 years I'd like to see a

00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,770
situation where we can leverage

00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,720
knowledge whether it's hardware or

00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:25,450
software to be able to remap the

00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,030
disaster zones and get to people so this

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:30,880
will never happen again so basically

00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:33,400
that's what we want to do to close that

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,800
information gap and to solve that type

00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:38,500
of problem and to get there in that type

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,630
of time frame thank you very much I

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:42,490
would like to open it up now to the

00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:45,730
audience if you have any questions about

00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:47,260
what you heard additional information

00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:51,339
that you want to get from these people

00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:55,380
now's the moment to ask more about the

00:40:51,339 --> 00:40:55,380
challenges and advantages of going open

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:04,170
there's one question I mean we have to

00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,170
bring up a mic

00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:24,010
now we have to already know something hi

00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:28,000
I want to ask you said that you wanted

00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:30,820
to grow in quality not in quantity but

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,760
also where do you draw the line we're

00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:35,710
good enough is good enough I mean if you

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,960
were to just polish the design of the

00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:40,570
aircraft for example to a certain point

00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:45,360
it would just take too much time when

00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:48,220
it's when it's good enough when it works

00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:50,830
basically we just want to be able to

00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,840
have a reconnaissance completed if the

00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:55,690
airframe can do that and can come back

00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:57,910
and do it again it's done it's ready to

00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:00,520
go out and then further iterations will

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,110
improve it so yeah best is never the

00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,930
question when you have a project like

00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:06,820
this it's can responders use it to solve

00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:09,400
a problem and can they use it more than

00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,340
once and once you're there that's that's

00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,080
it you will do further iterations but

00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,060
we're not looking for best we're not

00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,370
looking for perfection we have no

00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:20,290
interest in engineering for the sake of

00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:22,480
engineering or technology for the sake

00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:25,210
of technology we're trying to get out

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,550
there to save people that said there's a

00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,830
lot of areas where we are really stuck

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,510
and that's where you guys come in so for

00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:33,310
instance software integration we have

00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,410
individual components for all of the

00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:38,080
things we want to do but tying it all

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,880
together we need help we need people who

00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,520
can code Python we need people who can

00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:44,290
help with user interfaces we really need

00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,420
a hand to make sure that disaster

00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:49,000
responders can use this crazy technology

00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:50,380
in a simple way and their minds don't

00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,680
get blown and they don't need their

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,210
hands held by super technical geeks but

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:57,120
yeah as soon as we get to the point

00:42:55,210 --> 00:43:04,750
where a disaster responder can fly it

00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:08,340
mission accomplished thank you do we

00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:08,340
have another questions

00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:18,440
okay then I think to sum this all up

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,079
three very different stories which have

00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,230
the open in common the thing we've gone

00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:26,980
through the the the common elements of

00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:29,359
it the common spirit there was a

00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,430
personal interest or a group interests

00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:33,950
to get there there was the moment of

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:37,630
opening up there were some challenges on

00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:40,910
the way there was relentless less to

00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:42,529
navigate through them and continue there

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:44,809
were challenges of getting more people

00:43:42,529 --> 00:43:47,210
and I feel the spirit is still there

00:43:44,809 --> 00:43:50,089
I've I find all three projects very

00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:52,130
interesting and I want to thank my three

00:43:50,089 --> 00:44:03,589
guests here today for for sharing your

00:43:52,130 --> 00:44:06,529
time with us thank you very much it's

00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:08,829
yours here yeah I think so thank you

00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:08,829
