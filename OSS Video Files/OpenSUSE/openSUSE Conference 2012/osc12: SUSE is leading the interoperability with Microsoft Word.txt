okay should we start excellent good

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:11,400
morning everybody and I'm happy to see

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:14,070
you here my presentation where I will

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,760
try to give you a bit of an insight into

00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:22,100
liberal office my name is Tom Valens I

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:27,930
work for Souza on the office i'm in the

00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:29,609
german engineering team there so let's

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,460
get straight into it what is liberal

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:35,790
offers some it's a leading free office

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,129
suite successor of openoffice it's

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,680
available on pretty much every linux

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,700
distribution our Derek's the standard

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,460
office yield of a growing market share

00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:51,780
very vibrant and active community I'm

00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,840
just here from four days of liberals

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,590
conference in Berlin if regular

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,719
time-based releases and the growing

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,359
number of developers are very healthy

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,369
and active community and the whole

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,630
product is geared towards solving

00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:16,920
today's interop problems so I would

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:22,560
invite all of you to try us and let's

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:26,790
look at some how downloads developed in

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,329
the past two years and it's actually the

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:33,229
just this year and you see you see some

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:36,390
fluctuation here but that's because

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:40,140
those Peaks that you see that that's new

00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:43,729
releases that's a press release big

00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:47,119
splash that we made and new release

00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:50,759
which happens two times a year we have

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:55,100
two major releases per year and a number

00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:58,740
of minor bug fix releases subsequently

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:02,219
you see the steady growth and this is

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,180
actually per week so the best week we

00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:09,829
had this year's of Horus more than

00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,829
600,000 downloads in a single week

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,540
let's look at developers since that's at

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,200
the end of the day but what makes the

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:26,740
product this is from the start of the

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:30,140
project in 2010 and you see the steady

00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:34,070
growth of the developed base that this

00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:38,600
little bright green bars on top of that

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:41,000
it's entirely new contributors which is

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:44,000
also really what you what you want to

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,450
see like new people coming in until the

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:55,400
project let's have a quick look at how

00:02:50,450 --> 00:03:00,620
the developer community is divided up we

00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:03,470
have a core set of people that regularly

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,560
hack on liberal offers many of them hate

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:09,980
a few of them volunteer but investing

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,380
significant time into developing

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:17,110
features and doing bug fixes cleaning up

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:20,390
the code with a larger number of regular

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:24,890
commuters roughly a hundred and

00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:30,230
sixty-one that the regular work although

00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:33,380
on a smaller scale they they fix mostly

00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:36,890
fixed bugs cleanup code and implement

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:39,860
small features and with the very large

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:44,120
number of occasional volunteers that

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:49,100
have the adhan 055 fixes five patches a

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:53,090
year some of them returning some of them

00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:59,110
just doing a few fixes and then going

00:03:53,090 --> 00:04:04,160
elsewhere to unboard people we have

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:07,850
so-called easy hacks which is a nice

00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:12,890
contained piece of work that people can

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:15,590
get into in an evening or two to two get

00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:19,270
acquainted with a project to get a first

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,270
passion and then grow from there

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,610
questions are forms so that's the the

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:33,830
community view on LibreOffice and the

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:38,810
the mechanics that we have that we tried

00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:42,080
to do that similarly to the Linux kernel

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,720
community so we have a very active

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,330
mailing list everything goes voy that

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,240
mailing list we are on icy weather

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:58,070
channel with a roughly 100 participants

00:04:50,240 --> 00:05:00,320
for for developing topics we have we try

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,350
to make it easy to contribute when

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,020
someone sends a patch we try to get

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:10,310
feedback to this page as quick as

00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:14,780
quickly and Isis as welcoming as

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:19,970
possible and try to get stuff either the

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:26,180
feedback corrected reworked or committed

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:30,530
to the code base within a week any

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:32,810
questions so far just shoot okay so um

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,700
now let's look at the product itself but

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,890
what does liberal office do for you why

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,890
would you why would you want to use it

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,790
those that might not have used it so far

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:50,450
just a very quick look at what it is

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:53,030
with your five applications to text

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,220
processing spreadsheet presentation

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,520
application at this presentation runs on

00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,580
a base database application and a

00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,390
drawing program now look let's look at

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:08,420
what they what they do Friday's very

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,310
similar in look and feel to the

00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:14,180
Microsoft Word imperil range of

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:17,440
functions and tools and features with

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,210
this very noise PDF built in PDF export

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,890
that's the works and all applications

00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:29,290
that for example oh so

00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:33,290
keeps simple presentations or keeps

00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:34,610
animations and presentations in PDF it

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,720
has a very nice feature that you can

00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:41,750
embed the native ODF file inside the PDF

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,850
so you just have one file that you can

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:46,220
send around everybody else opens that

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:48,530
it's PDF but if someone with liberal

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:52,580
offers happens to open that it's the

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:54,890
original editable document inside you

00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,220
can keep working on you don't lose any

00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:59,960
any information it's not that that this

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:06,580
law see PDF thing it's the original

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:13,400
document spreadsheet is well similar to

00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:17,830
to excel probably the only one out there

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:21,170
that has that have decent vba support

00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:23,720
yes and we open and save into both the

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:29,840
old and the new microsoft performance

00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,970
their presentation application of course

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,400
the usual microsoft import export but

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:40,390
also flash export and recently we added

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:44,030
SVG export even for the upcoming version

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:47,270
with animation so if you export to SVG

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:50,090
you open that in a browser you have most

00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:52,730
of the slides for animations there it's

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:54,770
very nice to just take your take your

00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:56,030
presentation go to some conference you

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,580
don't know what's installed there i'll

00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:05,990
just stay in the USB key and there you

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:10,100
go base as well designed with microsoft

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:14,120
user in mind and to draw a drawing

00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:18,140
application very nice recent feature

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:21,850
addition there is a physio cold raw and

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,850
Microsoft Publisher import

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:33,229
so just a few screenshots to give you an

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:36,080
impression what does it's really feature

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:41,680
wretches probably though the most

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:48,200
feature complete free or open-source

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:50,930
office suite that you can find to see

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,170
here is the vba macro that's analyzed

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:58,070
emo that runs in the spreadsheet with

00:08:54,170 --> 00:09:00,589
its in fact a vba macro that draws nice

00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:13,130
things and that runs like it runs an

00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:18,020
axial impress the import the reasons Oh

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,760
XML files from Microsoft we support most

00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:25,480
of the features there including the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,480
SmartArt drawing Decker audit

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:42,070
and a few sorted screenshots here for

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:44,740
you this is the vco employed so there

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:50,050
are many people that do the drawings the

00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:52,660
diagrams in v's you that some so as far

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,690
as i can tell that's the only free

00:09:52,660 --> 00:10:02,800
office or free software solution that

00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:07,839
has this quality with a VZ employed some

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:12,790
usability fixes improvements that we

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:16,000
added in the past year just to make it

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:18,670
easier to make things features more

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,680
accessible to users with not only

00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:25,060
interrupt that we focus on what i was a

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:27,790
usability look and feel fixing the

00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,200
so-called paper cuts little annoyances

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:36,670
that people stumble across and we try to

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:48,430
get right and others didn't get right

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:51,700
for many years so what does Doozer have

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,140
to do with all of that well sousa not

00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:58,630
only is a significant part of the

00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:03,330
Liberals project and then the governing

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:07,540
entity which is the document foundation

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:11,710
we are also offering service and

00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:16,300
maintenance for our customers so there

00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:18,760
say there is a souza version supported

00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,910
souza version of the office that you can

00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:26,170
get for not only Linnets but also for

00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:29,110
windows and depending on your size and

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,320
your requirements into demands mafer

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:37,290
think very very interesting offering

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,290
their ticket to a

00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:51,280
a very nice compelling secure way to

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:54,040
deploy a free free office suite that

00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:57,340
includes monthly updates and patches

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,770
that includes phone support and email

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:03,850
support and that includes fixes so if

00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:06,340
you have a problem you have a document

00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,460
that doesn't import correctly you have a

00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,940
book you want to fix then you're

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:16,570
entitled to support so the lib refers to

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,680
the liberal office team is there to to

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:25,020
fix that and you will get a special

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:30,000
fixed product before everybody else and

00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,000
yeah that's our our value proposition

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:39,970
beyond that of course that the the

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:42,220
diversion is pretty much the same as so

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:43,780
that we don't withheld any features

00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:48,520
that's very much pretty much the same

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:51,430
version you get as the the free one but

00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:55,120
you get the service on top and you get

00:12:51,430 --> 00:13:00,160
fixes that you that might be critical to

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:04,180
your needs so what were you here for is

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:09,160
to help you succeed with libero office

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:13,210
and I would be thrilled to to tell you

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:17,890
more maybe um after the talk or in the

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:22,990
hallway just just poke me my my email

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:27,160
address what was on the first slide it's

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:29,640
a key barons de Souza com I just just

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,640
ask me

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:33,180
so

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:27,740
but usually there's some middle ground

00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:30,860
here so what we can do is support a

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:33,709
feature that it looks the same it looks

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,980
correct and we can of course provide

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:40,009
different means it's not that we are on

00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,629
where we want to be in exact clone so

00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,809
when we when there is a feature that we

00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:48,139
saying this nice and important we added

00:14:43,809 --> 00:14:51,170
on top so for example of styles concept

00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:53,509
that that's been in the office open

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:56,569
office for for many years that's clearly

00:14:53,509 --> 00:15:01,180
superior to to what the Microsoft Office

00:14:56,569 --> 00:15:01,180
has it is most often

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:25,380
but but this is how usually there's a

00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:29,250
middle ground so you can always have a

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:30,990
flag or a I want this I wanted this so

00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,930
for example the writer application is

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,490
lots of those compatibility options like

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,880
the here comes a document that was

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,210
originally word 97 that gets imported

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,360
and the the application knows all word

00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,910
97 has quite some quirks so it sets a

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,810
number of compatibility flags that do

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:54,780
get round trip that do get saved in

00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:56,700
audio files so that you get the same

00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,950
layout but that doesn't mean that this

00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,020
is a default if you create a document

00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,930
from scratch you don't have those compat

00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:11,810
features too and on most of the time you

00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:11,810
can work around that yes they are

00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:43,500
so that there is a very easy answer to

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:46,490
that question and this is please just

00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:49,140
try it go to Liberal office dot org

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:52,290
download the latest version load your

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:55,470
documents and see how how it looks does

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,680
it work or not we for VBA we don't have

00:16:55,470 --> 00:17:02,790
one hundred percent we we focus for VBA

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:05,730
we focus on them the problems that most

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:10,050
often occur and then the majority of the

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:14,209
documents that means probably advanced

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:14,209
features might not work yet

00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:13,350
yes I know it's it's somehow differently

00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:17,460
different focus that's it's a vector

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:20,850
drawing application by design so you can

00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:24,210
import physiol files but it's not that

00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:27,659
you have the exact same functionality

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,970
there so it's it's an import in the

00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:31,890
sense of the world like you it looks the

00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:37,770
same but it doesn't necessarily behave

00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:40,320
the same but um well for the most it's

00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:42,750
um just to get the graphics and I mean

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,250
that's that there are billions and

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,309
billions of physio documents where

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:49,590
someone has designed some or chart or

00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:51,539
something and just being able to import

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,820
them we use the graphics for you for

00:18:51,539 --> 00:19:01,200
your text for for your MIMO or for your

00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:04,919
presentation it's really nice ok any

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,880
further questions and please still come

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:12,090
to us and ask and we're glad to show you

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:18,140
and then also talk about whatever you

00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:20,660
want to know pricing everything ok

00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,820
thanks so much for being here thanks

00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,510
much for your attention looking forward

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,510
