I have to tell you something about the

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,189
school system in Austria to understand

00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:52,460
what you are doing and how the project

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:55,590
is working the first of all our students

00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:59,159
has to go to primary school at the age

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:02,969
of six years up to 10 years and then

00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,790
they can't decide to go to the secondary

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:08,970
academic school or to the lower

00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:14,150
secondary school until age of four teens

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:17,760
they can decide to go to the egg

00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:22,970
secondary school upper cycling / to a

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:26,480
type of v ET college ave e ET school is

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:31,980
VT is vocational education and training

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:35,880
or the other possibility is to go to a

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:43,950
prospective ship training and vocational

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:47,070
school the main is now that there exists

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,350
an agreement between the federal

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:53,220
government of for education in Austria

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:57,690
with Microsoft it's only a rental and

00:02:53,220 --> 00:03:01,680
upgrade license that means you have to

00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:04,770
buy a new hardware with an operating

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,209
system a licensed operating system from

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:12,450
Microsoft and then you are allowed to

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:18,090
install the latest version of the

00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:20,660
Microsoft products we get twice a year

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,720
the package of the new microsoft

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:27,989
products for a teacher in pupils and

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,080
students it is possible to get in work

00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:34,380
at home license and the costs for this

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:41,840
agreement is two million five hundred

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,840
thousand euros a year okay that's it

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:50,850
good till yet and now the more important

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,610
thing is that this agreement is only

00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:57,269
valid for the schools who are not

00:03:53,610 --> 00:04:02,820
colored in red yeah not colored in red

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:06,320
and let's this is the school tab where I

00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:09,860
teach yeah I'm teaching the secretary

00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:15,810
academic school and in the upper cycle

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:19,669
and we have the microsoft products in

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:24,770
our school and a lot of colleagues are

00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:28,610
telling me there is no reason to teach

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:31,759
other software then Microsoft products

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,970
yes they teach microsoft windows

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,550
operating system and weird that's the

00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,460
most important thing to teach yet even

00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:44,629
the school books you look in and they

00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:49,490
sent and reach please start work and go

00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:53,360
on with you with the resin so you can

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:57,460
see it is very hard to place an open

00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:02,539
source product in these types of schools

00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:05,060
and now I told a lot of stuff and the

00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:08,960
question is what is desktop education

00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,949
and what is self-education test

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:16,460
communication is a free workstation for

00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:22,310
students for all types of schools in

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:26,539
Austria and it is easy to install we as

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:30,710
you see later on we made a DVD or an

00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:34,159
either and you can install it and the

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:44,090
server for education is placed on the

00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:52,250
same d ed we are using as you see suse

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:58,449
linux since 1997 we started with with

00:05:52,250 --> 00:06:04,550
suse linux 5.18 a web server and we

00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:08,810
bought all these boxes and installed

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:11,630
these versions on our service we had

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:15,919
installed up tools installed up to 16

00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:20,289
servers in our school and now let's have

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:23,960
a look at the history of this project i

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:26,150
had just ten years ago headin novel

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,819
server hit my school and had a web

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:33,270
server I had the user on the novell

00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:36,930
server had users on the on a web server

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,180
it's very good to change password oh

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:44,970
I've forgotten to change the password

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:50,420
and on this system so and i remember at

00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:54,360
june 2003 my novels were crashed and now

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:59,780
what what did how to do i decided in

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:03,150
summer 2003 to create my own sarah and

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:08,250
at the beginning of the school year 2003

00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:12,930
I had a server because I found in

00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:15,740
internet a ready-made solution called

00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:20,010
slicks if anybody knows this project

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:23,570
stick server I download it to cities

00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:27,660
installed and my server was ready made

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:30,840
we used this server just for two years

00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,240
because the problem was this sir was

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,090
only a domain controller for Windows

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:42,750
clients i won I always wanted to have

00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:49,320
linux plans connected to this java and

00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:53,220
so we started m2 in 2005 with the first

00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:58,890
version where we changed the city one of

00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:05,370
the sauce a 99.3 we installed there in

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:08,400
August but XML and then you put on the

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:11,810
other five DVDs in your head the first

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:19,800
server and desktop dedication installed

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:24,500
next is 2006 you see son has powered

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:30,590
this project and our federal government

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:35,030
for education and it's further on in

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:44,250
2006 and your version of this project

00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:48,259
2008 2010 2011 and 2012 and now we are

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:58,620
developing developing the next version

00:08:48,259 --> 00:09:01,170
2013 in in the year 2009 the Australian

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:05,310
Ministry of Education made in Europe

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:09,380
right call for tender therefore we

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:14,490
joined to kcs competence cluster cells

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:20,339
it's located in our area and we take

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:23,819
part on this call everyone and so for

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:29,490

implement printer and so on and the last

00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:12,439
thing is if you don't want to do all

00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:14,749
these things you are not able to if you

00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:19,189
want to do not to these things you can

00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:22,160

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:36,009
not three from nativities we already

00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:41,899
spread about 16,000 X apply as a species

00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:46,189
ok the next thing with is one of this

00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:53,600
company you can invite and this company

will install and install your desktop

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,439
and server education

00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:06,959
so as hell no told you before the

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,420
desktop fabrication is a free and open

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:14,430
source workstation for students from

00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:17,940
elementary up to secondary school we its

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:23,519
current currently based on Suzy 12-1 but

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:27,569
we're working on 12 to its yeah not it

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:30,959
won't take long yeah the great advantage

00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:33,990
we against other competitors is that we

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:37,560
have a automatic or semi-automatic

00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:39,449
installation I'll come to that and we

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,930
have a lot of software pre-installed and

00:14:39,449 --> 00:14:45,980
pre configured as I told you the

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:48,360
installation is semi-automatic why

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,959
semi-automatic because we had some

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:54,089
issues with full up oops with full

00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,220
automatic installation like people

00:14:54,089 --> 00:14:58,800
coming to us a great product and

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,410
everything but it's somehow trashed my

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,529
other partitions and yeah so it's

00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:07,620
semi-automatic you can choose on full

00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:10,680
installation go erase or hard drive and

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,910
everything or side-by-side with other

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:17,160
Linux or other windows installations and

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:20,899
you can also choose to set up a

00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,639
standalone version or that our

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:27,089
connection to a server like server like

00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:31,290
ours or of education or Windows Server

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:34,470
something yeah the software we install

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:37,410
is automatically configured as the right

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:41,399
of the installation or by all done by

00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:44,310
auto just XML files so you can also copy

00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:48,149
the xml file and user other other

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,970
installation media and it's designed to

00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:54,029
be suitable for inexperienced users it's

00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:58,110
also you know regular teachers and

00:15:54,029 --> 00:16:01,889
everything don't know how to do computer

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:06,259
so how they just know how to turn on and

00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:08,560
and so they just put a DVD in and

00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:12,610
hopefully it works

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,410
yeah and if you already have a existing

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:19,380
infrastructure you can also insert via

00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:22,090
pxe you just boot from the servant yeah

00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:25,930
installation the installation DVD boots

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:27,520
up like this is at internment but yeah

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,550
we're working on english worst version

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:33,190
it's booting from from hard-disk

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:36,220
installing desktop education is ring

00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:41,020
serve of education in sterling terminals

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:44,830
of education that's another feature with

00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,630
us we'll hope you tell you over and key

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:50,500
awning for cloning and deployment you

00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:56,830
have UDP cast console and stuff like

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:58,480
that so it's quite the normal openSUSE

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:01,180
installation screen except for

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,460
everything is is prefilled out for you

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:06,579
so I don't have to do anything just

00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:10,140
click on install you have to do one

00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:13,420
thing we include the flash player and

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,310
flu endo mp3 plug in so you have to

00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,120
accept these licenses if you want them

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:24,100
if you don't ya just decline until don't

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:28,720
get on and then installation with quite

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:34,000
a nice looking put a diode show then

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,890
hopefully you get to this bill yeah what

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,110
so now what do you do what do we do with

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:40,330
this nice-looking desktop with the funny

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,770
little penguin and entering of course we

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:47,170
have a lot of software it's a lot of

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:51,880
popular open source software like

00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:54,460
blender or leave office or audacity

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,620
something like that and of course we

00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,490
added some other software mainly for

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:04,780
educational purposes yeah and it's all

00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:07,600
set up and ready to run yeah there you

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:11,890
can see libre office inkscape eclipse

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:16,330
the stuff most of you will know this is

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,570
g gear bruh it's quite popular and quite

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:22,330
popular in austria

00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:26,020
it's a dynamic dynamic mathematics and

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:27,790
geography tour so we can put points and

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,550
surgeries and everything and drag them

00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:34,140
around and see how this influences the

00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:38,740
formula and everything so this is I talk

00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:42,610
that's a quite nice program for scores

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:46,480
without projectors or anything you can

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:51,360
it's a it's there's a teacher client

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:54,460
under and the student kind so to say and

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,760
the teacher can protect his screen

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,800
overall the student screens or lock the

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,560
student screens if they don't listen or

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:05,890
something and he can also control what

00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,440
the students do so just so if they

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:13,630
really learn or just your facebook or

00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:18,520
anything let's open shot it's a quite

00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:21,700
nice video editor I think it's in the in

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:24,130
the normal pac-man pac-man sources for

00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:28,630
Souza but yeah we thought it would be

00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:30,790
nice and it's teen or tip 10 or

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:34,030
something it's a brought a German

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:37,120
program developed in Berlin it's for

00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:40,450
learning the for learning to write on

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,700
the computer it's mainly for German

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,100
layouts but it can be configured for

00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:49,750
other layers as well English and to our

00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:55,000
hack and everything so it's kew cut its

00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:58,780
hadn't it's a competitor to 2d CAD

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,790
software like autocad or something but

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:08,080
it will be replaced by Levi cut in the

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:11,710
next version yeah that's another another

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,940
one we re really like it's maxima maxima

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:19,530
and it's a great tool for mathematics or

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:24,040
something it's direct competitor to the

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:26,410
commercial tour mathematical it it's

00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,810
great in in connection with new plot it

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:31,570
can plot and do everything and derive

00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:37,110
and integrate and yeah

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:40,450
about everything so sorrowful occasion

00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:43,020
okay thank you very much the test of

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:47,020
education includes a lot of software

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:49,990
more than one gigabyte and education

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:53,380
software and now deserve education it's

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,740
also based on opensuse at this version

00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:01,840
at it's based on 12 dot one but the

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:05,230
development with based on 12 taught to

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:09,330
is still in process it's on my notebook

00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:16,180
if you want to take a look you can do it

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:18,610
I and lots of things to to every version

00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,890
you have to check if the outdoors is

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:25,690
still running the ldap server is still

00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:30,340
running and so on but we managed it each

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:32,440
times but not deserve education as i

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:37,960
already said it's also based on opensuse

00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:42,160
we are very proud that we are using Susa

00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:45,790
you're a lot of a long time ago and the

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:51,160
outer just allows us very very simple to

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:55,000
install a server or a client as we

00:21:51,160 --> 00:22:00,000
really like we write it in our xml file

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:07,870
and the result is exactly what we want

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:10,030
to serve education is yeah our proud

00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:12,520
project it's for qualified domain

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:16,660
controller so you can easily connect

00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:19,720
your windows clients to this server but

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,960
is also a full two main controller for

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:25,810
the linux clients and the mexicans you

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,050
can have a safe connection between the

00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:33,040
server and the clients let's just read

00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:37,270
right NFS success it's very secure so

00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:40,290
the students can't tell or remove files

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:45,410
from other students or from the teacher

00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:48,890
and we also developed I've developed

00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:52,490
unjust motors we are very proud about

00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:56,120
this development because now it's very

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:59,810
very easy to configure the server you

00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:02,060
just have to add new groups add new

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,120
users and new network shares and

00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,580
everything is done you have a server

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,320
which is a file server which is a

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,350
database server which is a web server

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:15,110
print server then s server database our

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,290
proxy server and so on and so on the

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:27,980
list is very long and everything is done

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:29,690
if you use our for new just motors the

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,290
screenshot is also in German because

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:36,460
it's Austrian project and mainly used in

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:42,050
Austria but we also have installations

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:47,290
outside Austria you will see there maybe

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:50,900
you see there is a server management

00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:54,320
motor and a group management motor and

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:58,760
the user management group motor and a

00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:02,420
network share motor and also a client

00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:07,700
management tool so you easily can manage

00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:13,400
your whole system with just this August

00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:15,020
movers so take a look at each motor at

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,750
the end of the installation of the

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:23,120
server education it's semi-automatically

00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:27,560
you get these questions you have to

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,930
insert the domain name or the host name

00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:33,380
of the new server that's very important

00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:36,710
for the windows clients they have to be

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:41,140
in a domain that everything is working

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:45,740
and you have to set your own network

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:50,240
configuration or we also filled this

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:53,090
filter out you can just click Next and

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,000
you have the network setting as we have

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:59,210
pre configured for you but you can

00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,720
easily change this free

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:06,380
fields and you have your own network

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,520
configuration you can easily start or

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:14,080
stop the DB server and set a nest server

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:19,250
just click on this button and you have

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:21,770
full network or not ok that's the

00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:25,880
network configuration everything if you

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:29,299
use proxy servers or etc you have to do

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:34,669
a lot of more things but that's normal

00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:36,740
enough ok now you have to add new groups

00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:39,799
in your score you have teachers you have

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,860
students you have students with other

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,529
rights than other students and so on and

00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:48,980
you have students who have already

00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:52,990
leaves to school and you have some

00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:57,649
special users who are adminstrator

00:25:52,990 --> 00:26:01,029
so-called rotten peanut they have more

00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:04,659
rights than others users in the system

00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:07,880
you just have to click add new group and

00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:11,840
set the name and that's done and it's

00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:15,799
all are stored in a local ldap server

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:18,200
open ldap server and every component is

00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:22,960
working together with this open ldap

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:27,320
server now you have to add a new user

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:31,070
that's also a own estimate or you just

00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:35,450
have to say ok new user fill in the

00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:39,220
fields you username which grouped this

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:42,679
user is and set the password and

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:45,409
everything is done so we will create a

00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:48,350
new home director for this user web

00:26:45,409 --> 00:26:57,230
server will be configured with this new

00:26:48,350 --> 00:27:01,730
user and so on at the end you find so

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:05,419
looking at the end you will get a long

00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:08,450
list of all your users in the school you

00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:12,740
can also set if the user can change

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,340
their passwords by themselves or the

00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,520
atmosphere

00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:23,840
it'd have to set the password and you

00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:27,890
can choose if the user profiles are each

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:31,910
person has its own remote user profile

00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:36,250
or has it as a group so each student has

00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:39,080
the same profile or individual profiles

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,240
you just have to click here in the last

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,580
module and everything is done you don't

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:49,750
have to do anything on the clients or on

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:53,660
the server anymore okay and you also can

00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:58,310
import your existing users from a CARC

00:27:53,660 --> 00:28:02,930
sheet you just have to edit file select

00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:06,050
add the file and all your users are in

00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:11,180
the system and you don't have to do

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:14,480
anything else and now to the next just

00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:16,160
motor it's for network shares that's

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,910
very important for schools and for

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:22,760
companies you have to work together with

00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:28,490
other people or to share documents and

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:33,440
videos and pictures and that's very very

00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:36,790
important in this course so you have to

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:41,110
set a new name for this new share and

00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:44,690
set the permissions who can read this

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:47,510
network shares and who can write into to

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,790
network shares and on the client side

00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,380
you don't have to do anything on the

00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,140
windows grant you don't have to do

00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:59,960
anything the lyrics games also gets this

00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:03,320
information and the mac cans also and in

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:08,150
the middle of this picture you see cloud

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:09,860
for education micros will tell you a few

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:12,470
things about health education in a few

00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:16,130
minutes that's also very important

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:20,860
together with this network shares you

00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:24,500
can also use the local the internet

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:27,490
network shares outside your school or

00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,490
your company

00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:34,580
so here you see the overview of all your

00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:38,330
network shares you can easily create a

00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:40,970
new you can rename it every day if you

00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:45,860
want or you can remove it it's quite

00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:49,340
simple but it works very very well then

00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:54,980
a last-gasp motor is client management

00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:58,370
you can add new rooms if you want here

00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:02,030
are four rooms definite and you can put

00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:04,700
all your clients into separated rooms so

00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:08,120
you have an overview of all your glands

00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:11,650
and workstation in your school and you

00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:14,390
can also use wake-on-lan and

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,640
automatically shuts down scripts so you

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:24,460
can manage all your clients from the

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:24,460
server okay now to the outfit occasion

00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:36,800
okay now Calif education is another

00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:41,540
feature we've quite proud of you may

00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:46,040
know own cloud the cloud hosted on your

00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:48,560
own servers such a like file hosting and

00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:52,730
everything and we combined it with our

00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,190
service education so it if you install a

00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:57,140
sort of education on the web server it's

00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:59,930
the cloud education is automatically set

00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:03,080
up and it's fully integrated in the

00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:08,600
whole last module system and everything

00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:11,150
and you can share you can save in the

00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:15,710
cloud calendars Canada events contacts

00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:18,260
files etc and well important feature we

00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:22,850
combined it with the normal home

00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:25,940
directories of the users so if they put

00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:28,130
a file in if they are in the school to

00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:30,140
save a file to the home directories or

00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:33,080
something and when they're at home to

00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:35,000
know they get 0 and need this file for

00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,130
my homework or something they just log

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,660
into the cloud for education and can

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,440
download this file from their home

00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:46,040
directories

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:51,810
and now and there's also a shared folder

00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:53,880
you can do shares for singing classes or

00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:57,870
courses or something or just groups of

00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:02,130
students yeah the access to the cloud

00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:05,970
for education is via web interface for

00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,620
school web server you know the web

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:13,500
interface quite works quite well you

00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:18,150
have a demo light later on there's

00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:21,840
feather also clients for every major

00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:25,320
operating system linux mac and windows

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,960
and additionally you can access the

00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,670
files via web tough you can just mount

00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:34,830
it or on your linux or mac system and do

00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:39,300
a little do some stuff with it on

00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:43,110
windows if you yeah we know this bit

00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:45,840
more complicated also you can you can

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:50,280
get the calendar events or contact were

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:54,450
killed off or cut off works as well just

00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:56,670
mounted just enter the world in the in

00:32:54,450 --> 00:33:01,280
your calendar or contact management and

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:06,090
here already ready to go and me and

00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:09,660
they're also a mobile kinds like for iOS

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:16,350
and Android and maybe the real term for

00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:19,040
windows mobile but so it's just go to

00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:19,040
the live demo

00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:42,730
so the login screen is quite similar to

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:45,130
own couch just with our logo so this is

00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:49,060
the starting page if you login there's

00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:56,950
the demon Sam it's the shared folder for

00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:59,140
everything and your home directory yeah

00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,320
here you can see the shared folder

00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:05,260
there's folders for singing classes or

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,390
single courses or singly teachers whose

00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,580
just say I want all my students to have

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:16,149
decent this file or this presentation or

00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:19,379
anything yeah you can open up plain text

00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:23,770
files and I think PDFs right in the

00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:29,409
browser in the web interface just look

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:32,050
and oh and also image files and yet the

00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:35,200
newest versions of own code also support

00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:45,010
video files right in the browser yeah

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:50,460
we'll be in the next version you can see

00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:50,460
it's this is a desktop background

00:34:54,060 --> 00:35:05,730
I don't don't don't translate that so

00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:08,010
kiasu education it's a yeah it's quite

00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:11,850
in quite easy way to access your files

00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:14,820
from home and and especially the mobile

00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:18,810
devices get great response from the

00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:30,480
students and teachers alike teachers if

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:33,360
they know how to use a smartphone thank

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,670
you God fabrication is fully integrated

00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,040
into the server for education if you add

00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:39,690
users and groups and files into the

00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,200
server education you also have

00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:46,740
everything in the cloud for education

00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:50,760
and now our earliest project its so

00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,280
called realized lab that's you way how

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,920
to manage all your workstations at

00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:02,090
school or at home if you have more than

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:06,240
one MVC the idea behind this project is

00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:10,800
every client has a small minimized pace

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,680
system we used back best practice at

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:20,820
eviane system because it's very very

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:25,160
small using a few MP ramps and over this

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:28,080
base system you start your ex server and

00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,040
every operating system you want to use

00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:38,400
is just running on an individual box

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:41,340
session and you can install this system

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,870
on every client or you can use the

00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,230
server education for the deployment

00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:49,040
because if you have a surfeit occasion

00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:54,830
and all your groups and users and

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:58,500
network shares you can also use the

00:36:54,830 --> 00:37:05,330
pre-installed peaks eserver you can put

00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:07,950
up your client press f some function to

00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:11,310
some function button on your cable

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:13,800
and you will get a screen from the Big C

00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:19,440
server and you can choose install a

00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:24,180
realized left card and a small system as

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:26,880
a fear for the automatically

00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,700
installation of tpn is running over this

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,560
computer and after 5 minutes you have

00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:36,840
full operating client with everything

00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:41,310
pre-configured and you can just begin

00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:44,010
your work 25 minutes they have a small

00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:47,400
mid alized based system and if you want

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:52,320
to use Windows or Windows XP or Windows

00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:54,870
7 or test of education or punto and so

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:59,120
on you just have to copy all these

00:37:54,870 --> 00:38:02,580
little box images over the network from

00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:06,000
managed by the server you can select all

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:10,620
your clients you want to have windows XP

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,550
and justification for example and UDP

00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:21,990
cast will deploy all your images out to

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:25,350
the Giants and very good benefit of this

00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:30,440
system is you have remote access to all

00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:33,720
your clients nobody really knows that

00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,280
there is nothing add as just a little

00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,950
box machine running in the system

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:43,860
because it's full screen you don't see

00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:47,580
the base system and the users can do

00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:49,800
everything with their little box images

00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:54,120
because they are just read only they are

00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:57,480
temporary right excess on these images

00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:59,910
but if you want to restore everything

00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,760
you just have to reboot the machine or

00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:06,950
the VirtualBox machine and everything is

00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:10,230
resetted and you can easily deploy audio

00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:12,200
images just from the server and you can

00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:14,820
wake up audio clients automatically

00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:22,850
placed on vehicle down and you can shut

00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:22,850
