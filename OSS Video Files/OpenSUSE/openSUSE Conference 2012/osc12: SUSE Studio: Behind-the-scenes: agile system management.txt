hello everybody let me introduce nickel

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:13,009
shreds is a director in Susa and he will

00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:17,369
tell you something about souza studio

00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:20,070
thank you so my responsibility is su

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,779
estudio and virtualization and along

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,900
with me in the room we also have James

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,000
10 easier in the first row is an

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,179
engineering manager for the studio team

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,940
so in case you have any deep technical

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:34,940
questions or complaints he's the one

00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,899
complains to me I'm fine with it all

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:48,149
right so who obvious used this to do

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:51,570
already quite a bit cool so let me do a

00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:53,879
brief recap of why are we doing this and

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,070
what's the studio is about and then the

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,640
end if verse time left let's do a quick

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,329
quick demo so this is my favorite slide

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,360
when talking about the studio so when

00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,140
you want to do anything in your life in

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,750
software or hardware or anything you

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:16,920
want the thing usually to work to just

00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:20,909
work you just want to plug it in and use

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,790
it verse like no setup needed nothing

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:28,619
nothing fancy you want to wake up in the

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:33,390
morning turn it on make your bread and

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:38,490
then go to work so there are few things

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:41,280
which you want this thing to do it has

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:47,250
to do with one thing you expect from

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:49,320
that from a tool to to perform and to to

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,100
do it well like if you put the bread in

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,380
you want to have a bread done it can be

00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,619
burnt and it can be rare it just needs

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,799
to be just forward one paste and it's

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:05,329
possible to tune the toaster for it and

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:09,330
also it's a requirement this minimal

00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:12,060
assembly needed like you don't want to

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,620
to fiddle with your wiring in the

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,110
morning when you wake up

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:21,830
just want to turn it on and and have it

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:25,590
so how does this apply to software when

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,840
you install the software and I assume

00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,019
all of you do it or did it at some point

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,540
in time it's a lot of stuff to take care

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,519
even before we software is actually

00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,610
installed so of a new receive a manual

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,920
and the many various lot of pages

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,780
describing what you have to do what you

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,709
have to install how to tune the

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:48,750
operating system how to turn all the

00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:50,640
knobs in the right way so that the

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,489
application runs first at all and

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,319
secondly also a tweet runs in an optimal

00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:59,819
way so we took a look at some manuals

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,379
and how they look like and this is a

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,510
menu of one specific database and this

00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:09,150
is about the installation it's not about

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,790
management not about anything like post

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,359
installation is all about making the

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:20,220
database run and if you take a look at

00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:22,319
those steps needed in detail you you can

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,410
see that the pre installation

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,260
installation part is actually majority

00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,690
of other steps needed like vast

00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,139
majorities pre-installation so you need

00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:37,230
to make sure that all those broken

00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:40,980
sister things are set to rights values

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:44,190
but right the libraries are installed

00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,669
right right command line utilities and

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,790
you can see in the green and yellow that

00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:53,370
all this is always has to happen even

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:57,090
before you run the application also

00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,560
steps needed to to do once you install

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:05,940
it but it's usually not not too much so

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:09,690
what do we do with this to do our thing

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:15,389
about always and how to simplify the

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:18,989
life over go like admin and allow him to

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:21,090
do stuff in an easier way of an by

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:24,570
reading all those manuals and doing all

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:26,760
those steps and the idea is quite simple

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,860
you just take

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,990
application you take the operating

00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,540
system you take everything it needs like

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,470
utilities libraries but all the

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:40,560
configuration files data or essentially

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:45,030
any arbitrary stuff you wrap it in in

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,550
one box and you make that one box and

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,190
image or an appliance an installable

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:55,380
thing which you can deploy anywhere you

00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:58,350
want and this makes the life of an admin

00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:01,080
much easier in a respect that you know

00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:03,480
what that image has because you created

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,360
it and you have a complete control and

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,540
all the settings of a software is

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,150
installed there and not only it makes it

00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:14,040
easier to deploy the dimension to deploy

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,890
an application it makes it much easier

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,800
to do the support later on because if a

00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:23,820
the user calls you in a week that he

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:27,120
installed some something somewhere you

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,760
don't need to trigger some Sherlock

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,860
Holmes to figure out what exactly he did

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,140
there and fully installed what he

00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,960
removed you just know what's fair

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:42,240
because it's what you built before as a

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:46,350
as an image so Studio allows you to do

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,510
all this you can easily build images in

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,090
a matter of minutes and I mean if

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:54,480
wireless works here I can i will show

00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:58,620
you how it works and it's really a

00:05:54,480 --> 00:06:02,130
minute so you take the basic operating

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,900
system you take the additional software

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,380
you install it and to you build and

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:10,890
you're done one important thing to

00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,930
mention here is that this to do is it's

00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:15,060
like a product we offer to our customers

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,310
but it's also available as an online

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,920
service it's free of charge so anybody

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,930
can can try it so whatever i'm talking

00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,780
about or where i'll be showing to you

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:27,240
you can go to this video com try to

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:32,780
yourself see for yourself how it how it

00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:39,510
looks like what it supports in terms of

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:40,560
target formats and deployment methods it

00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:43,139
can boil down

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,230
to free basic groups its physical media

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,820
its virtual images and its cloud

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,570
deployments so here with respect to

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,419
physical media you can create an iso

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:55,860
like live CD you can create a

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:57,630
installable I so you can create the disk

00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,610
image you can create a USB stick image

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,810
all those regular stuff you you you use

00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:06,860
virtual images you can create for all

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:10,230
major I providers including kvm Zen

00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,530
lately also hyper-v VMware obviously as

00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:15,419
well and you can take these virtual

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,290
images to the calc as well so you can

00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:22,530
take vic a vm image and upload it to the

00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:25,260
cloud you can have a amazing specific

00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,440
images and what we have done a couple of

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:32,910
months ago so is a support for microsoft

00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,500
azure microsoft public cloud the really

00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:37,530
interesting thing here is that we have

00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:40,440
one source for all these formats so you

00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:43,470
can have like one definition one set of

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,300
software one set of data and you build a

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,910
couple of images from wet one set and

00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,490
have em deployed in in different

00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,310
different environments so this allows

00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,169
for really easy move from physical to

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,450
virtual deployments like if you have a

00:07:55,169 --> 00:07:59,460
bit eccentric of a couple of servers and

00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,800
you want to make when virtualized you

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,840
take ladonna me image you rebuild it as

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:09,000
a let's say as a kvm in image you create

00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,460
a hypervisor box and you can you can go

00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,750
virtualized and say for cloud so it's

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,760
very easy to take your current

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,340
deployments upload them to book to

00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:21,410
Amazon ec2 and see how it how it

00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:25,680
performs fair so it's it's pretty cool

00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:27,570
one component of sis to do is what we

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,370
call sue the gallery it's something like

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,440
an app store where if you have your

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:33,419
images you can you can publish them for

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,969
wee hours to use the others can call

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,979
them they can use them so it's something

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,740
you can give to your colleagues to your

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,460
customers to your users and having

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,730
haven't

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:48,860
give them an easy way how to how to take

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:52,440
the remedies you your building studio

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:56,220
what next before i go to demo just

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,550
reminder about the studio com online

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:02,040
version so let me switch to to firefox

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:10,110
and show you how it looks like any

00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:15,300
questions so far no right so let me sit

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:19,680
down a bit so i will need to watch the

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,480
big screen and five my final mouse so

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,600
diamond showing you right now is to just

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:27,510
a little comets online version so once

00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,120
you login you can see like the images i

00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,610
have built here on the left and i will

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,950
go ahead and create a new appliance

00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:37,950
right now so you can see some of the

00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,470
base templates it's like opensuse or

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:44,190
strannix enterprise and i can select

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:46,200
desktop server or juice and juices just

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,460
enough operating system is like really

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,130
bare bones minimal stripped-down version

00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:56,370
it's usually what what you want and I

00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,640
can build 64-bit and I grits a name and

00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:02,220
I create great empires and what it does

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,410
right now is it's creating configuration

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,500
of wet one image putting together basic

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:14,190
set of packages basic configuration data

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:18,630
which will be able to edit later on now

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:22,200
the there are few key taps here like

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:24,900
software typists is like the really key

00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:28,170
one where you can configure with sure

00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:32,910
which packages are are there let me

00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,380
maximize it a little bit so this is here

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,840
you can see which packages are where

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:39,540
couple more and let's say this would be

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:45,860
a web server so i will look for for

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:48,480
apache apache package and it will list

00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:50,220
packages i am going to edit here and

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,770
here in on the left you will see like

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,950
how many packages are selected what's

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:57,410
the what's the total number of

00:10:54,950 --> 00:11:00,980
gauges and you can also see the details

00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:03,260
of which changes i'm doing once i'm done

00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,870
with the paper packages and i can upload

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,850
my arbitrary rpms i can take the keys

00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:10,670
from opensuse build service or from my

00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,680
own repositories I do configuration I

00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:16,220
can change even network or can it add

00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:20,270
users firewall settings I can set the

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:22,760
locale like I'm going to deploy this in

00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:26,720
let's say Germany so I will put German

00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:30,920
local by default or I can also ask on

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,830
first boot weather like what would be

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,360
local to to be used in this case if I

00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:38,900
will be shipping that with image in

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:43,280
multiple countries I can personalize so

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:45,530
i can say like I like with fiscal more I

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,440
like this logo more I can upload my own

00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:50,390
logo so I can I pull my own picture so

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,790
what if i send it to all my users they

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,910
can see me each time they boot where

00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:59,780
image so we know who was one responsible

00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:02,510
for all this server settings i can set

00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:06,350
up database might be a good idea if its

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,660
web server some desktop settings some

00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,820
parameters according to the image

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,460
formats scripts i can run a car battery

00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:17,150
scripts at the end of each built or each

00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:21,260
run files it's like if you want are some

00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:24,230
some your data like images / or files on

00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:27,670
the image and once you are done with all

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:30,440
this you go to build and here you select

00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,630
which built which image you want to

00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:36,410
build so let's having USB stick is fine

00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:40,670
so i go ahead and build and what it does

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:43,040
right now is its collecting all the

00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:47,240
configured rpms or configure data and

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,280
it's putting the bill together and this

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,060
will take some time some i'm not going

00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,640
to wait for it but it's like about three

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,190
minutes until all the image is built so

00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:01,820
let me switch to the other tab where

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:04,310
where I have some stuff built already so

00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:06,470
this is what I built yesterday evening

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:08,360
just to make make sure that the stuff is

00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,779
here so you can see

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,779
is like 11 image it's like juice again

00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:18,019
based on suse linux enterprise server so

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,660
respect to 11c respect to this in this

00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:23,570
case and you can see all kinds of images

00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,120
i have i have booted i have created here

00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:28,279
and now you can download you can also

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,490
test the test image in 10 drivers

00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:34,269
actually cool feature so let's see if it

00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:37,630
works here so what it does right now is

00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:41,149
this is still running in my firefox and

00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:45,290
it's booting that image inside our own

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:48,019
data center so on our servers it's it's

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,690
booting the damage it's running VNC to

00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:53,860
the Firefox services like VNC client

00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:57,110
running in my firefox and it's booting

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,899
like but image you configure this is

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:10,970
booting right now so you should be able

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:13,310
to see the boot process eventually so

00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:17,390
with this very very useful feature in

00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:21,019
case you want to do like quick test and

00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:23,360
fix cycles so you boot the image you see

00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,399
what what has been fixed what you know

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,550
what needs to be fixed what needs to be

00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:30,440
added you change it and what's really

00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:34,279
cool is that you can actually record all

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,079
these changes back to to the previous to

00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:40,760
the original image so once it's rebuilt

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:47,269
you can you can have all your or changes

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:50,240
record it back so that's about that with

00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:52,519
this is a gallery component I mentioned

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,070
before yeah it's where you can publish

00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,250
your your own image so that it can be

00:14:55,070 --> 00:15:00,320
used by by avarice so you can see like

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,730
somebody so we already created a lamp

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:09,110
stack here and it's something like the

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:12,019
nukes Apache my sequel / or PHP or all

00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,120
the stuff and what you can do right now

00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:15,920
so you can just download and run it so

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:18,860
that you can have your your web server

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,710
right right at your hand or you can

00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:24,350
clone it and base your own image on

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:30,380
always and sacred work which somebody

00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:33,350
has somebody else has already done all

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:36,650
right I guess that's about that you can

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:39,020
have a look how how built progresses

00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,630
meanwhile so you can see like it's been

00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:45,230
three minutes and Andrew built has been

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:50,210
mostly mostly done or it's actually

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:55,690
almost finished all right so I guess

00:15:50,210 --> 00:16:01,430
what's about that any questions egbert

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:04,550
to take a my crease could you go back to

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:09,380
the start it cannae where it shows which

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:11,530
platforms you support okay I can go back

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:17,240
but I can also tell you it supports

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:32,570
32-bit and 64-bit intel AMD and it also

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:35,750
supports IBM system z right so r me

00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,310
something which we have hurt already a

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:41,540
couple of users would be interested in

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,700
it but it's been like it will be quite

00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,550
some effort mainly because it's like

00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,980
noted supporting in opensuse nor nor /

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,350
so we need to do first up there maybe

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,050
when we go see what needs to be done

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,450
over studio side in general it's quite

00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:58,700
some tuning because just to do is it to

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,890
to make all this stuff really easy so we

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:03,620
need to figure out whatever like the

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:05,240
best shortcuts to like height the

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,659
complexity of the installation from the

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:14,649
user yes

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:17,739
are you saying that the web-based free

00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:20,499
souza studio supports system z targets I

00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:24,489
thought that was only the pay for

00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:27,579
product yes the studio supports building

00:17:24,489 --> 00:17:35,320
systems he targets but the vet is only

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:38,919
running on x86 or interim d so you still

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,899
need to have the UI running and envy you

00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:45,309
i you can create a system z image and

00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:47,379
wet one is suitable for System z

00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:59,919
deployments but the UI itself is running

00:17:47,379 --> 00:18:01,479
only on on int'l md yes please don't

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,509
know if you have time but maybe you

00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:09,309
could do a demo of uploading to a cloud

00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:11,759
hosting service do you have i can i can

00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:14,919
show you i don't think i have a

00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,409
credentials really configured here but i

00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:23,289
can show you how it's done so let me go

00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:25,749
to the other what I built already so

00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:28,440
here you can see the Amazon ec2 image

00:18:25,749 --> 00:18:32,080
which is which is already built you can

00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:34,809
well I can just upload it from from here

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,249
and let's see if it works so here you

00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:41,200
can see vm as an ec2 dashboard and i

00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:44,799
have some some instance already running

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,229
apparently and i can say like i'm going

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:50,200
to upload this image in this version i

00:18:47,229 --> 00:18:53,379
pick a pic a region like whatever I

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:55,779
reliant is the closest one and I can

00:18:53,379 --> 00:19:00,999
even lounge for instance so let's say

00:18:55,779 --> 00:19:03,009
micro instance is enough and let's see

00:19:00,999 --> 00:19:06,429
how it how it works out right now but

00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:08,710
there should be it so just clicking on

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:11,489
with one upload button which I actually

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,489
did

00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:20,870
yeah possibly wrong credentials but

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,090
anyways I mean this is how it how it

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,820
should work you just build a bit image

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:28,790
and you configure or msn credentials

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,580
upload it and in a matter of minutes it

00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:37,640
should be in visible in your Amazon

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:40,340
management console yeah Asher is the

00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,240
same thing if opens take what we have

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:45,800
done is we actually implemented

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,440
automated mechanism that allows you to

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,900
want to do once we image is built it

00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:57,190
will automatically show up in an

00:19:50,900 --> 00:20:01,520
OpenStack dashboard or in lots of stuff

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:03,290
grinds in image repository immediately I

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,870
kid won't be allowing the instances from

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,550
studio but any image which is built for

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:09,890
OpenStack will be automatically showing

00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:16,820
up in glance so that people will be able

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:19,940
to launch it from there sorry maybe I've

00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:22,280
been tamed in attention enough but in

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,350
this when you select your software you

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:30,050
can also upload your own software your

00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:32,180
own RPM packages okay yes so yeah I just

00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,640
want to quickly at one point so for the

00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:37,040
details of uploading to Amazon ec2 and

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,100
Microsoft Azure and using the automatic

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:43,640
input from studio to the cloud you can

00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,080
look at our block so blogger com so

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,820
there are screenshots there are detailed

00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,770
explanations about how all these work

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:53,450
you know and of course will be around so

00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:56,810
you can just grab us yes finger yes

00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:06,530
please I don't know if a cable is long

00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:08,600
enough yes if somebody wants to to

00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,630
deploy to make images with to the studio

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,870
to to sell them what are his options he

00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:19,310
can obviously by Zeus to do but is there

00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:23,060
a pay-per-use model if somebody says and

00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:27,240
Souza studio is is a big investment and

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:30,090
I don't have make much business was

00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,510
this appliances is there a pin something

00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:38,450
like a pay-per-use model for that kind

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:41,520
of small customer so for us to do itself

00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,760
not yet is either you can use to do

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:47,070
online which is free of charge anybody

00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,380
can use it to build their stuff or so

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:51,870
this to do on-site installed on your

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,610
premises in saradenta center and it

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,179
comes with some other two link ID for

00:21:53,610 --> 00:22:00,470
updates and stuff they've been thinking

00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:02,880
about making something like paper use

00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:14,400
for a force to do online but we don't

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:16,980
have it yet so with respect revert back

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,490
to the images itself it depends on what

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:22,650
you base your image on so you can use

00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:25,860
you can use up to do online with

00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:28,590
opensuse and there are when they are

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:33,300
basically free of charge off on anything

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:37,170
but if you use enterprise images it's

00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,179
like a standard / license and also you

00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:42,480
can I mean there is an option to have an

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:45,290
agreement between you if you are let's

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:49,170
say a nice V or OEM and Souza and

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:51,330
depending on the amount of like images

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,240
or appliances you would be selling you

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:58,230
can of course negotiates like a specific

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:08,030
agreement between those two companies it

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:08,030
all works all right other questions

00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,000
