	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,840
how do we good all right excellent so

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:12,360
good afternoon everyone hey there um yes

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,450
was so kind to draft me for thee so why

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,240
does all of this matter talk which this

00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,310
one is so the challenge was how do you

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,580
explain to someone who has no idea of

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,939
computers why what we are all doing here

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,980
matters I find that a very interesting

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,170
challenge because I don't know about you

00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,880
but trying to explain this sometimes two

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,860
people who have absolutely no connection

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,989
to software can be difficult so the talk

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,980
is as you see what you don't understand

00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:47,760
will still control you and there is

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:52,890
something that I thought of last night

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:56,780
actually as a fairly apt way of starting

00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,780
into the presentations and alas

00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,750
Master buttons one or the installed

00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:08,170
voice recognition technology us left the

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:12,100
other bass voice recognition technology

00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:15,100
and a left and Scotland never tried

00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:20,890
voice recognition technology no they

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:30,090
don't do scottish accents 11 could you

00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:34,510
please repeat that 11 11 11 I love it

00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:39,280
could you please repeat that I love

00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:45,940
bidden whose idea was us you need to try

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:50,619
an American accent 1111 since are you

00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:53,110
show me that doesn't it 11 better than

00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:56,020
that cuz i don't want I'm sorry could

00:01:53,110 --> 00:02:04,060
you please repeat that try an English

till I'm not going story

00:02:46,090 --> 00:03:00,020
11 11 11 this is a voice-activated

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,450

manner um come girls I've come and fit

00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,430
why is it telling people to become

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,930
because they knew they'd be see honesty

00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:17,860
storage people would be going out for

00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:17,860
not sir you have not selected a floor I

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,340
if you would like to get out of the

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:27,190
elevator without selecting a floor

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:33,700
simply say open the doors please please

00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:41,840
please suck my wall in your sleep please

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:46,820
I'm the big enough for muffin open the

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:51,410
doors please please pathetic please

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:56,170
remain calm when you out tonight no no

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:56,170
no you just wait for it to speak

00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:04,300
you have not selected a flower these

00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:06,460
balls I'm buddy Tommy America I'm gonna

00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:13,770
faint what about this I just give your

00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:13,770
voice and I'm going to stop

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,020
good up

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:42,120
so actually software does run our

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,600
everyday world right most people just

00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,450
never think about it or actually have

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,930
any conception of what that means now

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:55,550
this one was obviously quite funny but

00:04:51,930 --> 00:05:00,360
then some of that is not very funny um

00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:04,880
you see so people have already managed

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,950
to successfully our takeover pacemakers

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:12,150
over like and distance of thirty feet

00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,580
sometimes so 10 meters away they've

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:18,060
broken into cars remotely so driving

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,480
next to the car uh over Bluetooth took

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:26,190
over the car and were able to actually

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:31,890
activate gas pedals breaking steering so

00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:34,350
effectively it's possible to stop a

00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:38,660
human's heart remotely without touching

00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,820
them without any visible sign whatsoever

00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:45,900
so if that isn't black magic I don't

00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,150
know what is I mean that is why in the

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:51,560
abstract for the stock I was talking

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:54,600
about how this is almost like sorcery

00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,570
there is an incredible amount of power

00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:01,620
in all of this and the people who wield

00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:03,930
that power effectively are the

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,880
modern-day wizards or sorceress or

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:13,400
magicians or whatever have you so when I

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:17,760
say wizard I need people like this guy

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:21,540
this is Tesla right Tesla was a wizard a

00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:23,550
magician of his age today it is very

00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:27,000
well possible he possible he would be a

00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,410
software developer it's not actually

00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,340
unconceivable that he would be doing

00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:36,390
software today so these are the people

00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,460
who build our society and who built

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,130
controlled control structures into

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,800
society because this is old I mean if

00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,470
you have the power to control that lift

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,710
if you have the power to stop the heart

00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:51,810
to steer the car that is an incredible

00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:53,550
amount of power and softwares everywhere

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,310
now every one of us carry software on

00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,080
the matter all times these days and then

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:01,800
the question obviously becomes when

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,940
software is power who wields it is it

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:10,349
this guy well actually to some extent

00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:14,009
you almost wish it was him because he

00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:17,789
looks benevolent he actually looks like

00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:20,190
a nice guy I mean he looks like like one

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:23,490
of plenty of geeks I know who are

00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:25,620
genuinely nice people so if anything

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:28,500
actually I prefer this over the actual

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,340
reality of it because it's also not our

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,770
governments that control this I mean our

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,430
governments are at best like the pet in

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:41,039
the passenger seat of the car here the

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,830
power of software right now is wielded

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,759
to the largest extent by very very large

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:51,120
corporations unless you free yourself

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:56,310
from that deliberately you make a choice

00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:00,599
to actually control that law code if you

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:03,389
will yourself it's a Lawrence Lessig

00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:07,560
Stanford Law Professor who put out this

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:10,409
very famous quote code is law because

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,419
determines the rules by which our

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:17,849
society functions and in fact I would

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:21,080
always maintained that to some extent it

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:25,199
is even more effective than law is

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:28,080
because where you can always choose to

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,629
bit disobey law for important reasons

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,370
say you have your pregnant wife next to

00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,890
your driving really fast to the hospital

00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:36,899
because something is wrong and yes I

00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:38,550
mean you may have to you know talk to

00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,019
someone afterwards the police may stop

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,310
you but then they may even escort you to

00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:45,120
the hospital to make sure you get there

00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:47,459
safely you can ignore law for good

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,040
reason even though you may have to bear

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:54,720
consequences for it you can never obey

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:57,070
code I mean the code will always to at

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,710
all times stick

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,690
to its designed function you have no way

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:04,600
to argue with the code you have no way

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:07,930
to say oh but this one's I really really

00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,430
really need to I mean if that were

00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:11,230
possible it would be a lot more

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,330
convenient because we've all been in the

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,130
situation that we really had to do

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,960
something who were just in a place where

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,820
we hid enough network access or whatever

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,320
they did you know just these five

00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:28,300
minutes please but that's not how code

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:31,540
works code is immutable in that sense

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,910
and it is written by people who had no

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,900
idea of the situation which you would be

00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:40,390
and then most of it is controlled by

00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,520
purely economic interest from very large

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:49,960
companies who are typically not on this

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:52,900
continent even there are some people who

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,120
thought this was an issue and those

00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,650
people started the free software

00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,500
community the free software community

00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:06,010
has four very simple principles for its

00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:09,970
code to consider it free software open

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:12,220
source whatever have you that's the Four

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:16,090
Freedoms that's the freedom to use the

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:19,060
software for any purpose the freedom to

00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:23,170
study the software so you can understand

00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:25,360
what it does the freedom to share it so

00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:27,490
to pass it on to someone else and the

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,070
freedom to improve it so when it doesn't

00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,650
do what you needed to do to actually

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:35,320
make it solve your problem and then pass

00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:37,540
it along if you want to note that these

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,730
our freedoms right they're not

00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,860
obligations you don't have to use any of

00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:44,140
the software no one can make you you

00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:46,030
don't even have to distribute it no one

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,650
can force you to do that these are

00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:50,350
freedoms that you can exercise your

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:57,490
fundamental rights is a free software

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:59,680
citizen if you will if there's only one

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:03,160
thing that you can tell someone about

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,630
what is free software I would always

00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:10,630
choose those four words because from

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:14,890
there you can effectively and

00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:19,960
italy always understand the entire space

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:21,610
of what makes an actual like free

00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:28,590
software universe I mean everything

00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:28,590
follows from there and then of course

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:39,880
it's a classic I know and then of course

00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:42,190
there is the whole thing about the

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,170
terminology so I had this question this

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,240
morning in the end the round table so I

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,380
just put it in here again so someone

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,630
asked so what's the difference between

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:54,520
free software and open source of my

00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:58,360
response was a number of letters because

00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,210
ultimately all of these terms refer to

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,280
the same for freedoms there's a history

00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,790
to these terms there's personalities

00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:08,470
behind the history to these terms free

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,690
software is the oldest term in this

00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,940
bunch it's been used for a long time

00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,620
debbie has then picked it up then the

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,210
open source definition came along used

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,030
abeyance definition of what is free

00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:22,380
software some people said oh lets you

00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:25,900
know somehow you know find a term that

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,910
brings together the difficult characters

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:32,830
on both sides and you know called it

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:35,580
force or floss and whatever but don't be

00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:38,680
mistaken all of these ultimately are

00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,560
about the same thing about software that

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,870
gives you four freedoms use study share

00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:49,990
improve whichever term you use is your

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,670
personal choice I have a preference for

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,710
free software sometimes I use open

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:57,310
source because in the context that makes

00:12:53,710 --> 00:13:03,880
sense but in the end it's all about

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:05,470
software freedom so it's kind of stupid

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:09,160
that we still have to talk about this

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,800
it's 2012 you know it's been a while but

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,700
we still get that question so I just

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,630
thought I'd get it out there so what are

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,930
the consequences of those four freedoms

00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:25,180
there's a whole bunch of social

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:32,380
consequences that fall out of software

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:36,250
freedom empowerment is one of them this

00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:38,890
is a telecenter it's actually fairly old

00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:42,760
set of pictures I took them myself in

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,890
Brazil near cell Paulo and the

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,330
telecentric program in Brazil was one of

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,220
the big inspirations for actually a

00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,620
whole load of similar initiatives around

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,590
the world because they used free

00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:57,910
software to build centers where people

00:13:53,590 --> 00:14:01,780
who otherwise have very little to no

00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:06,340
access actually could go learn about

00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:09,730
computers look for jobs online do also

00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,680
write email I don't think Facebook

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:13,480
existed in those days so probably not

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,720
too faith did facebook then but probably

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:20,530
now whatever they were doing but the

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,960
point was it gave people access it

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:27,550
empowered them to actually participate

00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,890
in society and build a life for them

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:33,480
because otherwise they had very few

00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,480
